10tl0s7,"So I'm in Peri, but so far I've noticed things don't bother me as much as they did before. Like IDGAF....finally! I hated little things eating me up inside and now I'm telling myself, ""honestly honey, is it that real? No? Good....move on."" 

And BTW, I LOVE  those kicks Sis! Rock em!"
10tl0s7,"Just letting my hair go grey. I used to be a goth with all the make up, beautiful clothes and boots and now I'm just an old lady at the ripe old age of 51. No more rock nights and gigs.

I don't care, I just want a quiet life now. My biggest ambition is just getting a good night sleep without tossing and turning all night."
10tl0s7,"My SO and I started going to raves about 4 years ago. We‚Äôre often the oldest or among the oldest in attendance. Previously I would‚Äôve been too self conscious to be in public and stand out, but I don‚Äôt care anymore. And we have a blast!"
10tl0s7,"Love those shoes!  When I turned 50 I gifted myself my first tattoo (used to think I'd never want some permanent art on myself), now I have 4. Recently got some new ear piercings. Just reaching the age of ""I want to so I'm going to"" is pretty awesome."
10tl0s7,"I‚Äôve stopped carrying a purse. Which means I cannot wear anything that does not have pockets. I have a small tiny wallet like three cards which includes my ID (I use one of those rfid blocking sleeves), keys, and phone. No one can ever again ask me to carry something for them bwahahaha! Also the freedom of knowing I will never lose my purse again is so nice.  

I‚Äôve found that without the purse my stride is more purposeful. Not sure why really. But I like it. Combined with my murder face people scurry out of my way."
10tl0s7,"Loving me. Every inch of me. 

Forgiving younger me. I did what I thought was best at the time. 

Judging other women less. We‚Äôre all on the same team."
10tl0s7,Love the shoes!  My biggest change is I cut my hair and am now going back to dying it blue.  Been experimenting with green undertone blues but I think I like the purplish undertone blues more.  Will find out soon as it‚Äôs getting to that point where I want to change blues again.
10tl0s7,My field of fucks to give is entirely bare at this point. I dress in any way I like
10tl0s7,"Love it!  

Also if you see folks out there bucking the 'norm', make a point of letting them know you admire them!  We need to acknowledge those who own it!"
10tl0s7,Those are gorgeous! Where are they from?
10tl0s7,"I've posted about this before.   I've adopted a mantra.   It's ""I'll be the judge of that.""   So when I'm confronted by the ""shoulds/shouldn'ts"", that's my go to.     If I hear ""Oh, you shouldn't wear shorts after a certain age."" I immediately think ""I'll be the judge of that.""   or ""As women mature, they should wear their hair shorter"", I smile and say ""I'll be the judge of that.""   It's the same sentiment of ""having zero f's to give.""      I just really like the vibe of saying/thinking this mantra with a happy, confident delivery.     And as all the others have said, it's freeing.   To consider yourself the best authority on what you should and shouldn't do...............is priceless"
10tl0s7,"Those are beautiful shoes, I changed from only wearing red polish to very bright colors. Right now I have hot pink after removing luminous green üíÖ. Something so small but feels very empowering"
10tl0s7,GLITTER! I treated myself to practical pretty black sneakers and more crazy fashionable type sneakers with cats and flowers on it which I don‚Äôt wear as often because they‚Äôre not as comfortable but love it. I love us all dressing for what we want and if the world likes it cool - but not essential üòé
10tl0s7,I quit coloring my hair. I get more compliments on my natural gray hair than I ever did when I colored it. I often get asked who does my color. I answer Mother Nature.
10tl0s7,"I think I'm finally less hesitant to speak up if something bothers me. I've always been really meek and a people pleaser which means I've been anxious and miserable my entire life until now.

I love your shoes!"
10tl0s7,"I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm finally learning to feel my body, and see the effect of my people pleasing on it. I‚Äôm starting to learn to take care of myself, but it‚Äôs hard to find the emotional balance. For instance, in how I say ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù And I‚Äôm trying to be happy with letting people ‚Äúbe‚Äù, who don‚Äôt like that about me. So I‚Äôm learning to invest in myself."
10tl0s7,"\[tl;dr - I don't give a shit about anything right now and it's delightful\]

My favorite change is that I ran out of fucks to give.  I *legitimately* have zero fucks to give about *anything* right now.

You don't like my bright-as-hell red lipstick, my very long not-middle-aged-lady hair, or my big tits that I refuse to hide under a painter's smock or a heavy turtleneck sweater with a minimizer bra?  Zero given.

We're in a staff meeting and you interrupt me and then are aghast when I *interrupt you right back* with a swift, ""I'm not done yet, thank you"" and then *continue speaking right over you*?  Zero given.

You demand something and I say no and waitaminute that's not how this works and your feefees are bruised?  Zero given.

I drop something on my toe and yelp MOTHERFUCKER or I cuss and you don't think laydeez should speak that way?  Zero given.

I upend your world because you're A Man Who Knows All and now there's this Girl Who Should Keep Her Mouth Shut When The Men Are Speaking But She's Talking and it's upsetting you because that's not how you believe the world should work?  Zero given.

I'm a clearly middle aged woman driving a barky loud-as-hell muscle car and it makes your peepee feel small?  Zero given.

I tell you not to mansplain something to me that **you** asked me to help **you** with and you don't like that term?  Zero given.  (This one annoys the shit out of me.  Don't seek out my assistance and then fucking argue with me when I'm trying to, you know, assist you.  LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO DO.  **You** came to **me**, bruh, so how about you piss off down the road with your problem since your ego can't handle a lady knowing something you don't.  I fucking *swear to GOD, the audacity*.)

I'm a woman, existing in the world, not thinking about being ornamental and pretty and smiley for any swinging dick that strolls by?  Zero given.

**Zero Given** is pretty much my motto these days.  (Well, actually it's MORIOR INVICTUS but I digress)

I also made major, ***major*** changes in my relationship.  My husband has been and was (the past tense is important) a very reactionary dude.  He could be pretty jerky, and I walked on eggshells in fear of his moods.  He wasn't violent but he could be mean, dismissive, argumentative, rude, and hurtful in his treatment of me.  I was a SAHM for a long time, then said ""Eh, fuck this"", got a job, and skyrocketed up through the ranks both in title and in salary.  I now make more than enough to support me and my kids if I had to.  So...I sat his ass down, told him I was considering leaving his ass, and he was absolutely free to continue the way he was behaving because it had worked for him for decades but that it was no longer working for me.  And if he chose to continue to behave in that fashion, I was packing up my shit and the minor kids and the adult kids could come with and I was bolting out the door to live my life without his bullshit.  He chose wisely.  That was Thanksgiving and he has made real and measurable changes in his attitude, behavior, and treatment of me.  I would not have done that ten years ago.

Menopause has cut off the shackles of me being worried about making everyone else happy (Protip from this old broad:  You can't - so don't) and liberated me into the world of making myself happy, which I did not do for the first 50 years of my life but *definitely* intend to spend the rest of my life doing.

^(edit:  misspelled a word)"
10tl0s7,Love this! I just got the same shoes in black. I was hoping they would brighten up my perimenopause swamp witch aura at work.
10tl0s7,Oooh! I bought very similar shoes when I turned 50 and lost 3st in weight! They‚Äôre ‚ÄòI‚Äôm in charge now!‚Äô shoes.
10tl0s7,"I'm 42 and in peri, but I've now bought myself like 5 Hello Kitty tshirts and they make me so damn happy!"
10tl0s7,I am gonna vacation alone. Already did it once this year. It was spectacular.
10tl0s7,Those are pretty!!!
10tl0s7,I need those shoes
10tl0s7,"I've lost my self consciousness when it comes to dancing, much to my kids embarrassment.  I dance everywhere now give exactly 0 fucks üòÇ.  Walmart puts on a jam? Dancing down the aisle.  Restaurant turns it up? Dancing in my seat (haven't decided to dance on the table yet, but it could happen.) And on & on.  I completely love it!"
10tl0s7,"Hahaha I am loving all of these responses! For me, nose ring and considering <ahem> others, two new very visible tattoos and more planned, bought my first Dr Martens and wear them with everything, singing out loud all the time, practicing witchcraft, and basically saying ""fuck all"" to anyone that doesn't like it. This is me."
10tl0s7,"My hair, is very short, and blue. And I wear leggings all the time, and I have a bright yellow raincoat. And I don't care. I was a mostly black/ business casual person almost all the time in the before time."
10tl0s7,I feel VERY SMART at this stage of my life! I also feel like I am overflowing with ideas and creativity!
10tl0s7,"Nevermind the shoes, that tattoo is AMAZING!"
10tl0s7,"Rather TMI but I‚Äôve been constipated and today my body decided that any all shit would be set free so I let loose a metric ton shit that clogged a hotel toilet into oblivion.  My husband-to-be said ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù He located a plunger and rescued that poor toilet.  Back in the day I would have packed my skivvies and moved my mortified ass to Siberia to avoid any further embarrassment.  Instead, as he was getting the job done and saying ‚Äúeeeeew!‚Äù (for comic effect) I was sitting on the bed roaring with laughter.  He‚Äôs been teasing me in good fun about it all day and we‚Äôve been having a good laugh.  When I was young I couldn‚Äôt poop in the same vicinity as a boyfriend, let alone laugh about it.  But hey, shit happens. üí©

And also, I now know what matters.  Flowers, candy, PDA, Valentines Day is bullshit but a man who fixes your shit (literally), puts new brakes on your car without you asking, texts you to make sure you are ok,  loves you when you are at your worst‚Ä¶..that dude is your ride or die, a keeper.  I am damn lucky to have found mine ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10tl0s7,"There are no changes that I like in myself whatsoever--50+ blows chunks and can suck dick, honestly--but I am saying fuck it and doing what I want. I am going to be totally vain as hell and fight aging like I'm Conor McGregor? Yes I am. I just scheduled a blepharoplasty for the hooded eyelids I've hated all my life, and if this fucking gut of mine doesn't go away with exercise and starvation I'm damn well getting lipo and I don't care."
10tl0s7,"I've lost my self consciousness when it comes to dancing, much to my kids embarrassment.  I dance everywhere now give exactly 0 fucks üòÇ.  Walmart puts on a jam? Dancing down the aisle.  Restaurant turns it up? Dancing in my seat (haven't decided to dance on the table yet, but it could happen.  And on & on.  I completely love it!"
10tl0s7,I‚Äôve been working out continuously and I‚Äôm getting my teeth fixed with Invisalign. My confidence has increased so much. I‚Äôve also started really taking care of my skin and wearing more makeup at work. I‚Äôm getting compliments at work and it makes me feel really good!
10tl0s7,"Colors! I had a punk-rock phase in my late teens, then dressed very conservatively all through my adult life. Since Meno, it‚Äôs like a flip switched. Bought myself a neon blue vest that I looove. I forget I‚Äôm wearing it until I see the look on people‚Äôs faces as they pass me by hahaha."
10tl0s7,"Those shoes!!!! Wear them all the days. 
I‚Äôm 44 and in peri but for me the biggest change was being diagnosed with diabetes, loosing 40+ lbs and letting my hair go grey. So for background I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11‚Äù and I weighed 177lbs. Not shaming others who are alike but for me I was so fat. So I decided to put my health as a priory. Took me about a year to loose it all but I‚Äôve kept it off for close to a year now. The difference in how I look is enormous (no pun intended haha). Then in October 2021, I decided I was sick of coloring my hair every 4-5 weeks. I had been coloring it since I was 19. I had it cut super short pixie and within 3-4 months it was my natural hair color which is more silver than anything. And you know what? I look great! I get tons of compliments from both men and women‚Ä¶and I get hit on too (lol)

So the moral of the story is, do you. Do you so you feel like the rock star you are."
10tl0s7,"Where did you get these shoes? We could start a sparkly shoe society, like the red hat society but for Gen Xers!"
10tl0s7,Those rock! üòç
10tl0s7,LOVE those shoes! And the peacock feather tat!  You rock! I wanna get the shoes too. Where are they from?
10tl0s7,Adorable!!! I have a pair of silver glitter Converse and I love them :)
10tl0s7,"I am currently wandering around in a crazily patterned owl coat with zero f*cks to give.

10tl0s7,"I like not feeling guilty and being able to finally say no to things I don‚Äôt want to do.  My reason is ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want to‚Äù.  Period.  End of story.  If someone asks me for further explanation, they‚Äôre not going to get it!"
10tl0s7,"Perimenopause (and now menopause) taught me to be kind to myself.

It was because I had no other choice, some days, and I did fight it kicking and screaming the whole way...but still. Good lesson. Wish I'd learned it earlier."
10tl0s7,I bought bright purple shoes a while back. I'm generally invisible now so why not! :)
10tl0s7,"Former chronic people-pleaser who now no longer gives a rat‚Äôs ass what people think of me, brought on in part by working through some shitty life circumstances but definitely enhanced by perimenopause. It‚Äôs very freeing and I love it."
10tl0s7,"Hell, YES!  I turned 50 last May and promptly and proudly joined the IDGAF Club.  A little extra weight around my middle?  Who cares?  I‚Äôm going to have my cake and eat it, too, and maybe a second helping.  With ice cream on the side.  Gray hair that I go MONTHS without coloring?  Who cares?  I‚Äôll get to it when I get to it ‚Ä¶ or maybe not.  Making questionable outfit choices?  Sure.  If it matches and it‚Äôs comfortable, I‚Äôm wearing it.  Still listening to my 80s music?  Absolutely.  Watching my 80s movies, too, and still talking ‚Äú80s speak‚Äù.  I‚Äôm REALLY not sweating the small stuff anymore and really, it took me to the age of 50 to realize that it‚Äôs 90% NONSENSE."
10tl0s7,"I'm still in peri-menopause, but I decided to stop messing with my hair.  I finally realized I had no joy in coloring my hair, going to the salon, buying countless products and hair accessories, spending far too much time on my hair each day, worrying about having the windows down in the car and having my hair blow and get messy, split ends, grey hair frizzies and keratin treatments.  So, I stopped coloring my hair, and when the only remaining hair color was just a pony-tail's worth, I cut it short with some Wahl clippers we already had at home.  Using a number-8 guide on the clippers, I did the sides and back, and then using hair cut scissors, I hand trimmed the top to the width of my fingers, and now I'm a proud salt-n-pepper short-n-spikey lady!   My family loves it, and it has been so freeing for me.  I feel so much happier.  I wish I had done this long ago, but I guess I just wasn't ready."
10tl0s7,"I‚Äôm in peri, but for me it‚Äôs getting more tattoos and piercings. :)

Love the shoes! ü§ò"
10tl0s7,"They are fabulous!!! 

I treated myself to a lovely pair of rainbow trainers in the summer. I love them! My kids are a bit embarrassed by me ü§£"
10tl0s7,"Tattoos, piercings, grew my hair out and dyed it all purple, and no fucks given anymore."
10tl0s7,I do love those shoes. And good for you - life is too short not to enjoy what appeals to you!
10tl0s7,"I want these shoes!!! I am like you - very extra - give me all the sparkles, and let me do my cringy ass dance moves! Also I tolerate way less bullshit from people - spouse, colleagues, students, etc and it‚Äôs absolutely invigorating!"
10tl0s7,"I bought myself 2 pairs of Vans, 1 covered in butterflies (butterfly gardening is my passion these days) and another tye dye pair. One of my sons said, ‚Äúyou got Vans?‚Äù And that was it no one else even noticed."
10tl0s7,"I no longer bother with shoes that look good but are are uncomfortable to wear. I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I chopped off most of my hair and stopped highlighting it. I like the strands of silver peeking through. My hair is thinning, thanks to menopause and COVID, so I‚Äôve decided if I lose more hair I‚Äôll tattoo my hairline with a fun design. Why not?"
10tl0s7,"Also, I wrote my manifesto and didn't say I absolutely fucking LOVE your kicks and I would like to know brand because goddamn, I'm gonna get me a pair posthaste!"
10tl0s7,"That's awesome!  I love the comments here.  

For me I've just gotten frumpy and taking on David Mitchell's approach to fashion:  ""One of the codes by which I live my life is that my appearance should be in no way noteworthy, but then again, not so unnoteworthy as to become noteworthy.""

I've accepted that I'm invisible unless someone needs something.  (Not to my family who are wonderful, the rest of the world.)"
10tl0s7,Yes! I also started dressing fun! For me!
10tl0s7,"I have always been ‚Äòextra‚Äô and ‚Äòembarrass myself‚Äô. Lol I had to explain to my daughter in middle school that I never embarrass myself.  It drove her nuts until she realized that her friends thought I was pretty awesome.  I grew up in a family where women were always overly concerned with how others perceived them and hated it, as did they because ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt understand how what I did reflected on them‚Äô. It was just gross. Enjoy you new freedom"
10tl0s7,"I LOVE YOUR SHOES.

I think throwing off repression and seeing who we are when we reject the patriarchal bullshit we have internalised is such a wonderful journey."
10tl0s7,Giving my lovely hairdresser free creative reign. I‚Äôm always pleased by the new looks he tries.
10tl0s7,I am embracing my autistic self. I don't give a shit anymore. I'm gonna be me! Love those shoes! I just got some platform rainbow crocs üòé
10tl0s7,"I have gotten back into my old arts background, but I feel blah all the time anyway. At least a painting gathering makes me feel cool for a while. I've met some new people, but I forgot how to try to make friends. I'm spectrumy , never been good at it, even worst now with the blahs. When I first saw the gen x whatever, I knew that was me! Like, whatever..."
10tl0s7,"I am way less judgemental.  Live your life!  Who cares how people want to live.  It doesn't affect me. I mind my own business.  I say ""not my business"" many times a day now.  It has freed me from so much drama."
10tl0s7,I've had bright magenta hair for almost two years now. I love it and I would have been too self-conscious to go out in public with it before menopause
10tl0s7,"I went through menopause early at 43. Best damn thing ever. My periods were horrendous. I'd miss work every month bc of cramps, migraines and blood loss. My BP hovered around 60/40 and I passed our when I stood up. 

I finally didn't feel like shit on a stick and now at 53 I'm living my best life and give  no fucks if it isn't about my kids or other actual important things. I wear a black leather jacket and boots every chance I get, I drive a sweet sports car and am enjoying the freedom to enjoy weed.

Getting older rocks."
10tl0s7,"So many things. One amusing one is for the first time in my life, I want a tattoo. I like yours btw!"
10tl0s7,This is maybe the best thread i have ever seen on Reddit.
10tl0s7,love your shoesü•∞ keep having fun!
10tl0s7,Yet to find one
10tl0s7,Jacket potatoes
10tl0s7,I like the shoes. üëç
10tl0s7,"That my fucks tank runs on fumes. There's just so much I honestly don't care about anymore and it's glorious. I'm 53 and done with peri, and aside from some hot flashes all good."
10tl0s7,They are so sparkly!! I love them! And I love your tat!! üòçüòçüòç
10tl0s7,u/inmyenergybubble did you make these yourself or buy them? They're fabulous!
10tl0s7,I have the same pair!
10tl0s7,OMG I absolutely LOVE those!!!!
10tl0s7,"Those shoes are the gosh dang bomb!!!  Good for you, Sista!!!  üíúü¶Ñüëë"
10tl0s7,Ooh I LOVE your tattoo!
10tl0s7,"Nothing positive yet, but, thanks for posting to give me something to look forward to seeing, celebrating & sharing."
10tl0s7,Your shoes are amazing üòª
10tl0s7,"Well let‚Äôs see, a much more financial stability, more mellow emotions, more grounded.

40s are much different than 50s. I was thrown into menopause for medical reasons at age 46."
10tl0s7,"I too am finding myself attracted to anything bright, sparkly, shiny, pretty. I see shoes like this for sale everywhere and my heart wants them all.  So weird."
10tl0s7,I love your tattoo!
10tl0s7,not giving a fuck
10tl0s7,Love it!  I wear what I want if anyone has a problem they can look the other way!
10tl0s7,"Idk if it‚Äôs age in general or what, but I used to be so anxious about people‚Äôs approval, doing things to fit in, be liked etc. and now, I just could not care less. I‚Äôm gonna go my own way and it‚Äôs so freeing to not care if someone will ‚Äúlike me‚Äù for it or not."
10tl0s7,Oh hell yea! I love those fn shoes so much! I'm wanting to be a bit more sassy in my style but I'm working on my menopausal low self esteem! ü§¨ I don't have the confidence yet. I'm 58.8 times around the sun.
10tl0s7,I sell those shoes in my store!
10tl0s7,Love the shoes and the extra attitude that comes with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10tl0s7," IDGAF what others think anymore. Too old to care what negative Nancy‚Äôs want to say or do. Love my life, be happy, love my friends and family. The end."
10tl0s7,You comin' to Mardi Gras this year? You'll fit right in!
10tl0s7,"This thread is so fantastic. For me, the biggest were things not GAF about wearing makeup on the regular anymore (gonna sweat it off anyway when that hot flash comes, so why bother?); being willing to speak my mind (even in situations that would normally intimidate the shit out of me); realizing (finally!) that I‚Äôm my own best advocate and I am also the boss of me; being very real about what‚Äôs going on and what I need in the moment and not GAF if it makes someone else uncomfortable (eg. ‚ÄúMorning colleagues, super grouchy this morning because I was up all night with anxiety and hot flashes so could use a little extra space today‚Äù); not feeling guilty about spending the extra money on me for once (therapy, massage, extra yoga class, purchases like your awesome kicks, OP ü•∞), and generally having a lot fewer fucks to give. Also: understanding other women more and realizing how effin HARD it is to be a woman in this world and extending the extra courtesy/empathy, even with the fiercest of Karen‚Äôs. Because I now also know that I‚Äôm only one hot flash away from a Karen at any moment myself."
10tl0s7,"I look after myself better. I eat better, I have better sleep habits, I drink less alcohol (far far less), I seek less stressful situations, just generally try to live better and I also prioritise my fitness routine. I feel so much better for it and am so much happier for it. I love the shoes and the tattoo, btw! Keep being extra!"
10tl0s7,"I LOVE your tattoo!!!

Mine is not giving a shit what strangers think"
10tl0s7,"Ugh I hope to get to a point like this and like so many others have commented, honestly I can't find any positives yet from being in peri..... I'm angry all the time, exhausted, cranky don't have as much patience. I am looking into hrt clinics in my area because I just can't continue to go on like this."
10tl0s7,"Love the shoes. My fake nails! I battled my whole life with loving nail extensions. I wouldn‚Äôt wear them for 6 months then feel bad about them because some people think they‚Äôre tacky. Now, i give zero fucks. I love my long nails. Eat my shorts"
10tl0s7,"I'll just be proud if I live long enough for the bleeding to cease, never mind the additional 12 months some genius added to that

Nice shoes, though"
10tl0s7,"My self worth is really high. It could be because I‚Äôm paying all the bills and doing really well at my job. I feel so in control of stuff, not medical but emotionally, very safe and comfortable."
10tl0s7,Tell me about those shoes!
10tl0s7,Wow :) FABULOUS shoes - I'm still not quite there yet. I worry about every little thing. More things make me angry than they did before. Like this morning I had a total meltdown ever nothing! Just end up having to apologise for more stuff in the end. It sucks tbh. I actually felt a little 'mad' neuron switch on in my brain.
10tl0s7,I wanna be like that. It just happen slowly over time? I‚Äôm in late 30‚Äôs and still thinks and worry about so small things. Slightly better than I was 20‚Äôs
10tl0s7,Thank you !!
10tl0s7,"Yes!  I don‚Äôt feel as insecure.  I have a lot of younger neighbors and you couldn‚Äôt pay me to be back in those insecure years.  The constant comparing, keeping up with the Jones.  Who cares???"
10tl0s7,"I stopped dyeing my hair over ten years ago, I‚Äôm 53 now and I don‚Äôt care. Sometimes I get compliments about my hair other times I get my own mother telling me my hair makes me look older, either way I couldn‚Äôt care less ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

My husband bought me a handbag üëú I liked yesterday that cost almost $500, it was the most expensive handbag I‚Äôve ever owned and I was feeling guilty. He just told me to shut up and enjoy it because I deserved it. I guess that my learning curve - stop feeling guilty for having nice things for myself."
10tl0s7,Being comfortable in your own skin is what matters most .. Be YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è
10tl0s7,"Oh man, I got nine solid hours a few weeks ago and felt 30 again the next day, started listening to Taylor Swift and everything."
10tl0s7,You are AWESOME!! And got me thinking I need to do the same !
10tl0s7,"We haven't been to a rave, but we go dancing. I'm the only one on the floor? IDC. It makes me happy , so I do it. ( I also wear clothes that are out of my comfort zone. )"
10tl0s7,Heck yes! I'm an old school raver and I still go out occasionally and dance for hours. My body complains loudly!!
10tl0s7,Tattoos are so wonderful and addictive!! Have fun!!
10tl0s7,"Yessss! Same thing over here. I justify the tats with ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm not getting any younger.‚Äù üòÅ"
10tl0s7,"I had one in college. I have gotten 5 in the last 2 years. I can't hide them all from my parents (very conservative and religious), and I have stood up for myself for the first time ever."
10tl0s7,"Lol, Murder Face. I didn't carry a purse for at least 2 decades, largely because none of my colleagues did either. Now that I'm retired (for now, we'll see), I can be as girly as I wanna be. Worth mentioning that I don't carry a purse to events and such, and that cardfold like you have goes in front pocket. Have had a couple of bump-n-rollers come up empty-handed as a result"
10tl0s7,I don‚Äôt care a purse either!! Good riddance !!
10tl0s7,"I stopped wearing a purse too! But it was mostly due to COVID‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt go out much, and if I did, not for long, and the purse was excessive. Now that things are more normal, I still don‚Äôt wear one, and I haven‚Äôt missed it yet!"
10tl0s7,your stride is more confident because you're not guarding your purse from being snatched. Hold that chin up high!

10tl0s7,I went the other direction I just don‚Äôt care about the small stuff‚Ä¶ I just enjoy life when I can. Tell your brain you prefer calm and easy ‚ù§Ô∏è
10tl0s7,"Just wait until your 50s.  You genuinely do not give a fuck.  It‚Äôs awesome!

Edit:  30s are hard.  Probably the hardest period of my life and I worried about *everything*.  It gets better ü§ó"
10tl0s7,"Oh Sis. It gets better. I am only 40, so not too far off from your age. Just a cpl years ago I was crushed by a realization.  

When something small happens that starts to eat you up, ask yourself this, ""does effect my life in these ways: can I still eat? Can I still breathe? Can I still poop? If I can answer YES to these questions, then it doesn't effect my life, I don't need it. This has helped me tremendously."
10tl0s7,"It will get better. I was a huge worrywart in my 30's. I was a hypochondriac, worried about work, etc. I still worry about work but it's a TON less. It's probably the only awesome thing about getting older that I personally have - I'm just not as much of a stress case!"
10tl0s7,"I used to be so careful about money, and any time I got something like a VISA gift card, it went to buying stuff for the household or the family.

Now I have a job and surplus cash?  I buy shit for myself.  I thrift on Poshmark, I buy shit on Amazon, I got to Target and cruise for Just Because I Want To items and I feel zero guilt about any of it.

I put everyone else first for the last 35+ years of my life and now it's my turn.  MINE."
10tl0s7,We women are so good at guilt aren't we?! Society conditioned us so well. üôÑüòí
10tl0s7,"I hate my skin in being past-menopausal at 42 but I love the shoes, where did you get them?"
10tl0s7,If the menopause involves listening to Taylor Swift I'm out!
10tl0s7,"You definitely should try it!! Thanks, you‚Äôre awesome too!! I really love those sneaks! üíé 

Yes, dancing and partying and staying up late - it‚Äôs really fun, and fun was something I‚Äôve always been too tense for, even as a kid. Therapy, newly discovered self love, and the not giving a crap that seems to come with age and/or menopause has really helped me prioritize myself, my own fun and my own pleasure. üíó"
10tl0s7,I love that so much!!! üíÉ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10tl0s7,"I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt discover it until my 40s! You must have some fun stories. 

It actually inspired me to get into better physical shape so I could really participate, but yeah, it requires a period of recovery afterward üòÇ"
10tl0s7,Ah yes that does make sense!
10tl0s7,I do a bleach bath when I feel really adventurous and if it works the way I want then good and if not who cares.  There are cool dark shades of every color.  Right now my grey strands and old bleached ones catch the color other wise it‚Äôs a nice highlight in the sun.

10tl0s7,"Oh it is!!! Especially with a cold wind.

Heck even men come up and compliment me on it. It is very striking.

10tl0s7,Thanks. Yea 30‚Äôs was kinda crazy ups and down. I wonder what my 40‚Äôs gonna look like.
10tl0s7,I recently got my illness worsen and I stop doing all the stuff I was doing before. Went through bedridden  and now slowly house bound. Which put me in mind states that this might be lifestyle I‚Äôm going to have when I‚Äôm really old since sometime my energy level is like 90 yo woman.  Then I realized the way I think and see thing will make my life r harder and I really have to change the way I feel.  I am detoxing from social media which helps bit
10tl0s7,Now if i could just hope the hrt helps my werid muscle fatigue always there 2yrs!! The obgyn didn't feel it could but they dont know.everything! I been to specialists and  nobody doin anything ughhhj‚ù§
10tl0s7,Thats awesome!! Loveit
10tl0s7,Yeah. I ask tge same things now that i‚Äôm 43. It does get better with age.
10tl0s7,Yes so much this. Well done you!

10tl0s7,I know right? Well anyway I‚Äôm learning to treat myself well these days üòÜ

10tl0s7,"Haha yes I do have a lot of stories. I think it takes me at least 4 days to recover now, longer sometimes!"
10tl0s7,"Ooh ignore my post up top (asking for shoe brand), I'm off to peruse Betseys!

Side note:  I have a pair of the craziest high stripper heels by Betsey Johnson that have corset detail up the back.  I never wear them because I don't really have anywhere to wear them (and despite my DGAF about anyone's feelings on my attire, I really can't wear these particular shoes to the office - I do have *some* \[minor\] limitations).  I don't wear them but I also can't get rid of them because they're just too incredibly **awesome**, so every now and then I put them on and prance around upstairs and then put them away again.

Here's a link to what they look like on ebay (and no I'm not selling them or affiliated with the seller, I just wanted you to see what they look like because they're amazeballs):  [https://www.ebay.com/itm/174649028721](https://www.ebay.com/itm/174649028721)"
10tl0s7,Thank you
10tl0s7,Better!  I really loved my 40s.  I gained a lot of confidence in most areas of my life.
10tl0s7,"Oh wow,  good for you! I admire your self-awareness. Social media is a great place to start. Also, any amount of time outdoors in the sun as many days as possible. Chair exercises with light weights will also help strengthen you. I'm working on myself too right now. I'm just starting. Stay strong. We're worth it."
10tl0s7,"Nixing social media has been HUGE for my mental health. I now only have this and snapchat. I use this for obvious reasons, and snapchat I use to chat with my daughter (22) most all day everyday lol (she loves me and I her! ü•∞) I encourage you to continue to detox from social media...its a toxic place and we don't need that mess. 

I am sorry to hear about your health and I feel for you. I hope things get back to a more normal state for you and you get your energy level back up. üòä"
10tl0s7,How frustrating! I hope you get it figured out. This is TORMENT.
10tl0s7,"are you taking a senior multivitamin? Also, I've found B-complex has helped me with fatigue and D3 + K has helped with inflammation"
10tl0s7,ü•∞
10tl0s7,Amaze balls indeed! I can understand why you‚Äôd never want to part with them. Perhaps they can just be ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù shoes? Thanks for sharing the link. I‚Äôm off to shop the Betsy Johnson site.
10tl0s7,"This!   40s was great.  Full of energy, clear head, kid becoming more independent.  Make the most of it because 2 years into 50s has sucked so far.  Oh and my eyesight has significantly decreased.   
I did get my motorbike learners permit this week tho.  Zero shits given.  Life is too short; it's playing on my mind that I've not the energy or mind that I used to.  So hard to do what you know is good for you."
10tl0s7,Thanks :) it‚Äôs sucks to be ill but I think I needed this to learn about it
10tl0s7,"Snap is good texting tool :)
It‚Äôs crazy how we feel FOMO from quitting social media but our childhood was no social media and I was just fine without them. 
Thank you so much:)"
10tl0s7,But what fatigue? My muscles are whats affected! Yes i take vitamin
10tl0s7,"Totally agree.  I felt great in my 40s until peri hit around 47.  I‚Äôm also 52 and damn, it‚Äôs a daily battle to make sure I‚Äôm doing all the right things regarding my health and getting enough exercise; planning for retirement; even just making sure everything is taken care of around the house. HRT helps but man I‚Äôm a lot more tired than I was in my 40s.  I do like not giving AF about what others think, though.  It‚Äôs definitely a trade off!

And my eyesight sucks now, too.  I have cheap readers scattered all around the house!

Edit: *struggle* not battle.  Meno brain üôÑ"
10vkznh,"We at r/menopause are trying to change that.  Not only is menopause rarely talked about, but viable treatment options, such as MHT/HRT is considered taboo, cancer-causing and heavily discouraged by most doctors.  

We need to demand more from our health care professionals and not feel like we have 'suffer through' menopause.  

*...also* know that hormonal bloodwork is not accurate and only tells you what your hormones were doing on that day.  If you are in perimeno (aka still have periods) then estrogen is certainly not zero.  Even in post-meno our ovaries continue to produce *some* estrogen."
10vkznh,"Preach, my sister.   As soon as this shit started happening to me, i started telling EVERY WOMAN I KNOW UNDER 40 about it.  And when i say everyone, i mean like even my 20yo daughter & her friends.   Idk why, and it definitely IS crazy-making, but nobody the fuck talks about it.  You are so right.  So it‚Äôs our job to start.  I know exactly what you mean.  ‚úäüèΩ"
10vkznh,"‚ÄúMenopause would not be so bad.‚Äù

WHAT A FUCKING JOKE!!!!

Like you, when peri/meno started to show up for me, I had no fucking idea why I was so messed up I‚Äôm so many ways. My PTSD, ADHD, anxiety and depression all got 10000x worse with the estrogen drop and I literally felt like I was dying or going insane or both. 

Like you asked: WHY DO WOMEN NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?!!!!!!!! I‚Äôm in my late twenties and since I got bitch slapped with meno, I‚Äôm talking to anyone and everyone who will listen so they know what to expect. I‚Äôve also been able to bond with older women in cool ways too by being so vocal. 

This shit sucks and it‚Äôs soooo much worse when you don‚Äôt know what to expect. I have half a mind to become a sex-Ed teacher so I can teach about meno right after teaching about puberty!!! It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable that most of us think meno is just A hot flash here, hot flash there, and no more periods. So much fucking more than that, so much fucking worse.

End rant!"
10vkznh,"It sounds like your mental health professional is giving you good support and advice. Hang in there, you are not alone."
10vkznh,"I used a slot in one of our team meetings to talk about it. I shared symptoms, impacts on individuals and relationships and the fact that GP‚Äôs in the UK have very little training. Nearly all (apart from 1or 2 middle aged or older women) even knew how bad it can get or how long it lasts. Shocking as it impacts on more than just us"
10vkznh,"I feel like all I do is talk about it. It's such a huge thing. The sentence I always start with is that the mental and emotional symptoms were the most surprising and the hardest to deal with. I'd heard of hot flashes but I didn't know about the anxiety. I'd heard of dry vaginas but I didn't have any idea about the severity of brain fog or the extreme rage or the lack of patience. I also had no idea that it can make things like ADHD symptoms much worse. 

HRT saved me, it saved my life. But I'm not who I was before my early menopause and I'm slowly coming to terms with the idea that I'll never be her again."
10vkznh,"What I see is that people aren‚Äôt realizing their symptoms are coming from peri or menopause. What we‚Äôre taught that meno is is hot flashes, vaginal dryness, maybe some extra don‚Äôt give a fuck in general attitude. But as we know the symptoms are actually so odd and widespread and seemingly unrelated to gyno issues on the surface. So women are experiencing these things, sure, but they and their doctors aren‚Äôt connecting the dots. The think they have developed various other mental and physical health convictions. I‚Äôm in my mid 40s and hearing friends remark on new anxiety disorders, suddenly high cholesterol, heart palpitations, sudden complete inability to control their weight no matter what they do, weird and scary adrenaline surges‚Ä¶all kinds of symptoms that are actually common in women approaching menopause, but somehow these dots aren‚Äôt yet vetted connected. 

I‚Äôve had friend tell me peri has been fine for them, no big deal, hot flashes are okay, what‚Äôs the big deal about it? Unrelatedly though, I have had a couple of ‚Äúunrelated‚Äù issues pop up recently‚Ä¶and when they say what they are, they‚Äôre all side effects of peri or meno. 

I wonder if part of it is hist denial by some women, just not wanting to be associated with menopause. It gives old and sexually undesirable and that‚Äôs not generally a category women wish to enter, especially if they‚Äôre 40 and still considered attractive to society.  Menopause has been associated with grandmother types, but now many of the ones experiencing it are younger, or feel themselves younger, than that dominant image. 

I have been glad to see more celebrities out there lately who are more youthful and thriving in the prime of their life who are also talking about approaching the change. I hope this will allow more women to be able to see themselves in this big tent."
10vkznh,I think Gen X is finally saying enough is enough with the suffering in silence - and can we get some help here please?!?
10vkznh,"I was mis-diagnosed as bipolar, put on heavy meds and was literally told I was crazy and wasn't putting in the work.  Fuck them.  Three days on hrt and all of my crazy was gone.  Again, fuck the multiple doctors that put this shit on me instead of properly treating me.  Did I mention that this led to my marriage being destroyed and possibly losing my career?  But I'm just a bitter woman for not staying in line and accepting my crazy."
10vkznh,Is common to be misdiagnosed as mental illness.
10vkznh,"I‚Äôm 48 years old. I didn‚Äôt have a period for 5 months and then had spotting every day for a month. I struggle with my weight a lot. I have insomnia and migraines sometimes. My sex drive is pretty low. My doctor has not said much. I have not experienced severe emotional  or mental health episodes. I‚Äôm not that bad off compared to what I often see posted here.

I don‚Äôt know what to say or ask other women."
10vkznh,"I can relate. I'm feeling blindsided by all of this coming on, with no prior knowledge of what i might experience. I only realized last week the strange ways I've been feeling might be peri meno, so I googled all weekend and learned a lot!"
10vkznh,"I feel like I talk about nothing else besides menopause these days! I swear if there is a soul who has spoken to me since 2020 they've gotten an earful about menopause, estrogen and testosterone (I don't mention progesterone, it's basically the Jan Brady hormone). My loved ones are lucky that I only yammer about vaginal atrophy once for every ten mentions of menopause. 

I have a newish guy in my life since 2020 and I tell him about my body, hormones, ideas for my ideal menopause clinic, thoughts about my new lack of giving a fuck socially, ideas for ways I can take advantage of my new state of mind to better the world (or at least my own little tiny neighborhood). I don't want to be ashamed of this because it's legitimately normal!!! 

Anyway, I'm sorry you're going through the wringer and I hope you get your levels sorted out so you can have some peace. I wish someone had talked to you about this sooner. The doc who said meno should be 'easy' for you is probably the same kind of doc who insists you have no nerve endings in your cervix so couldn't possibly feel the wire brush he's abrading you with nor do you need any numbing for inserting IUDs!"
10vkznh,"The doctor told you sudden menopause following hysterectomy ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be so bad‚Äù???! That makes me FURIOUS on your behalf! 

I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. The emotional, mental and physical trauma of being medically mistreated is very real.

Many of us are talking more and more openly about the challenges and struggles of menopause. 

We even have optional sessions on it at work from endocrinologists and scientists, and I shared my personal story with my team. Most of my team are younger than me and some of them are men, so it‚Äôs only theoretical / abstract for them at this point, but two women emailed me to thank me for opening the discussion - one nearly in tears because she‚Äôs going through it herself and thought she was losing her mind, and the other (in her 20s) saying ‚Äúnow I understand what my Mum went through‚Äù. 

The more we all talk about it, the better for all of us."
10vkznh,"Started peri probably in my mid 30s drs repeatedly wouldn‚Äôt give me any treatment for the various symptoms that were obviously menopause - unexplained aches - ibuprofen Rheumetology, night sweats whatever, depression  ssri, couldn‚Äôt sleep breathing exercises. Hot flashes brain not working  - when I broached the topic or mht they are quick to say but you don‚Äôt want to be on that forever. I was barely 40 no more ovulations at all. Like what are you talking about? As it happens to my friends they think they are allergic to mold chronic likes long covid and I‚Äôm like have you tried estrogen/progesterone? (I love progesterone it helps me sleep) I shout about menopause but yes in general nobody who is q medical provider checks us!"
10vkznh,"Why do so few talk about how wildly varying people's experiences can be? I'm in peri, and as such have recently found good info on r/Periods, and our younger sisters ARE talking about this stuff, but we still have so far to go.

For instance, I didn't know, at 53, that decidual casts had a name (honorable mention to whoever posted about birthing giant baby jellyfish, though). These little gems of the estrogen ocean are far from rare in my experience, at least over the past 15 months or so. Hell, I've birthed a couple of em today (though 4+ hasn't been uncommon)

I'm trying to sort through who has what to gain by keeping the truth, albeit very varied, hushed up. And before it's suggested, the ER and the damned doctor doesn't know any more than I do about my body. Or rather, if the establishment has any effective solutions, they have been wholly unwilling to fork em on over so I can see if they work for me. 

Absolutely, this stuff needs to be documented, thank goodness we have this space in which to do so"
10vkznh,Now that I‚Äôm dealing with perimenopause I tell everyone my age (or a few year behind) all the things I was never told.
10vkznh,"I don‚Äôt know, but I feel like men are somehow to blame for it."
10vkznh,"I have a pretty big circle between work and kids sports and friends and I have seen women I‚Äôve 
known for years crumble and they have no idea what is happening to them."
10vkznh,I don‚Äôt care anymore. I bring it up to women all the time‚Ä¶ and many seem relieved and relate! Reactions have been pretty priceless.
10vkznh,"I am so sorry you are so badly off! Really it is a screaming outrage how neglected we are.

I had a hysterectomy 9 years ago. They left my ovaries and cervix (I am so annoyed now about the last part as it means I cannot try estrogen only).

They also told me it wouldn‚Äôt affect my hormones since I still had ovaries. Hmmmmmmm‚Ä¶.

About 2 years later, it started with the dry skin, the joint pains. I had no idea this could be related to declining estrogen. It became worse and worse and I went to a rheumatologist etc‚Ä¶no help. Then my blood lipids became bad for no reason, the;blood sugar also for no aooarent reason, then some dizziness, then it started with some but still manageable anxiety‚Ä¶

And a year ago my mental health absolutely tanked, like yours. And when I say it went down, it really went down. I wake up several times every night (on the better nights, or I will just not be able to sleep more than two, three hours) and will be intensely anxious, filled with dread. Existential anxiety, too, so I cannot tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in the head‚Äù because I am dreading facts, only before I could sleep and live anyway.

And ofc I tried to get relief. And the psych docs are just as clueless for me as they seem to be for you. I got a lot of diagnoses, among them generalized anxiety, panic disorder, major depression, possibly bipolar‚Ä¶.and I am not sure any of these really are true. What about menopause? What about estrogen deficiency? Does this not cause such symptoms? No doctor seems to even consider this.I am told tests are useless, so I have no way to gauge if I am deficient in estrogen or have too much or ‚Ä¶. I am told estrogen deficiency can and does cause this anxiety and insomnia and I am told too much estrogen can also cause anxiety. So I am left swimming with no research.

Sadly the antidepressants didn‚Äôt work for me, made it worse on the contrary. Also not worked have several other strategies like melatonin, magnesium, breathing, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, tapping‚Ä¶I paid so much to snake oil sellers and I don‚Äôt have the money, I now cannot go on vacation like planned (not that it would be good with no sleep).

I feel left on the wayside with a horrible state of mind. I was told twice now this is my new normal ‚Äúbecause menopause doesn‚Äôt get better‚Äù. I hope this isnt true because it would mean a short and horrible time left for me, no body and mind can take this level of stress for long.

Sorry for going on about me I guess I just wanted to show you are not the only one also it‚Äôs 2am and I am awake since midnight with anxiety So I am prone to reaching out with my pain.

Oh, and yes I also lost 15kg since this started. I woul really really rather have kept them if that meaned I can sleep through nights and anxiety stops,"
10vkznh,Have you considered  HRT? This made a huge difference my mental health
10vkznh,I understand how you feel I was blindsided also with menopause.Mines started after Covid mess with my menstruation after one year of no period and then boom I was physically and mentally messed up.Im on HRT I'm not 100 percent better but I have a notice a difference since I been on the Combipatch for 2weeks.Hoping this continues to work cause menopause mentally and physically drain you.
10vkznh,"I‚Äôve been to that place you describe and it sounds like you need some estrogen. You probably wouldn‚Äôt need all those other meds if you just had some estrogen. 

My estrogen was completely depleted for months by the time I was able to start HRT. My extreme full-body hot flashes literally never stopped all day and all night so I was severely sleep deprived on top of the sickness caused by the  hormonal disaster that took over my body. I wanted to die no joke. 

I know every body is different and it‚Äôs not for everyone but HRT changed my life, brought me back to my regular functioning self. 

And I came out on the other side of that deep dark hell with no fucks left to give. Now I live my life just how I want, without apologies or fear of judgement. It‚Äôs quite liberating. 

Sorry for going on and on but it‚Äôs all to say, I hope you find relief by whatever means possible. I know you‚Äôve earned it. Hang in there!"
10vkznh,"There was just a huge article in the New York times about this.

https://nytimesineducation.com/women-have-been-misled-about-menopause/"
10vkznh,I‚Äôm asking to go see a menopause clinic! I‚Äôm just sick of not having more options available to us! I dunno why but today I felt like I was given the ending of my life being told I‚Äôm going into menopause
10vkznh,"I don't get it. I've mentioned meno-sy things around women friends my age, and they often act like meno probs is NEWS to them and no biggie."
10vkznh,I tell everyone about how awful menopause feels. But no one told me.
10vkznh,I truthfully think that med school is telling doctors not to engage on the subject. I‚Äôve tried to talk with several different doctors and they just blew me off despite me having so many of the classic symptoms
10vkznh,"I agree and thank you for this post. I couldn't get my doctor to tell me one thing about going through menopause. He reluctantly sent me to a gynecologist who took 3 months to book, I waited for an hour in her exam room, and all she gave me was a pamphlet and a pat on the shoulder. 

I had concerns about my mental health and how my menopause started. I had concerns that it was a false start menopause due to grief as my father unexpectantly passed and I never got my period after that. Also, I was confused about the mental health stuff because generally I'm not that anxious or depressed person. I mean I do get those things from time to time but what I was going through felt like the extreme levels of these emotions and it was often. 

I lost hair, my nails thinned, and for a small time the texture of my hair had changed which was really weird (about 10 months). I found through this site to grab some hair, nails, and skin vitamins that really really help. But again, the doctor wouldn't even give me that advise.

Honestly, I still don't know if what I'm doing is correct. I lurk in this group all the time and get some ideas. I do some research on the internet but that is honestly it. I try to walk every day and take some kick ass vitamins that make me feel great. From this group, I do realize that everyone's symptoms are all different.

Anyways, I hope that maybe your post will inspire some others to talk about it more and I would like to say that I'm extremely jealous that you lost weight but I'm glad you are here telling your story."
10vkznh,"Speaking of why are women not talking about‚Ä¶I just ‚Äúfound out‚Äù we should all be MOISTURIZING OUR VULVAS like our faces. 

We spend so much time and money moisturizing our faces and lips but no one ever told us we need to moisturize our üçëüçëüçë at least 3x a week. This is medically important stuff. We think we only need lube as our body ages but NO. We need moisturizers to keep our tissues supple and to prevent tears and gyno urologic issues like BV/UTI/YI. It‚Äôs imperative that we keep it juicy ‚Äî not for penetration‚Äî but for our urological health. 

Without moisture our vulva can literally shrivel up and die. Imagine your clitoris simply shrinks back into the body and stops working! We need to tell people these important facts about our changing bodies. I was surprised when the fabulous sexual health doctor at Sloane Kettering told me this. She was very graphic and informative. 

It‚Äôs amazing how much unconscious belief/bias/taboo we have about our vaginas. Like it‚Äôs our fault we experience dryness or that we must just grin and bear it. NO, it‚Äôs that people don‚Äôt talk about pussies. And mature ones especially. We should all be moisturizing them with hyaluronic acid gels and such (theres many made for this). 

It makes me so pumped to talk about this. I may have to start a company‚Ä¶anyone with me??"
10vkznh,"Doctors specializing in peri/meno are helping spread awareness and education on social media. Following them has given me confidence to talk about my own experiences and reference research that backs up my symptoms. I‚Äôve even schooled my own GP! Dr. Mary Claire Haver, for example, is really good at spotlighting the latest studies. I follow her on TikTok."
10vkznh,"I talk about it all the time, in some fairly inappropriate places. üòÜ 

But y'know, this is a thing that's happening to me and it affects how i move through the world so I have to talk about it!! Not as an excuse but as an explanation for Why I'm Like This. 

And hearing ""oh yeah, that happens to me all the time too"" is so helpful!! 

With doctors, I get right out in front of it. ""I'm 48, here's what I'm dealing with and how I deal with it, what can we do to make it easier?"" 

This is a crazy age and a crazy thing to have to go through!"
10vkznh,"I won't shut up about it, mainly because my friends and I are all equally outraged that we got here only to realize no one warned us and our doctors are only sometimes useful about it. Gen X - lets be the last generation that is surprised and unprepared for menopause!"
10vkznh,"You are not alone. Healthcare providers are not any better in the USA. I also feel like a one woman parade banging the drum about menopause to anyone who crosses my path. 

We talk about little else here, we validate each other and we discuss all topics that have the rippling effects of our experience. 

I would like to know how you and the other poster lost 40 and 15 pounds respectively! I'd be happy to give you some that I found. LOLOL"
10vkznh,I could not agree with this more!!! I went through the SAME thing. It pisses me off no one talks about it. Luckily my therapist recognized it as perimenopause  and so my OB put me on progesterone. Complete 180!! Really hope you get some relief soon!
10vkznh,"I talk about it.  I am a therapist.  I typically work with teens but I do some times have adult clients.  Both the women I have had lately were in menopause and didn‚Äôt know it.  They are very resistant to acknowledging it.  Which I find odd / not odd.  It‚Äôs such a dreaded thing ,, almost like you‚Äôre saying ‚Äòend of life‚Äô or something.  I suggest they get their hormones tested, think about HRT or whatever their doctor might suggest and we work on our feelings and allllllll the stuff that comes with it.  I‚Äôm through it, I had it early with a hysterectomy but ultimately in the end I think they are relieved to know what is going on.  And it won‚Äôt last forever, cuz it doesn‚Äôt.  Adjusting to the ‚Äònew you‚Äô is hard.  But we work on it."
10vkznh,"Well, my mom died before I entered menopause. Still not there, and it‚Äôs gonna be induced artificially since I have to have a hysterectomy. I think that‚Äôs the biggest reason why it‚Äôs not talked about. For many of us, by the time we reach that age, our mothers are gone. I wish mine was still here to advise me on what she went through. One tip for everyone: if you‚Äôre having abnormal bleeding in your above, the age of 45, don‚Äôt wait it out like I did. Go to the doctor right away."
10vkznh,"I just turned 50.

I'm only in perimenopause, but because I'm also oin autistic burnout with Long Covid it's hell.

Every month I have 1-3 weeks of cold/flu symptoms, increased mutism and meltdowns, circulation problems in my hands and feet, hellish itching, earache.

Plus the chronic dry skin and eyes, fatigue, insomnia, high blood pressure, chemical sensitivity, and muscle pain.

I'm going from doctor to doctor asking for help. Either I get told to rest, or told I'm making it up and/or am oversensitive. An orthopedist told me a couple of weeks ago that my foot pain is ""in my head.""

My friends and sister are starting to talk about it, but no one else does."
10vkznh,"Hormones play such a big role in how we feel.
I had kids at 38, so then had postpartum depression that morphed into menopause fairly quickly. Hardly any help from my family or health care community."
10vkznh,"Why are we not talking about it? Maybe the stigma.  I am 47 so I'm younger than the average, and many of my friends are yet to experience the symptoms or go through it. When I bring it up in conversation with them, they get visibly uncomfortable around the subject.  We have society to blame for that, but we can do better, and we can change it by being more open about it."
10vkznh,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you & I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre now getting help.HRT literally saved my life,I had no idea peri was even a thing so had no idea what was happening to me,suicidal,anxiety feeling of doom plus lots of other symptoms.

Luckily now it is being talked about more however e there still isn‚Äôt much scientific research on women‚Äôs  health it‚Äôs a disgrace.Like the between hormones adhd pmdd etc.

I was just thinking about the poor women who probably just got put in asylums due to suffering in peri/menopause with their mental health only a couple of decades ago! 

I hope you start to feel better soon.‚ù§Ô∏è"
10vkznh,"I read this and get furious at the thought of some male doctor telling you, after a drastic life changing surgery, that menopause won‚Äôt be a big deal.  What a dick."
10vkznh,I think it was the woman who founded mySysters who actually went to therapy for hypochondria because for TEN YEARS doctors told her the menopause symptoms she was having were all in her head. Then she quit her job in 2016 and developed the app to track her symptoms because SHE needed it and no one else was doing a damn thing about it! We don't seem to have gotten very far!!
10vkznh,"I‚Äôm guessing women don‚Äôt talk about it for the same reason they used to not talk about rape ‚Äî because people act like it is  a source of shame and lowers our value üôÑüôÑüôÑ.

That‚Äôs a seriously old ridiculous culture thing that needs to be deleted now. 

Talk about it! Also talk about rape if it‚Äôs happened to you because a lot of people seem to think it doesn‚Äôt happen nearly as often as it truly does.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIf you talk about it you‚Äôll also put the blame and shame where it actually belongs ‚Äî not on you."
10vkznh,"Im 49 and in peri for sure. My Dad passed in July last year and this coincided with missed periods. At first, I thought it was grief but then started researching and have come to the conclusion it's not. Prior to his passing, my periods were like clockwork, however I recognise I may have started having symptoms long before.

My sex drive has tanked and would rather stab someone in the eye. I oscillate between rage and depression. It's now affecting my sleep, I wake a lot easier than I used to. And the day fatigue.....If I could sleep for most of the day I would!

The most surprising symptom is bloating with constipation, wtf? I feel like someone has pumped gas into my gut. I wake up feeling swollen all over, including my hands and eyelids! Despite halving my body weight a decade ago, I feel like a fat blimp! Any my boobs are bigger and sore constantly. Its like being pregnant!

Im off for blood tests and will push for patches."
10vkznh,"This was almost my exact experience. I‚Äôm 59 now & I think I‚Äôm through the worst of it. Keep moving, take hormones, acupuncture helps, estroven helps."
10vkznh,I‚Äôm going through surgically induced menopause at 36. I literally thought I was going crazy the first 3/4 months. It‚Äôs calmed way down now. The night sweats sucked for a while too. Those aren‚Äôt as bad anymore.
10vkznh,"I think the reason is the same as the way talking about periods was for me. Mine were terrible, several days each month, and very uncomfortable. When I turned 40, mine got much worse. For the most part, if I mentioned it to a girlfriend, I heard about how their periods were 1-2 days with very little bleeding. So I think just the range of experiences makes it difficult."
10vkznh,"Ovarian failure after hysterecromy is super common. I went through this. The Climara estradiol patch saved my life. Find a new doctor to get HRT. I had the same mental/ mood symptoms as you.

Luckily, my surgeon let me know reduced ovarian function or failure was a possibility after surgery. It did happen. It was awful until I understood what was happening. Luckily, since you don't have a uterus you can take estradiol without progesterone probably."
10vkznh,"I agreem we need to talk about these things. One of my friends talked to me about it, she started young and she told me all about perimenopause which I thought was a bit of a myth. It‚Äôs not! She sent me things to read, I joined this sub. And I‚Äôm going to see a menopause clinic soon. I still have periods and my family members all went though it it at 52-53 so I thought I still have 3-4 years but nope, perimenopause is likely causing some issues for me. They aren‚Äôt as bad as for other women, but they might very well be from peri. 

And I talk to other women about it too now. My mum‚Äôs generation was better, they all talked about it, which was good for them, but also me, because I heard the stories from them"
10vkznh,"I had a bought of pelvic prolapse that took me fully by surprise. 

Mom: I told you not to lift heavy things!!

Me: You told me I would hurt my back not that my uterus would fall out!!!

Mom: Well it runs in our family

Me: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
10vkznh,I like to think that we will make it better for the future generations.
10vkznh,I talked about it in front of a class of law students during pre-lecture chit chat. I was pleasantly surprised when no one expressed horror or complained about me to administration.
10vkznh,"Bless you. I remember when my MIL had a hysterectomy and she was either in late 40s early 50s. The whole family felt like she lost her mind. It was so scary to see her change completely. I think she was miserable. Her sister had a hysterectomy when she was much younger due to health problems and I have no idea how she dealt/deals with it. My MIL has also had thyroid problems since and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the production of different hormones may have had an adverse effect on her personality and health. If you‚Äôve lost a lot of weight quickly, you may need to get your thyroid checked! I know it‚Äôs great at first but when you start wasting away it‚Äôs worrisome. She‚Äôs also not a very good patient and hasn‚Äôt done what her doctors have told her and had many health problems so it‚Äôs possible she didn‚Äôt do what was recommended after the surgeries. But any drastic change in your hormones will wreak havoc on you. You must have had something change to cause this. I hope you found someone that can continue to help you. It sounds like you‚Äôre on the right path. 
A different note, I have surprisingly been around several older women who have shared their experiences about menopause. I think a lot of it is that we don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. Then someone like you talks about it and it triggers a memory of certain issues. I don‚Äôt even know when my perimenopause symptoms began. I‚Äôm 43. Had a endometrial ablation at 37. I started noticing hot flashes around 41, thinking it was related to prediabetes. I‚Äôm overweight. Then I read about caffeine reactions and thought it was that. When I‚Äôd start sweating, several people were like ‚Äúcould it be menopause?‚Äù I thought they‚Äôre crazy but it fits. Since 37 my sex drive has gone through the roof down to the gutter and I‚Äôve been so exhausted and depressed. I‚Äôve been medicated for bipolar for 6 years so I thought it was that. My doc still has no concrete answer and just says it‚Äôs probably all those combined. It‚Äôs so frustrating. So I‚Äôm trying to lose weight. Can I take the ozempic shots? No! My A1C is too low. When can I get a break?! Good luck girl!"
10vkznh,"I agree, thank goodness you are taking about it! I am just turned 41, I have had hormone and thyroid issues since I was 13. Sadly unable to have kids, I have been menopausal for the last few years, am on an antidepressant and have tried everything possible to help with migraines, mood swings, chronic anxiety, sadness. I don‚Äôt have a history of mental illness and I know it is my hormones. Drs tell me I am too young. 
Well my period has decided to stop and without it I feel like a new woman - the old me, the old me who is not a lunatic. I know it will come back but if it doesn‚Äôt I will relish in the non hormonal shitshow that has become my life. Sending all of you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10vkznh,"My hormones triggered a manic/psychotic episode & I was hospitalised ~ got confused for mental illness then got diagnosed properly with menopausal symptoms as had PMDD my whole life & ovary plus two Fallopian tubes removed with surgery. Years of suffering w endometriosis. I feel you‚Ä¶keep strong sister, Do you feel emotional numbness & are unmotivated in life?!"
10vkznh,I‚Äôve been telling everyone I know starting w ‚Äúthis may TMI but you need to know this‚Ä¶.‚Äù
10vkznh,"Our culture is youth obsessed. Talking about menopause signals your age. No one wants that. Hell, if half the peeps here were okay with that, then they wouldn't be on HRT."
10vkznh,"I‚Äôm still having regular periods. I asked my doctor just today if he could check my hormones because my mental health has tanked. Similar to yours‚Ä¶ I actually wrote down on my question list if perimenopause could cause bipolar. My doctor was nice and handed me the tissues because tears started falling. He said there was no benefit to testing hormones on someone still menstruating since there is not a way to know what is normal and hormones fluctuate significantly throughout an average day.
But he did take blood to do some regular bloodwork. 
I wish there was an easy answer. He suspects depression and the lexapro I am on isn‚Äôt the right treatment ."
10vkznh,"*...and the doctor who did my surgery told me that menopause would not be so bad. He obviously didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about.*

Too bad you couldn't ask him how his menopause was. Oh wait, he has a penis, so he has NEVER had one. Grrr. Hang in there."
10vkznh,"My friend is in her mid-50s and has been dealing with hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings for the past several months. At first, she tried to ignore these symptoms and just push through, but they only seemed to get worse. She found herself feeling increasingly anxious and depressed, and even had trouble sleeping at night due to the hot flashes.  
  
  
  
One day, she confided in me about what she was going through and I could see how much it was affecting her quality of life. She felt like no one else understood what she was going through and that she was the only one experiencing these symptoms. It broke my heart to see her in so much distress.  
  
  
  
I encouraged her to see a doctor and to speak openly about her symptoms. It turns out, she was indeed going through menopause and her doctor was able to provide her with information and resources to help her cope. My friend was grateful for the education and support she received and was finally able to start taking control of her health and well-being.  
  
  
  
This story highlights the importance of talking about menopause and seeking help when we need it. No one should have to suffer in silence and feel ashamed of the symptoms they are experiencing.   
  
  
  
We can support each other and break the stigma surrounding menopause by sharing our experiences and educating others."
10vkznh,"Thank you to everyone and their comments. I‚Äôm 45 had my uterus taken out 5 years ago.  Was told menopause was a long way away.   Started having symptoms this year,  thought I was going crazy found out I‚Äôm post.   Symptoms are worse and I feel lost.  I don‚Äôt know who to talk to. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with body.  If this is menopause and I‚Äôm 45 how am I gonna get through decades of this?!?!"
10vkznh,"Thank you for being so brave you beautiful soul. I too am 50 years old. My menopause began a few years ago. I miss my moon. I also have mental health issues that I have to stay on top of also.. I had crazy hot flashes at first. Then I got terrible night sweats. I would have to get up and change my clothes in the middle of the night, sometimes twice a night. Finally I got on hormones. I have relief from the sweats and hot flashes. I am also still coping with the weight gain. Thank you so much again for your post. I hope that you feel seen and heard.ü•π"
10vkznh,"I'm so lucky where i work that we talk openly and give each other support, about 5 of us are the same about the same age and going through different stages of peri and menopause. I work in hospital (non clinical side) and the management have had menopausal workshops. Thankfully after 4 months of waiting my appointment with menopause clinic in Dublin Ireland is on Friday. I have never been so excited for a doctor's appointment. My GP was however was useless and brushed me off. Most of friends have found Irish GPs useless and uninterested to help."
10vkznh,I talk to my kids about this.  My mom was moody and never said anything to me.   I am not repeating that.
10vkznh,"I‚Äôm 48, and you just described my life for the past 4 years to a ‚ÄúT‚Äù until I started HRT 9-10 weeks ago. I was already on 3 meds for depression and anxiety (never had an MH problem prior to menopause). I was desperate. Luckily my GYN was gung-ho when I asked about HRT, and until I found this sub a couple months ago, I had no idea so many women face an uphill battle trying to find a provider who is willing to prescribe it. 

And as if finding someone to prescribe it isn‚Äôt hard enough, once you do, insurance coverage (or lack thereof) for what your doc actually wants to give you and what works best is a whole other battle! It‚Äôs one I‚Äôm facing now. I have to change policies in a month. I finally feel like a sane, not-raging, not-suicidal, actually living and functioning, hopeful human being again, and now I can‚Äôt find a single policy I can afford that will cover either my estradiol patch or progesterone capsule. Not some coverage with a higher copay‚ÄîNO coverage at all! They all cover birth control though (which are the same hormones in higher doses‚Äîmakes no sense) AND‚Äî*this is the part that really pisses me off*‚Äîthey all cover at least one form of medication for male erectile dysfunction. Somehow insurance companies think it‚Äôs important for a man to be able to have the option to fuck, but it‚Äôs not that important for women to have the option to have access to medications that literally preserve her physical health (thus potentially reducing the insurance companies‚Äô future costs‚Äîmorons), bolster mental health, and improve daily functioning overall. Thus, in the US, insurance companies are making sure women get fucked both literally and figuratively. 

I‚Äôve already started making a list of personal items I can sell to be able to afford my HRT out-of-pocket, because going back to the piece of crap person I felt like before it is not an option for me or for the well-being of my 8-year-old son (whom I‚Äôm convinced must be some sort of saint, because I have no idea how he doesn‚Äôt hate me after what I‚Äôve put him through for 4-years before starting HRT). My GYN insisted multiple times that HRT would do nothing to help my depression, rage or anxiety and said if those things do get a little better it would be indirectly due to getting better sleep if I‚Äôm not waking up from hot flashes. But I really do think HRT in and of itself has improved my mood, independent of sleep. I still wake up a lot due to chronic neuropathic pain that‚Äôs always worse at night (I actually never woke much due to hot flashes, mine were worse during the day), yet mood-wise I feel like a miracle happened. And fairly quickly, too; my mood seemed better within a week. HRT did help my energy and I started exercising again a few weeks ago, but my mood started improving before that. Obviously ‚Äúlife‚Äù still happens and my circumstances are far from great, but not flipping the heck out all the time feels awesome. 

As an aside, I ‚Äúpicked up‚Äù the 40 lbs of weight you ‚Äúdropped‚Äù during this crazy biological stage of life that no one ever warned me about. üòÇ But somehow, that doesn‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm the absolute ugliest, most disgusting person in the world now like it did before I started HRT. üòÉ I do want to reduce that number for health reasons, and for the first time in a long time, I feel like I actually have the ability to do that. Before finding supportive resources and people like this sub and the people who contribute to it and before HRT, I can‚Äôt say I felt that way at all.

Hang in there Women Warriors. We still have a lot of life to live, and we should all be given the chance to live it well."
10vkznh,"I have talked to several women who have gone through menopause and it was only when I mentioned how messed up I feel that they talked about their experiences. 

I had a hysterectomy 7 years ago, so no periods for me. Both sets of bloodwork that came back shows no estrogen. 

I am sticking in there and can‚Äôt wait till this is over."
10vkznh,"What kills me is I have several close friends who have gone through menopause and said a damn word, until I lost my crap. Why? Why are we not helping each other through this?

Thank goodness I found this thread. Wish I found it sooner."
10vkznh,"Me, too. Except some of them don't believe me or think that the weight gain can be deterred by a lot of exercise or something. They don't want to know about the symptoms."
10vkznh,"My mum talked about it when I was 20 or so, I am glad she did. Definitely is something that young women should know about. How to recognise perimenopause too. Because it can happen early sometimes and needs to be recognised. Sometimes it can happen in someone‚Äôs 20s!"
10vkznh,"You ain't wrong! Never ever did anyone say to me, ""Oh, by the way, you might damned nigh bleed to death and there are medications to prevent that, but if you're over 50 your doctor won't give them to you and since you're American you can't get them OTC in the land of the free, but you won't be in any shape to travel because of the anemia you'll have because you can't get any meds to stop it, so just pay for a hysterectomy instead, they're a safe and effective treatment for low progesterone, wink wink"" üôÑ"
10vkznh,Amen
10vkznh,"I think anyone who‚Äôs been on Reddit one hot minute knows how messed up healthcare is in the US. 

Love! Love! The idea of talking to my coworkers about it. I work in a woman dominated field, of all ages, this would be great to share. Thanks!"
10vkznh,I‚Äôd love it if you posted the info you used to talk about it.
10vkznh,What hrt are you taking and how did you get them to prescribe it? I'm going to switch doctors if mine does not start taking me seriously.
10vkznh,"I'd been having some weirdo symptoms that had me 3am-googling at one point, just happened to choose the right words to land on a message board about peri elsewhere where I saw other people connecting this particular dot and then found a laundry list there that blew my mind! So many other health things I'd been dealing with finally made sense in that context. I was so lucky to have a GP who was a little puzzled but listened to me and referred me to an endo who was similarly not familiar with my particular top issue, but said hey, lets try hormones and see. I'd be even more of a mess if I hadn't gone that route. 

Still learning more by the day, but also increasingly annoyed at how there seems to have been no effort to popularize these \*really significant\* details so many of us are obviously dealing with. I brought it up in a chat on an unrelated topic the other day because I figure time to be the change, maybe help some others while I'm at it. Though I do get the denial piece under the circumstances; time for us to contribute to reframing."
10vkznh,"At this point we have to stop suffering in silence. My body is broken from suffering is silence. Two back surgeries, messed up shoulder, radiation treatment for my thyroid, bursitis in both hips, am I live with chronic pain, all the time, and now menopause. yeah‚Ä¶."
10vkznh,This right here is why so many women ended up in institutions years ago.
10vkznh,Not alone‚ù§Ô∏è
10vkznh,Out of interest why not talk about progesteron?
10vkznh,So what are you doing about the vaginal atrophy? Have you found a way to have sex without feeling like your vagina is on fire? This solution is my vision quest.
10vkznh,Id like to hear more about your ideal menopause clinic. Maybe a new post about that so we can all chime in?

10vkznh,"I feel the same way as so many of you on here. I dont think I can take years of this, and doctors don't want to do anything about it. I asked my gyno for hormone testing and she said no. I am trying everything I can, ordering my own blood tests, wasting money on natural things and nothing helps. I struggle to get through each day with vision, dizziness, and other issues. This is such b.s."
10vkznh,"I think as long as you have no uterus, you can do estrogen only."
10vkznh,"So it sounds like you haven‚Äôt tried hormone therapy yet [although not for lack of asking]? 

Have you considered going through an online Telehealth company‚Äîlike Alloy, Geneva, Midi, and I know there are more [I haven‚Äôt used any yet], since you‚Äôre being denied through more traditional avenues? 

Also: I had everything taken out but my ovaries, including my cervix, in a hysterectomy in 2018 due to a suspicious fibroid scare in a bad spot. Because my surgeon told me that hormonally, I would be ‚Äúexactly the same‚Äù after the surgery, I believed him. And wowwww, was I confused when my mental / emotional health started unraveling about 4 weeks later. I‚Äôve periodically struggled with it since; the last year being the hardest / longest that I was definitely NOT okay. 

Out-of-the-blue insomnia + ensuing, spiraling, life-sucking anxiety have been my primary symptoms, just like you. 

Fortunately, I already take an SSRI, so slowly adjusting my dose up with a hands-on psychiatrist to better combat anxiety eventually helped, plus taking a legit sleep aid for a year that I‚Äôm now weaning off of, PLUS therapy, PLUS daily exercise, PLUS a year-plus of no drinking PLUS acupuncture with a female specialist in hormonal health have actually helped me maintain a semblance of mostly normal. But it took 9+ months of troubleshooting.

I know that I will be tripped up by more hormonal dips / plummets / spikes in the near future, because perimenopause always eventually becomes menopause, and I will have zero hesitation advocating hard for estrogen + maybe even progesterone if I need it. 

I would encourage you to keep trying on this front, although I know we‚Äôll how damn hard / debilitating these two primary symptoms together are. Those are times I wouldn‚Äôt wish on ANYONE."
10vkznh,"I am on HRT still feel (no offense meant to others struggling with mental health) bat-sh!t crazy. 

Thing are getting better with the medication I am now on but it still sucks."
10vkznh,"So when I got sick last April I had every single symptom of Covid19 and because my home test said I was negative the doctors refused to test me for Covid or the antibodies. 

It was right after I finally got better with whatever I was sick with, when things got really bad. 

Glad your meds are helping."
10vkznh,Thank you for this!
10vkznh,"Yeah, I see a combo of, ‚Äúnot a problem for me‚Äù and ‚Äúoh, not me yet.‚Äù  

Some of it is possibly aging denial."
10vkznh,I been thinking the same thing!
10vkznh,Me too. Mostly bc I don‚Äôt want other women to be as shocked as I am
10vkznh,Wellbutrin and Lexapro. Some days I struggle just to eat. Thank goodness I can buy medical marijuana or I would be absolutely hosed. That 40lbs came off in less then 5 months. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I can and am lose another 20-25lbs but what happens after that? The answer I get is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10vkznh,"I believe I was thinking these words as you typed. Twins? I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôd lost weight at any point in the years before the culprit, menopause occurred to me. The unexplained weight gain and inability to lose it pushed me to realize what has been tripping me up in SO many other areas."
10vkznh,Can you take JUST progesterone? And which of these terrors does that help -if taken alone? Thanks
10vkznh,"Do you sometimes feel like your foot pain needs to be in your your doctor‚Äôs head?

(In other words ‚Äúain‚Äôt that a kick in the head?)"
10vkznh,Did they put you on HRT?
10vkznh,Omg! That was one of my nightmares..
10vkznh,"I had no signs. Got a bad respiratory/sinus infection last April, took 2 months to get over it only to be in full blown menopause. 

I honestly feel like I am losing my mind. Now I know what being manic and so depressed i barely was able to get out of bed, is like. 

Fortunately I work from home, otherwise I would not been able to keep my job. My friends and family have been very supportive, but I don‚Äôt want to be a burden. 

Now I have a mental health professional, a counselor and I am still looking for a good doctor. It is so frustrating that there is so little information."
10vkznh,Same!
10vkznh,"Yes, yes, yes! What you have wrote definitely sounds what I am going through, including the insurance refusing to pay for the safer HRT. 

To be honest my insurance sucks. One of my very good friends has the same insurance and she is dying from cancer because insurance refused to pay for the treatment for her type of cancer. They would only paid for the medication that was 60% effective, she fell in the 40% category. Our healthcare system lets us all down."
10vkznh,"I also had the same Op and same time, what smarts more is that my surgeon was a female in her fifties. No warning at all. 

Was misdiagnosed as bi polar, put on loads of different meds, work was impossible, so had to be signed off sick. 

Then, of course made redundant..

Then I started to self medicate with wine, got help for that..erm you are bi polar‚Ä¶üò°

No!!! I am post menopause and going insane!!!

Finally found a great GP in UK and got HRT and small dose of anti depressants 

Relationship with my partner is falling apart because he doesn‚Äôt get it.

Now I understand the horror stories I used to hear about my grandmother staying in bed for days."
10vkznh,That makes sense that you would be feeling the way you were without any estrogen! I'm so glad your Dr ordered your blood work to find this out. I went on Lupron for only 2 months during chemo (it's the same thing they give as chemical castration) and it sucks all of your hormones out of you and I was so depressed and sad and the world was bleak so I discontinued taking it against the wishes of my drs (but now I find myself in early menopause). But it taught me how important hormones are for mental health. I hope getting on hrt is helping you feel better!!
10vkznh,"Did you have a full hysterectomy, ovaries out too? I had an oopherectomy in my early 40‚Äôs because of‚Ä¶it‚Äôs complicated‚Ä¶and I was told I would become menopausal very abruptly which I blithely brushed off because ‚Äúyeah yeah, a few hot flashes, I get it‚Äù. HA! Major hot flashes, warm all the time, weight gain and a complete loss of libido. I really wish I had understood more about what losing my ovaries would mean. I go back and forth as to whether I would still have opted to have them removed, but the ability to make a more informed decision would have been nice."
10vkznh,"I hear this!  My best friend hardly wants to talk about it.  It's like, wtf ladies?

No older female relatives ever talked about it, other than my mother offhandedly mentioning once that she had her period for a month."
10vkznh,Second!
10vkznh,Do.  Don‚Äôt suffer.  I had a nurse practitioner utterly ignore me and my symptoms for 2 years.  She always had to one up me.  Getting another doc was the only way around her.
10vkznh,"Switch now if your doc is pissing about. 

I'm on estrogen gel (rub on thighs), progesterone pill (take every 2 weeks), estrogen cream (insert like a tampon) and testosterone cream (rub on bum). It's honestly a bit of a saga to take them all but my dosage is a little high so it's better to take it dermally than ingest it."
10vkznh,"Yeh - I see my 80 something year old mum who lives with chronic pain and can feel myself now on that same slippery slope as I go into peri and I‚Äôm like - that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going to do something about this! I do hope you can find some relief x"
10vkznh,Fucking thank you.  This right here.  We've been thrown out and told us it's our fault.
10vkznh,"YES!!  I was in the same state.  A np put me on progesterone only and it literally saved my life.  Multiple gynos keep prescribing me lexapro and thank god I didn‚Äôt go on it.  If your having mental health issues then yes.  But if you never did before it‚Äôs probably the hormones plus hormonal anxiety is different and anti anxiety meds might not work for that.  It does annoy me that progesterone only is not talked about enough, it really helps some of us."
10vkznh,I was curious ab that too bc progesterone has been a literal lifesaver for me
10vkznh,Because I don't have any opinion on it! :)
10vkznh,"My coochee nana almost jumped out at that visual. 

I have a question, mind you this is coming a single woman going through menopause, but do you all even want sex? Because I absolutely no sex drive. 

I am pretty much asexual. Which for me is wonderful. I can‚Äôt imagine how much it would suck having a guy expecting sex while I feel like I want to die."
10vkznh,"There was someone on this subreddit who was a physical therapist, I believe for post birth and post cancer treatment issues, among other things.  They suggested an over the counter gel with hyaluronic acid in it.  I searched and found one and it has helped with the dryness, the painful sex and the itching (OMG, why does no one tell us about this?!???).  

Since it had been so long without sex (a very patient, understanding, loving husband, who is also happy to forego PIV sex), I got dialators and vitamin E inserts, too.  The hyaluronic gel, vitamin E suppositories, and dialators have been pretty effective. I am back to about 90-99% normal, depending on the day.  A very good lube is needed, too.  I don‚Äôt know if we can talk brand names, but the hyaluronic gel was gynatrof, the lube we have used is uberlube.

I have so far been unsuccessful getting a prescription for anything hormone related, so no HRT.  Can someone tell us what we could say to the docs to get an HRT prescription?  It feels like that is an insurmountable mountain to climb.  Maybe my sex drive would bounce back with some real hormones.  And maybe I wouldn‚Äôt occasionally feel like murder or suicide.  I never was told how freaking rage-y I might feel!"
10vkznh,Vaginal estrogen in addition HRT. It takes a long time and patience to get things back to a level of day to day comfort but it does work. I've tried every iteration of cream and suppositories and the cream works best for me but I need to use it more frequently than they usually suggest.
10vkznh,"Hi, it‚Äôs when the entire uterine lining is shed as one piece. 
This link probably explains better than I can. 

https://www.healthline.com/health/womens-health/decidual-cast"
10vkznh,"Oversimplification, but it's when the uterine lining sheds as one blob. They're shaped like the uterus"
10vkznh,"Men go through male menopause, called andropause."
10vkznh,"Yes, you can take estrogen if you have no uterus. My doctor put me on estrogen only for now. 6 months more bloodwork.. yeah‚Ä¶ü´§"
10vkznh,"I am on HRT, the estrogen dose may be too low still though. I am on 2 pumps of gel plus 200mg progesterone daily. It is very challenging to find someone to go behond the standard dose.

Yes those two symptom, just like you,  pare the absolute worst!! Really horrible. I was a bit luckier than you, I didn‚Äôt really tank until now but slip more slowly until it got to that point where the mental health symptoms reared their ugly head.

I have the awful feeling it willbe impossible for me to get through this when SSRI and SNRI don‚Äôt work for meand they inly made the anxiety so much worse‚Ä¶even after five weeks

When perimenopause becomes menopause at least the level will be stable. Then it is easier to find the right dose, the right treatment. With those wildly fluctuating levels I am going nuts

And yes. I also wouldnt wish this crushing anxiety plus insomnia to give you many hours to reallyfeel your fears, I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone either

I feel cheated out of my life. It could be so good now!"
10vkznh,By the way what sleep aid did you take?
10vkznh,"I was on HRT but didn't realize at the time that the dose might need to be adjusted over time. I started to have horrible mental health issues, crippling panic attacks and anxiety. I thought I was losing my mind. My blood work looked "" low normal"" so I never mentioned it to my gyn. I had NO idea that low estrogen could cause mental health issues.

I finally went to him sobbing, what is WRONG with me.....
He adjusted my does up and in a week I felt 90 % better. It's worth considering."
10vkznh,I‚Äôm doing better since I‚Äôve backed off HRT. But i‚Äôm still 40 heavier and counting.
10vkznh,Right? I'm the first woman in my maternal line (currently living) who is experiencing natural menopause. All the other women in my lineage have had hysterectomies or other things that precluded natural menopause so I don't even really have anyone to ask!
10vkznh,"I have been on both of those, but can't remember if they were at the same time. Nevertheless,  I sure didn't lose any weight on either. It's gotta be the Medical Marijuana. 

I wonder what made you so sick. I had a gyno tell me "" YOU are having a beautiful menopause!""  If I had half the cajones then that I have now I would have slapped him upside the head.

Wish I had more of an answer for you."
10vkznh,"Dear Sister:  I so relate. This has changed me so much. All the effort that I put into being fit in the years prior to menopause seems wasted. Looking up diet and exercise for our population proves that both have minimal effects on us. Wtf? I was blindsided by focusing on my depression so much that I didn't even give a thought to peri-menopause until I was postmenopause. 

Now I find that I may be also ADHD? Great. Who the f is going to help me with all this crap? Aside from all this, I just also found out that I have a large hiatal hernia attached to a tortuous esophagus. I think this has been going in since my pregnancy at 43. Talk about screwed up hormones."
10vkznh,I started on progesterone only to stop heavy periods.  I figure that's fine as long as I'm still having periods.  Keeping an eye out for when I need to add system estrogen.
10vkznh,"Yes, and I even tried to call him and tell him what I thought about his treatment of me, because he was very arrogant. But he suddenly doesn't do telephoe consultation. üôÑ

My physician wisely told me to pick my battles, and requested x-rays and diagnosis from the other orthopedist who at least diagnosed arthritis and fallen arches.

And that doesn't even address the cardiologic stuff. 

Up until Nov 2021, I was fit and healthy."
10vkznh,I am not on any HRT. They told me I could decide if I wanted it or not. And if I wanted it later that would be no issue.
10vkznh,Luckily a whole bunch of pelvic exorcise cleared it up (it wasn‚Äôt a severe case). But had I known I could have easily been doing  them before and never had the issue to begin with.
10vkznh,"Yes!! At least we have meds to help today but life is miserable!! How are we supposed to be successful at work going through this shit? I‚Äôm about to be single, for many other reasons than my behavior changes but I gotta fend for myself and I‚Äôm barely hanging on at work! I have lost a few pounds and trying to exercise regularly since new years and I am seriously feeling better but hell I can‚Äôt concentrate long enough to plan meals or plan ahead for anything. I hate feeling so brain dead."
10vkznh,"It is slowly for me, but, bloody hell it‚Äôs a process. Nobody warned me about this.

To me, before, menopause was just hot and cold flushes, the mental and other physical stuff was brushed under the carpet.

A ladies dirty secret‚Ä¶ along with menstruation. 

100 years and no progress"
10vkznh,Those drs who fail to fully explain consequences of the procedures should be held accountable.  I know they are busy but for one person that speaks out there are many more who don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt.  Congratulations on speaking up and thankyou as two fiends I‚Äôm supporting have also recently just had almost identical conversations with their own doctors prior to hysterectomy.  It should not be a retrospective google search or a discussion on reddit when they take ovaries.  It‚Äôs people‚Äôs lives that are left in complete ruin.  The doctors have no idea as we never see them or ever feedback the consequences of their actions.
10vkznh,No I just had my cervix and uterus removed.
10vkznh,Thank you
10vkznh,"Crazy aunt in the attic? Nahhhh.... she's just going thru The Change....

I shit you not....I thought I was losing my mind when my HRT needed adjusting. My poor hubs was following me around the house he was so worried. And going to work was a nightmare. I was a teacher, so no privacy for personal stuff there. All my crazy was out for everyone to see and comment on."
10vkznh,"I really envy the single ladies. If the atrophy doesn‚Äôt get to you, just feeling like a blob or a toad might be worse. I find I wish to be alone with my growing disappointments and depression and anxiety and and and."
10vkznh,"I had ZERO interest in sex, and was fine with that since I am single.  However, now that I am on hrt (estrogen AND testosterone) I am noticing more thoughts about sex, and it's still fine.  In fact, I think it's giving me a more positive outlook on life in general, like the world isn't such a bad place after all.  It sounds to me like you really, really need your hormones back.  They literally are life."
10vkznh,"Forty-nine years old, in early to mid-perimenopause.  Yes, I really do want sex.  Lots of it.  My husband is tired of me hounding him, and I'm tired of wasting all this beautiful sexual energy not getting F##ked.  But also, I do have some symptoms of atrophy, and use estradiol cream to keep everything juicy and plump and healthy"
10vkznh,"> I spent some time talking with a pelvic-floor physical therapist, and she suggested using it pretty much daily, but less than one ounce. I put a bean-sized squeeze on my finger and apply it that way."
10vkznh,"Yea, it‚Äôs why I added the link which explains it fully"
10vkznh,I have my cervix still so a bit of an uterus.
10vkznh,"I take generic Ambien + Trazodone. Last year, when I was in the worst of worst places, I took only Ambien \[10 mg, or two 5 mg pills\]. As I've weaned off of it slowly, slowly, sloooowly, I take mostly Trazodone. For me, Trazodone is generally helpful IF AND ONLY IF my central nervous system is consistently calm + only predictably activated. When I'm in those dark, anxiety-riddled corners, I need/needed the more serious strength stuff. It's just how it is. And both have been administered by a very diligent psychiatrist."
10vkznh,Wellbutrin caused me to lose a whole load of weight. Sadly I also lost a whole load of hair.
10vkznh,"Wow. Sorry about the hernia. To everything else, I can so relate. As the most modest person you‚Äôll ever meet, I would have gone on ‚Äúnaked and afraid‚Äù when I was 52. I was tough and proud ü•≤ (i honestly could NEVER. But it WAS an recurring  idea). 
I‚Äôm also -very obviously-A.D.D. 
Sis"
10vkznh,"at your age, the sooner the better, you are at risk of some serious bone loss, so you want to be informed about that before waiting too long."
10vkznh,"Our clitoral anatomy isn‚Äôt even in medical textbooks. This fact blew my mind when I learned this last year. We‚Äôve come so far, yet still in the Middle Ages. Lol no pun intended"
10vkznh,"This is how I felt about a tubal ligation. I had a c section later in life and thought it would be easier. I had no idea how shitty I would feel bc if it. But my mom, MIL and aunt all had them and told me about how terrible their periods were. None of us made the connection. No one told us. I found out after the fact doing a Google search! It‚Äôs bullshit. What‚Äôs even more ridiculous is you go to the doctor about any female problems and their first response is hysterectomy. Really?! Just cut it out. WTH?! Healthcare for women is messed up."
10vkznh,"I feel so sad for my poor mom.  I thought she was crazy and really mean.  I had no idea how hard it was for her.  She probably didn't know what was happening either.  

My 16yo daughter has been educated more than she would like now.  I also tell all of my friends and have gotten them turned on to myalloy.com.  hrt scripts without having to deal with arguing with multiple doctors who think I'm being ""silly""."
10vkznh,I alternate internal and external doses every other night
10vkznh,Thank you. I may have to resort to sleep aids. Unfortunately I have a very unfriendly psychiatrist who isn‚Äôt working woth me at all.
10vkznh,Hate that stuff. Gave me panic attacks.
10vkznh,Thanks‚ù£Ô∏è
10vkznh,"Absolutely crazy, I don‚Äôt what I would do without this sub. I would be scared, thinking I am going mad. My poor grandma, I really know she suffered."
10vkznh,It‚Äôs great for people who are suffering from depression but it isn‚Äôt great if you are bipolar because it can tip you over to a manic state.
10nec57,"I actually laugh when men get to that level of bewildered emotionality. Isn't it kind of funny imagining a dude being so unable to think of a response to an *etiquette post* that he would commit serious time to digging through someone's post history, only to come up with ""Oh YEAH? Well you...... you.... you have a dry vagina!""?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
10nec57,"Number one, ageism...so sick of it

Number two, as women, do we ever get to escape this shit? When we were younger, we got told we were on the rag/irrational every time a disagreement came up. ""Are you on your period?"" Now, it's dried up menopause. I'm so SICK of it"
10nec57,"Ugh that‚Äôs disgusting. This has happened to me in real  life. A male relative at Christmas looked at my kids and said ugh oh kids are getting old soon you‚Äôll hit menopause. I looked at him and said, is that a bad thing? (Mfucker)"
10nec57,"It‚Äôs so crazy to me how they think a vagina that no longer rolls out the wet welcome carpet for penises is an insult. Our bodies‚Äô disregard for them means we are no longer of value - to them. 

Am I the only one that sees the absurdity in this?"
10nec57,"It doesn't even make sense as an insult to me. It is like saying ""you have stayed alive many years and your body is absolutely normal."" It is like trying to insult someone by saying ""you have moderately dry skin in winter and breathe air."" I get that they are trying to be mean and rude but try harder."
10nec57,"Next time, tell him (& other such idiots) he clearly needs better training in debate if he‚Äôs stuping to use an ad hominem argument (attacking the person vs. the issue at hand) & that you‚Äôve no time for insincere redditors/people/trolls. Then report & block him. Like you alluded earlier in the feed, no need to feed the trolls :)"
10nec57,"The joke's on him. If he isn't already, someday *he* will be old with a flaccid penis. It's inevitable. Testosterone takes a dip after 30. And after 50 it's all love handles and manboobs from there. The more secure dudes out there just embrace it and try to live a healthy life. Insecure douchebags will bend over backwards to keep themselves ""young"". (These are the midlife crisis dudes.) For whom? Your guess is as good as mine. People with attitudes like the guy in your post end up alienating everyone in their lives and die alone. They basically need to be rich for anyone to give them a second glance. The ugly on the inside tends to match the ugly on the outside.

Sidenote: Calling people ""old"" is the dumbest insult because age happens to every single one of us. It's not this thing you can skip unless you ""*live fast -- die young and pretty.""*

lmao. ""OMG YOU'RE OLD!!""

Oh yeah? *You're* not getting any younger."
10nec57,"Do we need to go in and get him? ü§™

No it‚Äôs not ok. That‚Äôs a coward"
10nec57,"Men hate it when women get old and wise enough to see through their bullshit, and as usual, will respond by trying to make age and wisdom somehow bad and insulting. But we‚Äôre able to see through that, too, so it only underscores how hilariously, pathetically insecure and irrelevant they are. lmao"
10nec57,"That happened to me as well, on a skincare sub.

The guy kept riding me and I reported him, he eventually got suspended."
10nec57,"The same thing happens to me in the Baltimore City USA sub. I volunteer with at risk youth in the city and run a physical therapy practice, I see many victims of violent crime. Any time I criticize a specific local political wannabe her followers send me messages about being a dried up old menopausal bag. They call themselves ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù online, yet their behavior is so exclusionary. It‚Äôs not ok."
10nec57,"Here‚Äôs the thing- he thinks simple facts about your life are an insult because he‚Äôs bought into the patriarchal bullshit that says you should be ashamed to exist now. So what if someone is old, menopausal, with a dry vagina? I mean, seriously, there is nothing wrong with being any or all of those things. What‚Äôs an insult to them, does not need to be internalized that way by you. A simple response such as ‚ÄòAnd?‚Äô is good. Or just state the truth; ‚ÄòI see you no longer have anything helpful or valid to bring to this exchange so we are done here.‚Äô And then be done, no matter what they say. 

Fuck the people trying to make a person feel less than- I spent waaaaayyyyy too many years hearing men‚Äôs (and women‚Äôs) judgments on me and taking them to heart. When I finally figured out what people thought or said about me had *nothing* to do with me and *everything* to do with them, my life got easier. I stopped feeling the need to internalize other people‚Äôs trama that they were projecting onto me. That‚Äôs for them to work on. I can wish them good future mental heath in my head, feel bad they are dealing with so much toxicity that it would manifest in such an ugly way, and walk away content that I am doing the work on myself so that I don‚Äôt need to respond in kind, or at all."
10nec57,"Report him to the mods of that sub? Sometimes it's good to be a ""Karen."" Put him in his place."
10nec57,"I‚Äôm had someone do that too.. look at my profile and try to use my interests to humiliate me, mentioning menopause and makeup addiction and how I must be insecure. I find that so intrusive. But I just answered back if you were trying to embarrass me you didn‚Äôt dig deep enough‚Ä¶ my real housewives obsession was what he was looking for. 

Menopause is hard, physically and mentally. I refuse to let a mouth breathing mama‚Äôs boy who wouldn‚Äôt know where to find a woman‚Äôs clitoris try to shame me for being in a phase of life I have little control over. 

It‚Äôs probably against Reddit rules to name and shame, but he deserves to have all the pent up menopausal angst lobbed right at his misogynist ass."
10nec57,"I was engaged in a discussion on a subreddit once, and when the guy couldn't come up with anything to refute me, he tried to insinuate that my life was over because I could no longer have kids. It had nothing to do with the subject at hand, and he kept reiterating it like he expected that to hurt my feelings. I think I finally actually asked him if he was using the computer without his parent's permission."
10nec57,"I think men like to use ""menopausal"" as an insult to cover for the fact that we're no longer controlled by whether we think we're fuckable or not.  Now that we no longer have to worry about being attractive in men's eyes means that we don't really care what they think of us...and god knows many men can't stand the thought of not being front and center at all times.

(yes, I'm menopausal and yes, I ran out of fucks to give about a year ago.  The transformation into liberation of myself has been *astonishing*.  I truly just...*don't care* how men view me, if they like what I'm wearing or how long my hair is or how loud my laugh is or anything else...they can treat me like an equal or they can GTFO, it's all the same to me and the men in my life appear to find this *terrifying.*)"

10nec57,What an asshole. That stuff makes my blood boil. Creepy and weird too.
10nec57,"Well, ok or not, people are going to use your post history against you. If you had autism they'd use that. If you suffered from bipolar disorder, they'd use that. Whatever they can use against you, they will."
10nec57,"And that asshole is one of the reasons people create multiple Reddit accounts. You might want to consider keeping menopause and other health related posts one one account, and controversial views like 8.30 is late for dinner on another lol. But seriously, it‚Äôs a way to maintain some privacy when people get triggered and start digging into your history."
10nec57,Mummy issues...
10nec57,"Just laugh at their ignorance, tell him that you are the happiest, best version of yourself ever and they're just snarky, miserable little boys stuck in their mommy's basement who need to put other people down to make themselves feel superior. Then I sometimes throw in a wow your mom must be proud to have raised such a bottom feeding idiot, somebody that enjoys making fun of older women! I actually end up having a lot of fun trolling the trolls!"
10nec57,"I had, what I‚Äôm guessing as a young woman, insult me too calling me a dried vagina or something like that in response to a post about her ageism. I guess she proved my point again. I get tired of the ageism and misogyny on these pages. Not this thread, other threads. Just shows the serious lack of education around menopause. How is using a medical condition/biological process for insulting someone even acceptable?"
10nec57,What‚Äôs his name ? I will go light him up.  Starting with this ü§è
10nec57,God some men don‚Äôt deserve air.   I just block them.
10nec57,"We can moisturize our vaginas but he's stuck with that shitty personality üòÇ

I wonder if, around this age, we're seen as more of a threat because we're tired of shit and will be vocal about it. We don't want their approval and we certainly don't care to fuck them, so they go to insult based on age. Meanwhile, we're counting down the days until our last fucking periods cause we're so done with it."
10nec57,"what a complete asshat. that said, I would love it if there were a way to make this subreddit private!"
10nec57,Find his history (try r/tinypeniscommunity or r/douchenozzle) and return the favor. What a dick.
10nec57,"Wow! What a jerk! I'd go through his posting history and hope for some gold to throw back at him. Or a nice comeback like, ""Your mother must be very disappointed in the way you turned out. I have a grown child, and if I thought they were out in the world assaulting people for their physical differences and invading their privacy to obtain virtual weapons because their own intellect was insufficient to the task of a discussion, I'd be both disappointed in them and sad."""
10nec57,"Well, you handled that. I call B.S. on  their parts. You're nicer than I am. I would have told him he is losing testosterone as we speak. Come talk to me when it hits you. Evil laugh. I think O responded to the wrong thread! Sorry!"
10nec57,Well that doesn‚Äôt sound very mannerly.
10nec57,"First rule of cheap shots - never go on the defensive. Always offensive. So don‚Äôt respond to their content. Go for their insecurities. A quick history search of his name should find LOTS of material. Anyone who uses someone‚Äôs history against them, is undeniably hiding their own (Think republicans). 



I understand rising above the garbage and not doing anything. But in some cases the garbage needs to be taken out back and beaten. So if you feel like it‚Äôs not okay to use menopause, then slay this man. What else is all this rage for if we don‚Äôt use it?"
10nec57,"I go walking every day and I‚Äôll start with the usual attire for the colder weather. Often I find myself down to my T-shirt or tank top, carrying my winter coat. A few fellows have commented and I just respond with a smile ‚Äúmenopause is a bitch. We‚Äôre so unpredictable.‚Äù I think the piecing eyes and snarl help as they shut their trap and shuffle away."
10nec57,*sigh* I‚Äôve stopped myself several times from posting questions and observations here because I don‚Äôt want THIS particular post history weaponized against me
10nec57,Sounds like the usual misogynistic Reddit incel.  I just block them.  Let them shout into the void.
10nec57,"He's not terribly creative now, is he. He had to go digging, like a bored dog out in the yard all day! What a yutz."
10nec57,"I just imagine that people like that on Reddit are 14 year olds that like to talk big and try not to let their  ignorant, childish crap get in my head. Sometimes I get on Reddit and I feel like I‚Äôm in Jr High all over again ü´§"
10nec57,"Reddit is a breeding ground for incels.   This boy (not man) has likely never even seen a vagina in real life.      Sorry this happened to you but try not to take it personally it's not about you at all, it's very much about them.    Oh and men when they think they are losing an argument they always attack something about your looks and feminity, I mean insecure men. In law school they had a funny saying, if the facts are on your side, argue the facts, if the law is in your side argue the law, and if you have neither, attack your opposing counsel."
10nec57,"Oh, like this man is getting anywhere near a vagina. I do worry, though, about the stalking and sexualized violence on this site, which is somehow normalized as okay. I hope you flagged and reported him, not that that's likely to do much."
10nec57,"Look‚Ä¶if you want to dm me the username of this fine thinker or link the offensive comment in this sub, I‚Äôll be happy to send him the gps coordinates of the beehive where he can go and stick his penis‚Ä¶for a much needed enlargement.

And please take good care of your lovely and civilized self."
10nec57,"When people feel the need to resort to insults that are entirely about something no one has any choice about, it tells you how desperate they are to try to feel better about their own pitiful, fragile selves. If that guy thinks his comment is an actual criticism, I feel very sorry for him."
10nec57,"I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Unfortunately, reddit is full of incels and misogynists these days 

You might consider downloading the nuke reddit app for ms edge and running it on your usernames from time to time. You use it to remove all your posts and overwrite then delete your comments"
10nec57,That sure says a LOT about Him and not a damn thing about You!
10nec57,Did you tell him that‚Äôs poor etiquette
10nec57,"Is there a such a thing on Reddit where certain subreddits can‚Äôt be seen if you aren‚Äôt subscribed? I am sure this kind of thing will happen to me at some point too, reading about all these other run-ins. I thought people were nice on the Etiquette sub! 
Maybe if this subreddit was called something obscure:  ‚Äúwheresmyestrogen‚Äù or ‚Äúisitwarminhereorjustme‚Äù - it wouldnt upset the poor widdle teenage boys sensitivities"
10nec57,You can block him and then he won‚Äôt be able to read it.
10nec57,THAT IS AWFULLLLLL.  ugh.  On the Etiquette thread!!!! üò•üò•üò•üò• and not the first time. ü•∫ I‚Äôm so sorry. They‚Äôre just dumb.
10nec57,"Someone on Instagram yesterday told me I was old and ugly. I really wanted to shoot snarky back but ironically (as in your case), this started because of a thread about compassion. Lol."
10nec57,Wtf? I hope you reported his ass!
10nec57,Use a different profile for menopause?
10nec57,"Unbelievably rude. Btw, I‚Äôm in Toronto too and 8:30 is when I typically eat dinnerüòÜ."
10nec57,That‚Äôs creepy! You must have rattled him to pique his curiosity so much he would troll you.
10nec57,There‚Äôs an etiquette sub???
10nec57,"Lol. So you have menopause as an excuse. 

My question what is his ?"
10nec57,"Haha ,little does that fool know how hard you could rock his little world if you felt like it ü§≠"
10nec57,"Well, I had the time so I looked through his history.  It looks as if he likes men.  He has a couple post calling other men daddy.  That explains it.

What I have found in the past is that men that are extremely misogynistic are generally bisexual or undercover gay, which explains that they just don‚Äôt respect women . I know I might get down voted for this, but it‚Äôs just a personal observation.  And I‚Äôm not against bisexual or gay people, as I have good friends that are gay."
10nec57,"I think it really scares some men that a woman might be completely beyond even considering a sexual relationship with them. So it has to be rendered as a bad thing, and denigrated. It is a little creepy he's checking your other posts tho."
10nec57,My own husband is using it to hurt me.
10nec57,"üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ right? Like I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to go into his posting history because I don‚Äôt give af. 

Legit all I said was 8.30 is a bit late for dinner and he went unhinged."
10nec57,I like to tell them to calm themselves. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to get hysterical.‚Äù
10nec57,I was thinking the same thing!
10nec57,Right! Such a bad look for him.
10nec57,He‚Äôs mad about his limp dick prolly. Projection at its finest. Idiots.
10nec57,"I just looked this guy up. OMG what a fucking turd. He's a know-it-all mansplainer and says things like ""Everyone knows Goyard is not a luxury brand, it's all over TikTok how passe it is."" LOLLLLLL"
10nec57,Unfortunately we never do.  Women over 40 now are invisible to many.  Dr. Phil just had a show on regarding this.  Why is it? We are considered old hags and men get more distinguished with age. What a bunch of bullshit.
10nec57,"Excellent point, all those stupid PMS jokes and insults and now menopause insults. I'm sick of it too."
10nec57,Same.
10nec57,"Agree.  I‚Äôve heard some nasty things and its a bit jarring and hurtful because my husband‚Äôs narcissistic and he‚Äôs picked up on my vulnerability and insecurities treading this new territory and he‚Äôs mocked me with it.  I am a photographer and got by on my brains and talent and he literally told me last night that I used to get by on my looks and now that my looks are gone I‚Äôm pissed.  Huh?  No, what pissed me off was the password protected everything and acting like he had something to hide.  He‚Äôs deep into porn and yeah, it was off putting- it bothered me and I lost trust in him after discovering lies, too.  Asking him questions made him angry, and feeling hurt about the porn made him start throwing my looks in my face.  Thing is, thought I looked ok!  According to him, I think I lost my looks.  He‚Äôs punishing my insecurity and jealousy about his porn by using menopause."
10nec57,"You should call this guy in the middle of the night and say ""it's here"" in your creepiest voice then hang up. Who says menopause can't be fun."
10nec57,What is wrong with people?
10nec57,"‚ÄòAw bless, you‚Äôre impotent now aren‚Äôt you?‚Äô"
10nec57,"So women never say well, in a few short years it‚Äôs limp city for you so hope you can swallow pills-get it will never be as hard as it was;). Also reminding them that testosterone goes down at alarming rates starting in the mid twenties but DHT keeps on shrinking those hair follicles as the dad body comes on üòÇ.

Aging isn‚Äôt native to only women ;)."
10nec57,Wow. This person needs to learn when to keep his mouth shut. Good response.
10nec57,"What an ass! You should have said ‚Äòyes and so will you! It‚Äôs called low testosterone, a limp dick, and having to pee every 5 minutes‚Äô"
10nec57,"I mean, I hope so?  Its a natural part of life.  what  dumbass lol"
10nec57,"I would‚Äôve said ‚Äòwell, then you better get ready to duck‚Äô"
10nec57,What a creep
10nec57,"Did you promptly set him on fire? Because that's what you should have done. And then gone to the house mod and said, hey house mod, I'm flagging this asshat relative, please ban him from the house. No? Cool, these cookies are mine, g'bye."
10nec57,"""How did your male menopause go for you?"""
10nec57,My dried out kitty has probably has a better chance of getting laid tonight. than their limp little button dick.
10nec57,"It just shows how this person sees women in general. I feel sorry for the women in his life, if he still has any!"
10nec57,"Very good point. Although based on the history of women‚Äôs relationship to men (ie, servitude, chattels etc), it‚Äôs really not crazy at all. Unfortunately it‚Äôs only recently that we can actually forge our own identities (and then not everywhere in the world clearly)."
10nec57,WHEN WERE THEY EVER GOING TO GET IN THERE
10nec57,Ohhhhhh nice! ‚ù§Ô∏è
10nec57,This is good!
10nec57,"This is a really good point. Calling someone old--why is it an insult? I mean, everyone ages, from the second they come out of the womb. There is virtually no personal failing involved in growing old. In fact, it's rather the opposite--you're managing to stay alive."
10nec57,"The menopausal mafia to the rescue. We are hot, tired and hormonal..... DON'T PISS US OFF."
10nec57,"üòÇüòÇüòÇ 

I hid all my posts on my profile."
10nec57,Agreed. Some of them keep banging on about how they won't date anyone over 30 like we want them anyway. Oh no! üôÑ
10nec57,"A skin care sub, people are legit miserable out there and will look for anything to fight about."
10nec57,"How horrible! This is why I have my messages and chat off. No one can message or even try to message. I comment on posts and I‚Äôll have a convo there but I‚Äôm not interested in private conversations on this forum. People are creepy. 

And what you are doing is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10nec57,"Misogyny has always crossed all races, creeds, and political lines. Misogyny brings everyone together! ;P"
10nec57,"I have found this, too, among some young ""progressive"" women and it's so disheartening. Men that throw that insult usually project their difficulties with their own reproductive organs and aging, but when women say something like that, it shows there's such internalized misogyny and ageism to use the term menopausal as an insult and call other women ""dried up"". And it's even more depressing when women that believe themselves to be ""progressive"" and ""feminist,"" say those things because if the progressives and feminists think like that, I don't even want to think what the old-fashioned ones think... They'd probably want to put older women on a block of ice and send them adrift... I like to remind people that, unless an accident or disease takes them young, everyone ages and that the seeds they plant now, will be what they reap in their old age, so they'd better start planting good stuff."
10nec57,"I did last night but it‚Äôs still there. At first I was going to go in but then I thought, it‚Äôs the attention these trolls crave. So ignoring."
10nec57,"Want to add that while the term Karen, in the beginning, was actually used for racist white older women, it is now often used to shame women when they speak out. It has become quickly a sexist term used to shame women when they speak out. We shouldn't care if we are Karen if we are defending an unwanted and sexist insult."
10nec57,Little shriveled dick energy. Which is way worse than a dried up vag. At least I can use some lube.
10nec57,üíÄüíÄüíÄüëèüèΩü§åüèΩ

10nec57,Honestly he‚Äôs not worth it. But I would be horrified if my child was treating people like this online. He wasn‚Äôt raised right.
10nec57,Someone suggested two accounts. One for stuff like this and one for general posting in case trolls target us.
10nec57,LMFAO at sticking his penis in a beehive for a much needed enlargement üòÇüòÇ

10nec57,"You probably triggered him, his mom stopped bringing him chicken nuggets at his gaming station because it was ""getting late"" and now all women are heartless chicken-nugget withholders."

10nec57,"To be fair, my menopausal dried up bits do find it hard to get dinner on the table at a reasonable hour these days - maybe his significant other has the same issues with a 6pm dinner for the misogynistic asshat??? He‚Äôs likely a hungry old git üòú"
10nec57,Well it IS a bit late for dinner lol
10nec57,">was 8.30 is a bit late for dinner

Yes, undoubtedly. Way too late for my body, that's almost bedtime!"
10nec57,Lol. ‚Äú8:30 is a bit late for dinner!‚Äù That‚Äôs what  made him go berserker? Good lord
10nec57,"But it IS late for dinner. Lolol 
Sounds like he is a bit ‚Äútouched.‚Äù"
10nec57,"""Calm yer tits, kid."""
10nec57,"Bwahahaha!!! I love it! (If you know where the phrase ""hysterical"" comes from, & you're using it 'ironically', that makes it *even more* hysterical!!!)"
10nec57,Lol
10nec57,"Holy shit, I think you found Frasier Crane's reddit account."
10nec57,I'm sure he's going to find this and come after me and my dried-up pussy and Goyard bag (I actually don't have either...hah)
10nec57,Is he in high school? How lame and superficial.
10nec57,"Omg, these guys have the algorithms all wound up. I was looking at a bunch of things that these guys apparently collect around for competitive thing-having -- watches, espresso makers, you know, nice things -- and now youtube thinks I want a diet of Jordan Peterson and Scott whatshisname who writes Dilbert. And the worst, worst history videos, omg. I might have to watch Philomena Cunk a lot on purpose just to confuse it again."
10nec57,And he calls other men daddy did you see in his post
10nec57,"I might care if I had anything to do with men that I wasn't getting paid for? For real, the people making things move at work are allll women."
10nec57,Omg that‚Äôs hilarious. He‚Äôd probably really regret his comment

10nec57,It makes no sense to me in any context. A horse you can‚Äôt ride still has other uses.

10nec57,You got that right!!! Grrrrrr!

10nec57,I still see your posts and comments.
10nec57,"from reddit:

>When a person **hides a post**, the post is hidden from their feed. This means that they are the only one that won‚Äôt access the hidden post again in the future. 

>But when a person **deletes a post,** no other person can access it, including themselves.

And even then, there are ways to see someone else's posts after they've been deleted."
10nec57,I‚Äôm going to do that too I see so many comments where people say stuff like ‚Äúwell judging by your post history ‚Äú ugh I never look at that.
10nec57,How do you do this?
10nec57,"Ya, you're right. The guy was insistent that everyone over 50 that didn't get invasive procedures, like Botox, fillers or face lifts, looked like a dried-up old menopausal hag.

When I begged to differ they **all** went at me...but especially this teenage gamer kid!

I don't know WHAT his problem was, he followed me all over Reddit even posting on this sub. I reported him after he started DMing me."
10nec57,"I learned in this post I can turn the messaging off, thank you for that!"
10nec57,"And block him, ofc."
10nec57,I'm on the etiquette sub as well and I don't think the mods are very active. That sucks.

10nec57,There's a service now called Rent a Karen for when you want a woman who knows how to get your customer-service bullshit taken care of
10nec57,"Hmmm good question. If you‚Äôre on mobile and go to your profile, your username has a drop down menu and ‚Äúadd account+‚Äù is at the bottom. It gives you the option to create an account using Google, Apple ID or email. I already have a couple of emails and used a different one, but don‚Äôt know if you have to?

ETA link: https://techswift.org/2022/09/28/how-to-add-multiple-accounts-to-reddit/"
10nec57,Truth.
10nec57,I did it for you. Bitch over there posting in the 30+ skin care sub is obviously terrified (regardless of gender) at the aging coming down the pike for them. They‚Äôll understand one day and I hope they have weekly callbacks to the moment they called someone dried up when they see what 50+ really feels like.

10nec57,"I've shared before that I was the only woman in an office of men. They all got educated, but I laughed through it. I said ""I'll try not to get too bitchy."" And one of the guys said ""you mean it's going to get worse."" I started laughing, they started laughing and really it wasn't that bad. I took most of my anger out on my computer."
10nec57,Yeah and asshole I get homicidal too!!
10nec57,Ugh really? I hid most of them.
10nec57,I hate it when people do that.
10nec57,"Go to your avatar at the top right, go into profile and then posts, click the three dots and the dropdown gives option to hide."
10nec57,What?! What a loser. These people are so lacking in a any real life attention or interaction that they force it out of people online by being complete dicks to them in order to get a response. Any response is a response and any attention is attention to someone who doesn‚Äôt get it.
10nec57,Report way earlier. Like as soon as the harassment starts. This shit is wild.
10nec57,You‚Äôre welcome! Now you won‚Äôt be harassed.
10nec57,I did!
10nec57,Probably because they don‚Äôt expect this level of ridiculousness and disrespect on an etiquette sub üòÇ maybe he was lost.

10nec57,"No option to hide for me unfortunately, just save or delete."
10nec57,"I know, right? Once one gets passed the annoyance or anger their awful comments generate, you can't but end up feeling sorry for them because whether they realize it or not, they've got to be having a pretty miserable and empty existence to believe or say that kind of stuff."
10nec57,‚ù§Ô∏è
10nec57,Then treat him that way. Hey little boy did you lose your way to mommy's basement? Can we find a nice mod to help you? Would you like a cookie?

10nec57,Sometimes I get to sleep in until 04:00. Sometimes it's 01:00.
10nec57,"Niles doesn't jerk off to pro male tennis players' feet*, so he has that going for him.

*To my knowledge."
10nec57,Well I tried. Apparently it just hides from myself. Click avatar then posts then 3 dots to dropdown and then hide. It doesn‚Äôt work though.
10nec57,Really? Why would I want to hide from myself? So dumb. Thanks for letting me know
10nec57,"Go into your profile setting... This is how I found it, I feel like this should be the default and I'm annoyed it's not. I guess I didn't realize this was an option."
10nec57,Me too :(
10nec57,"Seriously my brother is one of those failure to launch types that at 51 still lives with our parents, has no job, and spends his entire day online striking up arguments with women on any platform he hasn't gotten banned from yet. He's lonely, has a lot of past substance abuse problems and it's the only kind of social contact he has with people outside family, and he has no skills to form any positive bonds. He targets women because he wants to have relationships with them, interactions with them, and he doesn't know how to have positive ones and can't emotionally handle rejection. His desperation leads him to therefore have negative interactions so he can control the outcome. He sometimes tells me really detailed stories of how he landed a zinger on one of these women he ""met"" online - he really does seem to think that he's engaging in some kind of relationship that goes far beyond the trolling they (the women) experience. 


I think of him every time I see these reddit guys with a zillion posts, most downvoted, just following posters around to harass them. They think they are having relationships with the women. It is likely the only relationships they have with women. 

It's appalling. It's literally their entire social life."
10nec57,"I wish I could, I hate confrontation. And these trolls are vile. I don‚Äôt want their attention on me for an extended period of time."
10nec57,"Believe me, it was a pleasure!"
10nec57,"LOL exactly. He's really into their feet. 

I'm really surprised. Considering he took someone to the mat calling them lower class individuals for wanting others to take shoes off when indoors. Given this foot fetish of his, you'd think he'd be Team No Shoes In The House (BAYBEY! SLURRRRP!)"
10nec57,"wait, whaat?!? :D"

113h5to,"African here, and I've been laying into the women in my family for keeping quiet!

Apparently, there's no need to make noise about it as we just get on with it! 

I'm breaking that chain and making a lot of noise. 
It's interesting how my aunts and cousins, who are about 2/3/4 years older than me, are piping up about their symptoms!

So it's probably the same thing. I was also told I'm too westernised and have become soft üòÖ"
113h5to,"Lol, no. In India, women just ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù according to a top gynaec I saw there. It‚Äôs a taboo topic, and unfortunately, women don‚Äôt seek help unless there are major physical issues (like heavy bleeding). The funny thing is that HRT is easily available at any pharmacy without a prescription. Women just don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs out there. There is zero education about peri/menopause."
113h5to,"They say that with every gyn condition - it's just us Westerners or our spoiled generation. My asian family all had menopause issues and it was pretty taboo. I even remember my mum poking fun at my grandma's symptoms. Then when I came to it (early, as I was surgical) they wanted to keep the cycle of taboo/gaslighting/""I suffered so you should"" BS and I refuse. F them and F those ignorant, lazy doctors."
113h5to,"Your Doctor is outright lying. The only reason you dont hear much on women‚Äôs health from us (iam Indian) is because women‚Äôs health is a more or less a taboo subject . People find the topic‚Äòcringeworthy‚Äô. They will be uncomfortable if you talk openly about Menopause. As if menopause dosent exist. The biggest fear is you will not be perceived as a ‚Äòwhole woman‚Äô from hereon. Iam atleast breaking the chain. Iam 49 and went into menopause when i turned 47. I have openly discussed this my kids and friends. Sometimes i find it amazing is out of big group of friends iam the only one experiencing menopause and its symptoms, rest of them haven‚Äôt even admitted to menopause üòÄSo there you go."
113h5to,"I live in the U.S but was born and raised in South Asia. Indian women tend to enter menopause earlier than the rest of the world. South Asians also have the highest rate of severe heart issues and an incredibly high rate of T2D even while maintaining low weight. Doctors think it has to do with our diet post colonialism, and especially because of our recent dependence on rice. I didn‚Äôt hear about women complaining about hot flashes when I was a little kid but I did hear all of the other complaints, especially about hair texture change and moodiness."
113h5to,Time to find a new doctor.
113h5to,"I live in an east Asian country (and am Soutb Asian myself) and it seems like women here are content with living with some of the symptoms such as hair loss and loss of libido. Certainly, there isn‚Äôt as much weight gain because most women were thin to begin with and I know that can have a cascaded of benefits. There‚Äôs also a lot of traditional remedies and acupuncture but I‚Äôm not sure which of these have a lot of robust data backing them up. I‚Äôm sure some of them work. 

What strikes me is that women seem content to slide into the next phase of life sideways: early retirement, filial piety, patriarchal values , these all seem to play into it. 

So yes, while they may have fewer symptoms or are masking them better, it‚Äôs also about framing it so that your role in life is to sit in the corner and become a respected old lady that is cared for. Not all of us have that luxury, and certainly not all of us would chose that."
113h5to,"Eastern woman here and a biologist. 

VERY PERIMENOPAUSAL.

While diet plays an important role in general health and has been shown to play a role in changes in development and puberty (eg. late or early onset of puberty) I haven‚Äôt found any studies that indicate diet can fully contradict the symptoms caused by massive and erratic changes in hormone production during either puberty or perimenopause. 

As others have said, time to find a new doctor. If you want to confront this doctor, ask them to reference the study which has led them to this conclusion."
113h5to,"Of course menopause is not a behavioral problem that comes as a punishment to a subgroup of women for their lifetime of Western excess. It's a biochemical change that comes from a decline in circulating estrogen. And yeah it's entirely possible that diet, intestinal bacterial community dynamics, environmental chemicals and genetics play a role, so we might see differences based on geography, culture and population genetics - but *even if that were true*, since HRT is currently prescribed for treating symptoms, it shouldn't really matter if a particular aspect of Western life was exacerbating the estrogen issues. If we *have* issues, for any reason, that's what the doctor should be treating so it's really more of an academic exercise to wonder which of the million puzzle pieces configure to amplify or reduce some of the symptoms on average across an entire set of continents."
113h5to,"I‚Äôm an African woman at the height of Peri, where can I apply for my Western card? Every older female relative I knew when young became a shadow of their former self when they reached a certain age. Now I know it was Peri/menopause"
113h5to,"That‚Äôs a bit reductionist. I hope they didn‚Äôt also talk of Orientals and call your husband to discuss your hysteria. 

Sarcasm aside, common sense would say there are a lot of factors involved in how different people deal with menopause, even within the same culture."
113h5to,"I think he is full of it. Women who live long enough are going to go through it regardless of how the culture deals with or more accurately, DOESN'T deal with it. 

It is an evolutionary fact. World wide. If diet had a significant impact on it, someone would have figured out how to make money off it and the advertising would be everywhere. 

And speaking of evolution, he seems to be several branches lower than current homo-sapiens."
113h5to,"I would LOVE to know how to purchase HRT without a prescription. I‚Äôm in a very underserved health area, many docs are either dismissive of or not knowledgeable re: menopause treatment. I have no issues with routine testing such a mammograms or other exams but I hate being held prisoner by their protocols. ‚ÄúNeed a mammogram every 6 months‚Äù. Pap Smear after a certain age ( insurance won‚Äôt cover) or no HRT for you. I‚Äôm very in tune with my body, have nearly 45 years of experience in healthcare and I trust my own assessment of my health status vs someone more concerned with profit than my wishes. I watch for any off symptoms and try to listen to my body.
Basically this boils down to I‚Äôd love to be on HRT for my joints/heart health/skin & hair issues and my worst symptom, atrophy. I was on pellets for a few years but became disillusioned as some times I‚Äôd have some positive side effects and other times I couldn‚Äôt tell any difference.
So basically, how can I get estradiol and testosterone on my own??  Can I order from an overseas pharmacy??"
113h5to,"This is just another way of ‚Äúblaming the victim‚Äù I‚Äôm so sick of health counselors saying change your diet, quit caffeine, quit drinking, quit your stressful job, exercise and meditate all day long. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a symbol of ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù and ‚Äúpiety‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fault‚Äù for being unhealthy and having symptoms. The only way to feel better is to take on the life of a yoga instructor or a monk. Eastern women are just raised to not complain it‚Äôs the patriarchy people not tofu."
113h5to,These are the same people that claim homosexuality is only a western thing. Of course it's not.
113h5to,"Many many years ago I heard journalists saying that Japanese women had less issues because they consumed a lot of soy and fish in their diets.

I tried googling it and found this website. 

[https://menopauseexperts.com/menopause-in-japan/](https://menopauseexperts.com/menopause-in-japan/)"
113h5to,Your doctor is an ass
113h5to,I think you need a new doctor because he‚Äôs üíØ wrong.  r/confidentlyincorrect
113h5to,"My mom had symptoms but was quiet about them.  In certain parts of the world, they're still very much entrenched in the patriarchal view/ways of things and don't speak out/up about them so while they still experience symptoms, they just have to deal with them."
113h5to,Yeah totally. Like a crew of magical multiethnic Disney princesses. /s
113h5to,Indian here. Recently asked my mother about her menopause. Asked her if she had any hot flashes etc. She told me menopause just happened. She didn't mention any specific symptoms.
113h5to,I heard from someone that Asian women tend to have fewer menopause symptoms and that this may be linked to the general conception that their diet is high in soy e.g. tofu etc. Not sure how true that is
113h5to,"Methinks he's been sucking down an unbalanced diet of ""wellness"" and ""holistic"" nutritionist influencers, while ignoring scientific data. 

Not to mention a heaping pile of misogynistic bullshit, ""if you women would just eat HEALTHIER, you wouldn't have these PROBLEMS!""

Please write a grievance letter to that practice and insurance carrier."
113h5to,I've heard a few such assertions. Would love to know more about it
113h5to,Fire his ass and fill out online reports where you grade doctors. I run every doctor I‚Äôm refered to or am researching by patient review sites now.
113h5to,"First off, get a new doctor and also contact the clinic of your current doctor and make a complaint. This doctor is spreading information that can be incredibly harmful to their patients. They basically told you that your menopausal symptoms were created because of something you did to yourself and not actually a biological condition. It‚Äôs total pseudoscience bullshit and goes against all scientific evidence. 

Secondly, I have Premature Ovarian Insufficiency. I‚Äôve had it since my early 20‚Äôs. I also live in the states. I eat an incredibly healthy diet and have for a large part of my life. But this never helped decrease the Menopausal symptoms that came on and that continue to afflict me with this diagnosis. It also seems to afflict a lot of the ladies in my POI group who live ALL over the world! We suffer, some in silence. Some more openly. But no, it‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúwestern world‚Äù problem. So sorry this happened to you."
113h5to,"Even in the western world, the older gen does not talk about it. They consider it a private matter and just suffer. My mother said, ""it was bad, but I just dealt with it"" Like, no mam, absolutely not will I be doing that!"
113h5to,Read The Menopause Manifesto by Dr. Jen Gunter; it‚Äôs so helpful.
113h5to,"I did my thesis on menopause in Chinese medical school and my research showed that it was more of a modern problem not an east vs west issue. By modern I mean there was not a lot of medicine research west or eastern put into the  phase of menopause until the 1800s in the west (France) and To be fair also I did my thesis in 2006. 
It was acknowledged in the west sooner that the east. Likely due to cultural differences. 
Here is a modern writer who has a book from 2019 about the history of menopause. 

https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/a-time-of-change-understanding-menopause/

Your DR is not correct exactly and is short sited. But here‚Äôs the thing. The modern world has amped up the symptoms of Menopause for some/ many. Including exposure to toxins (this could include food but also many other things including drugs) and especially modern stresses. Also there are a lot of people on this planet which makes everything more in general. 

Some peoples bodies are more prone to the symptoms of menopause due to genetics and lifestyle, but everyone with a uterus goes through menopause no matter what you eat."
113h5to,"My diet can exacerbate my symptoms (sugars and ultra  processed foods). I have no weight issues as well, but had a full on breakdown in the middle of menopause. Diet is only one component."
113h5to,That's just another way to dismiss women and women's health.
113h5to,Eastern world????  üôÑüôÑ
113h5to,"Incredibly reductionist statement, however diet will have an impact on our health in general, and clearly on our hormonal health. Just consider that Caucasians have the least amount of diary intolerance, which is why they happily consume all diary and lots of it. And stop for a moment to think what is diary - the milk of a large animal meant to make a calf grow to 400kg in 6 months. That takes a lot of growth hormone, sex hormones not to mention antibiotics largely used in the milk industry. So just from diary consumption alone both men and women may become estrogen dominant. 

Fun fact about soy products is that they contain a protective form of estrogen. So you could argue that switching from diary to tofu may help our hormonal health. 

I'm also thinking about the hormone disruptors we're exposed to, and I guess a person living in a more rural traditional way, may have lower levels of exposure. 

All in all menopause as well as all PMS, PMDD could be exacerbated by the western lifestyle."
113h5to,My mom is American Caucasian but we lived in Asia because my dad is Asian. She had very little symptoms and was able to get rid of her hot flashes by drinking soy milk everyday. The kind you buy freshly made from the street vendor (it tastes totally different then the kind I get at the supermarket in the US). So there might be some validity around that theory?? It‚Äôs interesting because I live in the US now and in perimenopause and I already have more symptoms than she did.
113h5to,"Get a new doctor ASAP, this is very old school myth. My family ran a business and one of our employees had a husband like this. He told her she couldnt eat meat because it made her period longer. She couldnt take a bath because bacteria would crawl inside her and make her to dry for him. The list goes on and on. The fact that a ""medical"" professional told you this is a massive red flag and you need to run as fast as you can to another doctor."
113h5to,"No, I think there is a cultural element to which symptoms are discussed and disclosed. My talking openly has helped so many friends and colleagues. But, if you live in a culture where talking about your day vagina is so taboo you can't fathom such a thing, then you keep quiet and get on with it--hiding all the unsavory ""women's issues.""

I do think there are important differences, across cultures, about perceptions on aging, and that impacts how we frame the transition, symptoms, etc.--but that doesn't negate the physical symptoms of hormone fluctuations."
113h5to,Please find a new doctor. You deserve to be taken seriously and receive proper treatment. This rutabaga is not going to help you.
113h5to,"I actually just was listening to some people on a podcast talk about this, and I think there is some evidence that belief that menopause is going to be bad/inconvenient or otherwise harrowing actually contributes to those things happening, to some degree.

In that sense, most Eastern cultures don‚Äôt have that negativity bias about meno- and it may or may not be that their actually symptoms are less. Also, some have other modalities (like acupuncture or Aryveda) with very good track records for balancing the body. 

I think we can acknowledge woman‚Äôs experiences of menopause and also acknowledge that mindset about it is important. For me, I have had symptoms over the past decade probably, but I try to look at it as a natural process. (The peri- years with the heavy, heavy bleeding were tough!). As for hot flashes, I‚Äôve had panic attacks, so these are no biggie for me, honestly. You mean I am just going to get hot and NOT feel like I am dying? I can deal with that."
113h5to,"Not from the East (I'm mixed heritage Black and Native American) but I call BS on your doctor...

All women deal with menopause/perimenopause. The severity of symptoms has just as much to do with your genetics and diet as it does your culture and environment. Sure East Asian women eat a lot of soy and tofu, but that doesn't mean they NEVER experience symptoms. Or that their culture is any better at navigating women's health than western nations. For further evidence please read Unwell Women by Elinor Cleghorn, she details in depth the failings of the medical system on women's health the world over"
113h5to,"Time for a new doctor.

I can't stand this attitude that every single thing that happens to us health wise is our fault. It led me to thinking I could fix symptoms if I just worked out harder, ate an even healthier diet than I already eat, meditate, yada, yada, yada.  It was all bullshit.  I ran myself into the ground thinking it was my fault I felt so horrible most of the time. I actually have a rare blood cancer that got missed by, let's see, at least five doctors for six years.   It would have killed me if it had gone on much longer without appropriate care.

Stand up for yourself and the care you deserve.  If this person is shaming you for the fact of your geological location, how can you trust they'll listen to your concerns and prescribe the correct treatments?"
113h5to,"I have had a lot of shame with going into menopause. I knew it was inevitable but it happening to ME just something that was hard to acknowledge, it meant I was getting old ! 
   I wonder if this is the reason none of my friends or relatives talked about it . We‚Äôd rather be in silent misery than acknowledge to ourselves and everyone else we are getting old . 
 Everything is changing and it‚Äôs hard to consider it‚Äôs because the better part of my life has been lived . My hair is greying , my vagina is like the Sahara desert , energy level is -10 and my mood is really shitty . Oh and I‚Äôve had breast cancer twice in the last 2 1/2 years . Not only am I not able to take HRT , I actually have to take a hormone blocker to stop the little bit of estrogen my pituitary glad in my brain emits ! I am a miserable old Bitch . 
   You ladies who are able to take HRT , keep taking it ! You are so so lucky ."
113h5to,"No, I work for a global company and we had a session for women on the topic and women from around the world were there. We have sharing communities and it‚Äôs everywhere. Some cultures foster more open dialogue than others. One thing I hear from women is Asia is they appreciate the Americans and Europeans taking talking about it openly."
113h5to,"I‚Äôve wondered if this time of human development is when all the hormone affecting things we have ingested and spewed about the plant have come home to roost. 


There are definitely more transgendered issues, and I think there is more talk of peri / meno in the mainstream, the zeitgeist hasn‚Äôt hit yet."
113h5to,"That is the thing, as soon as I started talking about my symptoms, older relatives started saying what they were going through. I felt very betrayed by them keeping quiet"
113h5to,"''You've become too Americanized"" how many times did I hear this when I was talking about mental health years ago and not being taken seriously!"
113h5to,"That is sad because if it was men who suffered doctors would have got training in it from year dot and they would be getting HRT thrown at them but us women have to get on with it.
Most of our doctors here in the UK are useless absolutely useless so you have to demand HRT, they say we only know its menopause when you haven't had a period for 12 months most don't have any idea about perimenopause either as that is the worse time!"
113h5to,"That‚Äôs fascinating! There was definitely some silence in my family, though oddly enough, not from my mom, but my sisters. I‚Äôm the youngest and when I asked them how it went, there was a dismissive, ‚Äúoh yeah, that happened.‚Äù"
113h5to,"They're coming around.  I talk about it pretty openly to the auntijis and my peers without much shame and most have been pretty engaging about it once the conversation starts. I was lucky enough to get an understanding gynae (older woman), who informed me of my options and recommended I get back onto bcp for a few years before considering other forms of HRT as it was cheapest and easiest to manage."
113h5to,"Awww the poor women in India have to just get on with it, sad isn't it how women are treated like 2nd class citizens. All those beautiful ladies locked up in the olden days for hysteria when most of it was menopause. If it wasn't for HRT I knew I definitely would have topped myself or maybe got locked up myself."
113h5to,"That‚Äôs a very good point‚Äîthe ‚ÄúI suffered and so should you‚Äù or even the ‚ÄúI ‚Äòsuffered‚Äô and it really wasn‚Äôt that bad at all!‚Äù is so common in a woman‚Äôs experience in general. It‚Äôs the ignorance sometimes but also spitefulness that drives women to feel like their symptoms are normal because everyone around them also has them‚Äîand isn‚Äôt making a stink over them. If your mother had heavy, painful periods, that was normal for her so why should you be any different? They doctor couldn‚Äôt do anything for her, why would it be different for you? It‚Äôs pervasive throughout a woman‚Äôs life. It just shows we have to be out best advocate when we feel like something is not right."
113h5to,Just like western women a generation ago.
113h5to,"> Doctors think it has to do with our diet post colonialism, and especially because of our recent dependence on rice.

interesting, i've also read / heard that the dietary shift from cooking with butterfat (ghee) to highly processed seed oils high in omega-6 fatty acids (sesame oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil, soybean oil, etc) may play a role in current patterns of health problems as well

in the US at least these oils are still commonly promoted as ""healthy,"" but there's an interesting body of research coming out over the past few decades seriously calling that into question... to me it's starting to look similar to the pattern in which we were told for years that margarine was healthier than butter until they learned trans fats are far more damaging than saturated fats

cardiologist dr. pradip jamnadas discusses this issue of the shift in fat sources in contemporary south asian diets in some of his online talks, i'm pretty sure that's where i first came across it"
113h5to,"Seriously, I‚Äôm pissed off for OP. She deserves better!"
113h5to,Yes! I‚Äôm curious if he has any sources of if this is his own theory
113h5to,That is grim
113h5to,I love the description ‚Äúa shadow of their former self‚Äù because that‚Äôs exactly how I feel in perimenopause.
113h5to,"There's also a culture, (atleast in Kenya in my family and friends circle), where woman are not really allowed to 'make it about themselves', if they're talking about something that others are not talking about. So in public they're acting like 'all's good here' but in private, they're suffering and miserable.  High religiosity makes it worse too."
113h5to,"Absolutely spot on and don't forget food was organic in the 40s etc no microwave meals everything was cooked fresh and they said during the war even though food was rationed their diet was better than today's diet but women were locked up for hysteria or if you went to see a relative family members would whisper to my mum it's the change, it was all hushed up in those days!"
113h5to,"You don't need an overseas pharmacy. I found out about an online company, Evernow, from this  sub and I am beyond grateful. Spent a year and half bouncing from my regular GP, gyno and endocrinologist with nothing but a pat on the head, and being told that my blood work was fine, that I'm menopausal and sent in my way. 20 months of sheer misery. I mention Evernow so much now people are going to start thinking I work for them , but I'm just so grateful that I can't help but talk about it they're completely online, you're assigned a doctor who you visit virtually with, fill out some forms and they ship you your HRT. I get a estradiol patch and a progesterone pill. You do have to have a mammogram every year, but you're supposed to do that anyway. Each month doc checks in with you via the app. I highly recommend them"
113h5to,"I buy everything I use from Amazon. Estrogen cream, DHEA cream and lots of supplements. The only thing I get local is Progesterone only pill"
113h5to,I buy it on line are you in the UK?
113h5to,1500 species agree. Ours is the only one with a problem with homosexuality.
113h5to,Interesting! Very curious about diet. I don‚Äôt really consume a lot of soy.
113h5to,Also the effect alcohol has on estrogen metabolites and sugars link to inflammation.
113h5to,"You are lucky because all I hear from older people is oh it never affected me or in work people say oh I have no problem at all with it.  They need to tell their faces that because most our miserable as sin, some are on antidepressants or sleeping tablets, some drink to much to cope but no menopause doesn't affect them, I keep my gob shut and just leave them to it."
113h5to,"I wonder how hard it is for men to get Viagra? (Just kidding, I know it's super easy!)"
113h5to,"I mean if you think about it, most middle-class women past a certain age seem to be overweight,  with hip or knee issues, and generally unhappy. Just being able to openly talk about it might have helped an entire generation of women manage better."
113h5to,"My family lives in a smaller (tier 3) city, so the conversations are not as prevalent unfortunately. But when I went to visit (and find me some HRT), I was open about it to my aunts and it certainly started the conversation. So that‚Äôs a win!"
113h5to,"We know sunflowers are inspirational plants, even to famous painters. Vincent Van Gogh loved sunflowers so much, he created a famous series of paintings, simply called ‚Äòsunflowers‚Äô."
113h5to,The thought of never being myself again ‚Ä¶ unbearable
113h5to,"I am using them now and they are good. They still follow the ‚Äúneed this test to get an rx‚Äù- the mammogram for example. Yes, I should be getting them and I have been-just don‚Äôt like to be told when by anyone. And because of my age they wouldn‚Äôt prescribe anything but cream for me in spite of me telling them I‚Äôd been on pellets for several years and my body overall was suffering from the sudden withdrawal."
113h5to,"Can you give a general idea of the cost? Start up appointments, monthly appointments, monthly cost for the prescription refill?"
113h5to,What I don't like about Evernow is they don't seem to offer testosterone but that must be (for max availability) by shots or pellets so I guess unless they have Drs on the ground they can't...just DHEA which is just a precursor
113h5to,"I do not think the creams you can buy online at Amazon can be fully trusted by any means. For estrogen, you want to have a prescription product."
113h5to,"No, US."
113h5to,Great point! Especially beer which is highly estrogenic.
113h5to,"My mom insists her menopause was symptom-free. She just blissfully slid into a period-free life sometime in her forties. I call BS.

She also swears all 6 of her pregnancies were glorious experiences. Child birth was painless. Even her long labors. I call BS. 

And in those 40-odd years she has a period she never had a period cramp. I call BS.

And now I talk about these things so the young women on my life aren't blindsided by the ways our bodies can be a source of pain and, at times, misery."
113h5to,Mmmm. This seems like a gross over-generalization. Got any stats to back this up?
113h5to,"Indeed! The tricky part is finding a good gynae to give you a reasonable diagnosis and treatment,  rather than to just ""deal with it"". Our moms/grandmoms didn't deal with it, they were literally invisible and unheard as older women."
113h5to,What I don‚Äôt like about Evernow is the $49 a month membership to text a nurse practitioner. She gets back to you within 24 hours and she‚Äôs perfectly helpful but what am I going to do just complain about my symptoms. She just gives a lot of cut and paste responses and I certainly don‚Äôt need to pay a recurring $49 a month for this if this hormone prescription doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôll try another combination and eventually if I settle on something that‚Äôs working I‚Äôll get another doctor to prescribe it. Everything Evernow prescribes is FDA approved so hopefully my insurance will pay for it. I have a standard Obama care plan. I really prefer the set up for Winona- their online services seemed more comprehensive and offered more choices and I would‚Äôve went with them except they don‚Äôt prescribe in New York right now.
113h5to,"I pay $49 a month for the Evernow membership and I just ordered an estrogen patch and progesterone pills they are charging me $80 a for. So for me, out of pocket it will be $130 a month. What I‚Äôm planning on doing, if these make me feel better is getting the same script written from a doctor, either my gp or my brother in law so my insurance will pay for it."
113h5to,"It‚Äôs working for me very well, I would have offed myself if I didn‚Äôt have them and I‚Äôm in a country where HRT or any menopause assistance is unheard of. I did lots of research and experimented before I found what works for me"
113h5to,"All the yummy things damn it! caffeine, sugar, alcohol. I know my mom and my grandmothers did not have the same lifestyle what so ever."
113h5to,My ex-mother-in-law described her 3 labors as a sensation and no pain. Absolutely BS. I think it‚Äôs supposed to be a shining example of their generation not complaining.
113h5to,OMG ME TOO! She also never had a period cramp. BS!
113h5to,"I was speaking anecdotally with what I've observed, but there actually is a study on the link between class and weight of Indian women: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089075/

According to this 2006 study, over 20% of women in urban areas are overweight or obese. Of this percentage, women of a higher (hence my mentioning middle class) socio-economic background are far more likely to be in that category than those in the EWS (economically weaker section). 

Now this study is accounting for women between the ages of 15-49. As it is, there already is a weight disparity that happens to women post child birth and peri menopause. The study does not delve into the specifics of post pregnancies and menopause.

However, as with anywhere else in the world, women post child -birth and in peri menopause have a harder time keeping their pre-childbirth weight, hence we can *assume* that women in this group are far more likely to be overweight than the average pre-childbirth woman.

Eta: the study does mention that women aged 35+ are 5 times more likely to be obese than women of 15-25 years."
10vqlae,"Some doctors‚Äîthe ones who are knowledgeable and educated‚Äîdon‚Äôt wait until official menopause. I‚Äôm still in peri, and I‚Äôm on HRT. Lots of us on here! Just gotta find a doctor who knows what‚Äôs up."
10vqlae,"I‚Äôm in peri and started progesterone because of hot flashes, sleep disturbances and mood swings. I‚Äôm choosing to manage this as a process‚Äî treating the symptoms as they come and working with my doctor to keep myself functional. 

I refuse to wait until I‚Äôm post menopausal to start addressing this. I have a family, a job, and a life, and I can‚Äôt take a few years off (or, if I‚Äôm like my mom, 14 years off) to get through this. 

Any doctor who refuses HRT until a woman is post menopausal is ignorant and should be fired, imo."
10vqlae,">My question is why do drs recommend waiting until a year without a period to begin HRT?

Because many doctors don't understand menopause or treatment options."
10vqlae,I don't know. I'm your age and lied about the frequency and date of my last period to get relief from the hot flashes.
10vqlae,In peri and I flat out demanded HRT. This group encouraged me to advocate for myself. I did and it worked.
10vqlae,"When I was in peri, I had two female doctors tell me that if the symptoms 'got too bad,"" to let them know and they would discuss hormone replacement therapy with me.

At that point, I picked up some brochures in their waiting rooms about menopause and read them. But I didn't get enough or the right information from the brochures. I had done some reading online, but didn't get a complete picture of what was happening or what to do about it. The information was incomplete and conflicting.

Several of my friends had been through menopause ahead of me, but they didn't talk about it, I guess because of stigma. The one friend who did talk about it when I asked was using folk remedies because she doesn't have insurance, so I did not use her suggestions. (I don't think her folk remedies are working because she's now hostile most of the time. She was written up at work twice for being rude to people.)

It wasn't until I came to this Reddit group that I started getting helpful information and a better picture of what was going on---a year after menopause."
10vqlae,"My physician hasn‚Äôt waited. He put me on HRT last year, at 49, while my periods were still pretty regular. I was having trouble sleeping, he figured it was time.

Your physician is probably waiting due to outdated information."
10vqlae,"I am also curious about this. Thank you for asking this question. I wonder if starting sooner would have spared me unhealthy weight gain and a couple years of insomnia, which causes accelerated aging."
10vqlae,I‚Äôm in peri and am on HRT for symptoms.
10vqlae,"Before I started HRT I used an otc progesterone cream called Progesto-life that I bought online. It absolutely helped me sleep, helped my friend with hot flashes (I never had any) and someone in a class I take called me an Angel sent from God because it also helped her with her insomnia. Also, as I got farther along and the cream didn‚Äôt help as much I asked my GP for progesterone for sleep. He was reluctant until I showed him articles from PubMed with studies showing that progesterone helped sleep. He gave me an rx for 100mg nightly and I slept like the dead on it."
10vqlae,"Why would you wait until hormones are depleted to counteract a deficiency? They didn‚Äôt wait until my thyroid is destroyed completely by hashimotos to substitute thyroid hormone.

Bottom line: Because doctors are clueless and it still goes around in people‚Äôs heads that this is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù process. Which it is‚Ä¶meant for humans who usually died young. It is our unfortunate loss that the follicles  produce the majority of our hormones and not the ovaries and we have a limited number of viable follicles.   
To be blunt, cancer is natural, even plants have it. Do we just lie down and take it, then?

You can bet if males stopped producing testosterone in the middle of their lives there would be hundreds of well researched treatment options."
10vqlae,"I cant take HRT‚Ä¶what are my
options if any?"
10vqlae,"I‚Äôm in peri and started 1.5 years ago at age 44. 
My doc is a menopause hormone expert, though."
10vqlae,I‚Äôm also in peri (48) and take HRT for symptom relief
10vqlae,"Not sure why some would wait, but many of us are on it with periods still! 

My best guess is just some are hanging on to old information (aka, a doctor who doesn‚Äôt keep up)."
10vqlae,"I‚Äôm 48, not in meno but in peri and I‚Äôve been using HRT for the past year. I saw a new gynecologist & was armed with loads of info stating how important HRT is for those in peri..she didn‚Äôt need to see it & was already on board thankfully!

Be your own advocate. Good luck"
10vqlae,"I am 55 and still bleeding irregularly and I am on HRT.  Stopped the hot flashes within a week.  Sleeping much improved. Still stupid periods that are not painful but will not stop once they start, but I think my body just still needs to bleed.   Being Fat.  Well.  It didn't really help that.  I lift weights 2 times a week and walk but I'm still meno fat. I don't eat added sugar, and have tried keto, remain low carb, but gave up on keto as it was making me feel sick.  Mostly vegetarian now.  Weight still won't budge. I now accept this extra 25 pounds for who I must need to be. (for now)  There are lots of internet sales people though willing to sell you snake oil to fix that.  ;)   I done with buying their crap.  Good luck to you."
10vqlae,"Actually - the neuroprotective, heart, and bone benefits of HRT are BEFORE full meno.  The recent NYT article gets into it.  Your doc is misinformed."
10vqlae,"I assume it's because one might get symptoms of excess estrogen in peri with HRT like breast tenderness (I certainly have, severe at first but have probably declined with my hormones, it's been an extremely difficult balancing act, anything but easy, but I went on it soon after hot flashes hit before periods were even stopped for many months).

Also I don't think I'll ever know when or if I hit full menopause on HRT as I don't bleed on HRT.  Which is pretty irrelevant compared to symptom relief and side effects of HRT, which is my actual concern most of the time.

I wouldn't recommend black cohosh or yoga necessarily, THC for sleep though ... it might really help."
10vqlae,I‚Äôm 42. I would have periods if I weren‚Äôt taking HRT.
10vqlae,"My specialist said I needed hrt right away the day I saw him I was day 178 no period because I‚Äôm only 43 and it‚Äôs to early to have no hormones, and that I‚Äôll have to take for at least 10 years in some sort. I had some many tests and ultrasounds Ct scans to check everything else
My right ovary is full of eggs in a chain of pearls ? Something about that. And my lining after 178 days was 1.5mm"
10vqlae,I've 54 and been on HRT( low dose of estrogen & progesterone) pill form for a year and still getting a period.  My dr is perplexed!   I'm gng to see her in a few weeks to discuss doing a DNC and take it from there and  hopefully put me on the estrogen patch!
10vqlae,I started during peri and don‚Äôt plan to stop. I‚Äôm not at a high cancer risk and my dr said a recent bone scan was one of the best he has seen.  It was honestly life changing for me. I‚Äôve been fully in menopause for a few years but don‚Äôt want my bones and joints to deteriorate.
10vqlae,I'm in peri and on HRT.
10vqlae,"I‚Äôm on HRT and not in full menopause (I am in that moving ‚Äúfinal year‚Äù though). HRT isn‚Äôt for post menopausal treatment generally, but specifically for folks who are dealing with unbearable hot flashes / night sweats. That is the key complaint that will see HRT offered to you (or at least should). 

Prescription is not based on any hormone level testing, but only based on symptoms. This is because no two people will experience the same symptoms at the same hormone levels. Some folks have no symptoms or fully manageable symptoms. Other folks, like myself, couldn‚Äôt imagine continuing on one more day with months of, at best, 2-3 hours of greatly interrupted sleep a night week in and week out."
10vqlae,"Because before full menopause, your own hormones are still fluctuating wildly, so it's impossible to regulate dosages/levels unless you get a blood test every single day."
10vqlae,I got my HRT in perimenopause. Altough my FSH level was also about 70. One doc said that I am at the end of perimenopause because of FSH and one said that the level of that does not matter. I still had some periods. At the moment I really do not know if I have any more periods or not as I have Mirena IUD.
10vqlae,My dr said it‚Äôs not so much whether it‚Äôs peri or meno but whether or not your body is still producing hormones. Only way to tell is to test where your hormones are at.
10vqlae,"Most Reg PCPs/Gynos are VERY misinformed or plain lack the knowledge and have not viewed the latest info on HRT and continue to believe the old studies. Its a good thing that WE have the ability to see ALL this information, new studies on HRT and the many many benefits just by doing searches online. 

We are all different and what works for one may not work for others but sharing our stories can help guide others where to look and what to try to find their combo for treatment and IT IS a combo of treatments ... cause there is no magic pill unfortunately... I wish you the best in your journey :)"
10vqlae,"This - HRT is primarily to manage the symptoms of menopause - most of which start in peri-menopause, there is also recent research that suggests the earlier you start it the less damage to your heart and it can reduce the risk of alzheimers. 

I‚Äôve been on HRT for about 15 months now and am currently 7-8 months since my last period."
10vqlae,Yes! I‚Äôm so grateful I found a doc that practices this way.  Took me firing 3 docs before her to get there so I always recommend not taking ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer and to advocate for yourself.  Be armed with knowledge and you won‚Äôt fold to pressure
10vqlae,My doc said I could start HRT after I go through meno - until then it‚Äôs BCP. He said it‚Äôs functionally the same thing. Idk if the second statement is 100% accurate or just a characterization for me as a layman.
10vqlae,"No truer words. 
I Also can‚Äôt take a few years off. 
And I need 14!"
10vqlae,Dam wish i could have u help me find a dr for my muscle weakness that started in peri 3yrs ago!! Been to 4 specialists and gona start hrt soon but muscles all tire out doin almost anyrhing and none of these drs can help!!!üíñüôè
10vqlae,Same here.
10vqlae,"Sleep problems are what started me on the HRT path, and I was/am in early peri. OP needs a new doc!"
10vqlae,"maybe some weight gain, I started 4-5 months after symptoms and when still having periods, Im still at the highest weight of my life and maybe always will be now.  I do agree sleep is important though!"
10vqlae,"How even? What did these physicians do during the lectures about sex hormones?

Progesterone massively improves quality of sleep by being metabolized to allopregnanolone. This is textbook knowledge. Don‚Äôt even need studies for that. Like it‚Äôs the basis you start out with as a physician (or pharmacist)

Similar neurosteroids to allopregnanolone are used as anesthetic in veterinary medicine. That‚Äôs how potent they can be.


Lacking progesterone causes insomnia and anxiety."
10vqlae,Men do produce less testosterone as they age. And many of them are taking T.
10vqlae,Why can't you take MHT/HRT?
10vqlae,Look at menopause Barbie on YouTube.  Aka Dr. Barbara Taylor explains all options for women during this time.
10vqlae,"I like your ""for now"" and not wasting money on snake oil! I'm fat, too, for now...‚ô•Ô∏è"
10vqlae,"The protection is ongoing.  Women who start within 10 years of Menopause will still see benefits. Probably not as much as if they started earlier, but still valuable."
10vqlae,"As long as the cycle is still fully working, it can help to also cycle the estrogen, though breast tenderness usually only happens if you‚Äôve been starved of estrogen for a while already."
10vqlae,"It‚Äôs fantastic, can‚Äôt recommend enough!"
10vqlae,"Maybe I missed your comment, but why are you taking HRT?‚ô•Ô∏è"
10vqlae,"Maybe I missed your comment, but why are you taking HRT?‚ô•Ô∏è"
10vqlae,"Maybe I missed your comment, but why are you taking HRT?"
10vqlae,"Maybe I missed your comment, but why are you taking HRT?"
10vqlae,Why is getting your period at 54 perplexing? I and others on this sub are in the same boat.
10vqlae,"I stayed on the BCP until 52. I had it in my head that it would keep me looking younger. I only stopped because I was overweight, and that made me more prone to blood clots. It's just my opinion that the periods I was still having were pill-induced, and I probably had gone through meno (without the symptoms because I was getting the hormones from the pills). If your doctor (and your research) isn't worried about you being the BCP at this time (risk factors like smoking etc.) I wouldn't switch yet. I don't know about your case, but my periods were manageable from being on the pill. Some things to think about -The patches have less estrogen, and there's usually an adjustment period while trying different doses. This adjustment period often brings on spontaneous bleeding. I know we can't stay on the BCP forever, but imo do it until it's not safe anymore. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
10vqlae,"MHT/HRT is proven beneficial for those still in peri, not only for symptoms, but also for the preventative benefits for bones, brain and heart health.  

MHT is absolutely for post-meno women as well, because symptoms don't just **stop** at that menopausal date....they can and *do* continue long after.  Even for those without as many symptoms in post-meno, MHT still provides those preventative benefits to heart and bone health."
10vqlae,"The goal of MHT/HRT isn't to regulate hormones so they reach a **certain level**, the goal is to alleviate symptoms, and you know it's the right dose when your symptoms are managed you feel *good* overall."
10vqlae,"HRT in menopause is never doses to blood levels, it is always doses to symptom control.


The definition of what is ‚Äöfull menopause‚Äò and what is peri are completely arbitrary as well. It‚Äôs just a year without periods.

That happens at vastly different levels of ovarian competency in different women. Because it‚Äòs about the uterus response to estrogen mostly.

Uterus highly sensitive to estrogen, and you get periods for a very long time, despite displaying very clear psychological signs of menopause as well as urogenital atrophy.


Also even in menopause sec hormones fluctuate. The cyclic nature continues happening for a veeeery long time.


So no, the cut off between peri and menopause is extremely arbitrary and not based on actual hormone status.

Thus if you experience symptoms, HRT can treat them.


It also increases bone health and reduces cardiovascular health for that matter. When started in perimenopause.

It works better the earlier it is started, rather than forcing someone to go through 5 years of menopause symptoms and bone density loss and then deciding to prescribe it."
10vqlae,"I‚Äôm pretty sure your progesterone flattens earlier in post menopause. And if you have intolerable hot flashes / night sweats (not just the occasional ones), this is a symptom that your estrogen is low. Folks can have low estrogen and not have debilitating hot flashes, which is why the prescription is symptom-based."
10vqlae,"Functionally, yes: it IS the same thing. 

However, oral estrogen + progesterone [the pill] does carry incidentally higher risks of blood clots, stroke, etc. And you have very little choice on the type of estrogen / progesterone IN the actual pill. 

When actual hormone therapy is used instead, you‚Äôre able to choose between oral, transdermal or vaginal estrogen [progesterone is typically administered via the oral route]. And! Both the transdermal + vaginal applications carry virtually zero to an even LOWER risk of blood clots, stroke, etc. What‚Äôs more, these hormones are available in lower doses than the pill. 

So essentially, your provider is denying you a wider variety of hormonal therapy options that also carry fewer associated risks.  

[ps: Someone correct me if this not totally accurate? I‚Äôm fairly self-educated on the topic, thanks to this group + a few well-known doctors, but I do not have practical ‚Äúreal world‚Äù experience with hormone therapy quite yet!]"
10vqlae,"When I asked my provider about HRT and asked how long I had to go without a period before she would consider it, she said no set time at all‚Äîshe starts prescribing it if women want her to as soon as they start having symptoms that bother them enough to bring up at an appointment, even if they still get a period every month.

From the info she told me about, it doesn‚Äôt seem the second part of what your doctor said is necessarily true, or at least not completely. I was told taking BC for (peri)menopause is not necessarily the same thing as other HRT for it and there is less flexibility with maximizing prescription efficacy to meet your specific needs. The doses of the hormones in BCPs are often not the same as in HRT, there are fewer choices in making small changes to the dosing of the estradiol especially, and most BCPs contain progestin not micronized progesterone (the latter is bioidentical structurally to natural progesterone found in the body, the former is not). My GYN gives bioidentical hormones for HRT whenever possible. 

I was on 9 different low dose hormonal birth controls (pill, ring, patch) from my teens to my early 30s and every single one made me depressed, suicidal, and raging for no good reason. Much like I was when I hit full-menopause (and suffered through it for 3-4 years before starting HRT). I‚Äôm now on an estradiol patch .05 mg weekly and micronized progesterone 100 mgs capsules every night. I never experienced those horrible mood problems when I was NOT on hormonal birth control; while I was never in it very long (2-5 months at a time max), trying to stay on it to see if those side effects would ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù was not an option because that‚Äôs how inexplicably nuts and dysfunctional it made me. 

When I was preggers, my doctor put me on micronized progesterone capsules early in my pregnancy as a precaution, and I was terrified of becoming unhinged from it.  But I didn‚Äôt. If anything I felt better. When I requested HRT from my GYN for menopause, I told her about the different reaction I had to birth control pills vs. the micronized progesterone during pregnancy, and she said she suspects that my mood problems from hormonal BC had to do with the synthetic progestin and possibly the higher dose of estrdiol in BC than what she would give me for HRT. She said she‚Äôs seen the same thing many times before. HRT has made my mood sooooo much better. I had asked about BCP vs HRT for menopause because I had some peri friends who were on it for that. The difference between them and me was they were still getting periods and having sex regularly, but they didn‚Äôt want another child, so they needed perimenopause symptom treatment AND contraception. She told me as long as I wasn‚Äôt having sex, was having sexual and might get pregnant but was not opposed to it, or had sex and used another form of reliable contraception if I wanted to prevent it, she usually recommends ‚Äúregular‚Äù HRT for perimenopuase and not BCPs for many reasons (they are below). I didn‚Äôt have a partner and so I agreed we‚Äôd go with that and then if I started having sex again I‚Äôd chose another birth control method, but when she reviewed that I hadn‚Äôt had a period in over 3 years and was 48 years old, she said not to worry about it because she‚Äôd bet all her money I would never get pregnant again even if I tried real hard, that‚Äôs how sure she was.  üòÇ Which, I pretty much figured was the case but it was good to hear it from a doctor.

She explained to me that with HRT for meno as opposed to BCPs, they have more control over finding the correct balance of the dose of estradiol with the dose of progesterone‚Äîthey can change each independent of the other. The BCP doses of estradiol and progestin are a package deal because they are both in one pill. She said adjusting the estradiol to your ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù is usually the primary factor in optimizing symptom control. Also, sometimes adjusting the ratio of estradiol to progesterone can reduce or eliminate any spotting that might occur. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúplay‚Äù with that ratio with BCPs. In addition to that, HRT for (peri)menopause using separate estradiol and progesterone can be prescribed in a continuous or cyclic regimen (i.e., you‚Äôre on estrogen all the time, but some women take progesterone every day whereas other take it cyclically. You don‚Äôt have that choice with BCP‚Äîwhenever you‚Äôre taking the pill, you‚Äôre getting both hormones. That‚Äôs assuming you still have a uterus, which is another potential difference with HRT vs. BCPs for (peri)menopause‚Äîwomen without a uterus can be prescribed estradiol alone and don‚Äôt *have to* take progesterone to prevent excessive thickening of the uterine lining (though some do anyway because it can help a lot with things like sleep). 

Again, this is what my doctor explained to me. I am sure you will hear different things from different people. I think the most important things for any woman going through this is that they are comfortable with and confident in the provider who is treating them, that they give all the information possible (not just the info they feel like giving you or that backs up whatever protocol they usually prefer to give‚Äîdon‚Äôt let them treat you like you‚Äôre the same as every other woman they see), that they *listen* to you and you feel understood, that they are flexible within reason, and that ultimately whatever plan you decide on *together* is meeting your needs. Good luck to all!"
10vqlae,Is he a hormone expert ??
10vqlae,"A few years.  I wish.  For me, this crap started 10 years ago.  Just massively hit in the last 18 months."
10vqlae,Don't wait! I noticed I don't have the energy to take my dog out when it's time to change my patch. This lets me know how much estrogen is helping with my energy and stamina.
10vqlae,[deleted]
10vqlae,"It‚Äòs crazy how much easier T is accessible, when women are always pushed towards antidepressants and other drugs, instead of just being given the hormones the thereof is actually causing the problems.


Funniest thing ever, doc in his 40s here next to the pharmacy I work at is prescribing himself T, but any women not specifically over 50 and 1 year post last period? Nah no can do, you can have venlafaxine."
10vqlae,It‚Äôs not remotely the same. Sorry. We are talking steady decline versus deep plunge

10vqlae,I‚Äôm crying reading this right now. I‚Äôve just started HRT today at almost 3 years post and I am terrified I‚Äôve waited too long.
10vqlae,I'm not.  It's my gyno and she's a bit concerned why I'm still bleeding when I've been on HRT for a year
10vqlae,"I (54) began my HRT today (1mg Estradiol) and I‚Äôm almost 3 years post. Those of you who were smart and did this in peri, you have done yourself a great service! I sure wish I‚Äôd been told by my obgyn that HRT would help and that I didn‚Äôt need to just power through with antidepressants, diet and exercise. But, I found a great doc now and I‚Äôm hopefully on my way to functioning like a somewhat typical human."
10vqlae,"BCP did not work the same as HRT for me. I had *lots* of unpleasant menopause symptoms while on BCP. 

My doc had me stop taking the BCP, waited 2 months, and did a hormone test. Then she prescribed me HRT - currently taking 1 mg estradiol per day. No more hot flashes, night sweats, jagged mood swings, or pee leaks, all of which I had on BCP."
10vqlae,"Well explained. That's what my gyn. said, so I use vaginal estradial."
10vqlae,No just my gyno
10vqlae,"Wow but mine is more  muscle  tiring and weak liftin arms, risin from.chair even openin a can! Its just muscle energy not that im not energetic to do things. Oh gee"
10vqlae,Yes indeed. HRT paired with medical cannabis has helped my sleep tremendously.
10vqlae,The point is. They do. And there are options. And there is no pushback when they want to go on T.
10vqlae,"You can be on low dose testosterone btw, testosterone has the opposite effect of estrogen on breast tissue, and unless you are using it in too large doses it isn‚Äòt converted to estrogen to a relevant degree."
10vqlae,"Blood clot risk is only found when the method of delivery is oral (tablets).  This same risk is not found when the method of delivery is transdermal, ie: patches/gels.  There's links to research about this listed in our Menopause Wiki."
10vqlae,"I know it‚Äôs hard, but try not to worry too much. The worry itself won‚Äôt change anything for the better, anyway. I didn‚Äôt start HRT until early December 2022 (I‚Äôm about to be 49) until between 3-4 years of full menopause, and my GYN told me it will still provide protective benefits. Also, try to keep in mind that the HRT may help with symptoms that get in the way of you doing other good things for your health (low energy, mood, poor sleep) so those will indirectly improve your health if you‚Äôre doing more and taking the best care of yourself that you can. For me, prior to HRT, it was at least 3 full years of no physical or mental energy to do much of anything than the absolute minimum. Within weeks it was like I was a different person (for he better). I do more, exercise, am motivated to shop/cook/eat better, actually get some restful sleep, I actually laugh, smile and even talk to people now‚Äîheck, I even brush my teeth everyday üòÉ Yes, my motivation, mood and energy were so bad that sometimes I skipped brushing my teeth. I was either suicidal or raging Never was before menopause (no mental health history and there was no situational reason for it). So in comparison to exerting the effort to actually go on living, brushing my teeth seemed a little less important. That completely went away in less than a couple weeks of HRT. 

I hope you‚Äôre feeling water soon!"
10vqlae,"Don't worry! I've seen ladies on here start in their sixties, maybe later, I can't remember. You have started now! You're on the road to better health and enjoying more of your life!"
10vqlae,I don‚Äôt want to call her expertise into question but I haven‚Äôt heard anything about HRT stopping menstrual bleeding. Admittedly I‚Äôm only a year or so into peri so may have missed information.

10vqlae,"I mean, it helps with all of that! Taking my dog and doing laundry out requires lots of steps. My thigh muscles, arms (trying to swing them to help get me up the stairsüòÇ), all of that; I feel like climbing mount Everest if I don't have a maximum dose of estrogen at the time. I really want you to be your best you."
10vqlae,Oh I see! Yes true. Patriarchy for you
10vqlae,"Yep - pellets are FDA approved for men, but not for women. I have to use a med spa to get them and pay out of pocket."
10vqlae,Wow thank you SO MUCH for this. What a relief I feel just knowing someone else has the understanding of what I‚Äôm feeling.
10vqlae,I love this! Much is true for me as well! üò≥
10vqlae,I started on low dose and after like 5-6 weeks noticed a big difference. HF dissipated and was slowly getting more energy. Then I had a lull where HF were coming back slightly and she doubled my dose. Now I dont remember when the last time I had a HF was. It‚Äôs helped me so much though!!
10vqlae,Omg.thank u!!! I have a twin sis and she doesnt have this horrible muscle fatigue but i hope hrt helps!! Gona start asap!! Can i msg if i got questions? Ps i have positive Ana and Sjogrens syndrome antibody but none of drs can.say its doin this!! Thumbs hurt so.weak typin ughhh
10vqlae,"Yeah it's a big thing in Hollywood, too. Even for young men. They all want to bulk up a bit and get as ""manly"" as possible. It's a whole thing, almost purely cosmetic."
10vqlae,"NP. Wish I could do more. In addition to HRT, joining this sub has helped me feel sane again‚Äîit‚Äôs also thankfully provided a lot of laughs (I‚Äôm never laughing AT anyone here, always with, because much of the time I‚Äôm actually laughing at myself simultaneously since I‚Äôve experienced some the same stuff. Better than crying! üòâ). 

Oh, and I hope you‚Äôre feeling *better* soon, no feeling *water* soon. Unless feeling water is something that also helps you feel better. Menopause has reduced my desire to proofread before I post."

10vqlae,"I used to wake up in the middle of the night, need to change, and put a towel down and change sheets in the morning. So frustrating. That hasn‚Äôt happened for quite some time. 

I also use a gummy at night with THC in it and that has helped me a lot too. Not sure where you‚Äôre from, but I get mine mail order and my Dr doesn‚Äôt make me get the Medical marijuana card for my state. 

I used to lift weights and run a lot! That went to zero! No interest. Now it‚Äôs coming back since I have been on it too. But I have to work to lose the weight. 

Just give it at least 4 weeks to start noticing a change. Mine was about 5-6 weeks. 

Good luck to you! Why do us girls have to go thru such torture! Lol"
10vqlae,Awww thx!!üòÅ
10obi6s,"Omg doctors have to quit putting the burden of self-diagnosis ON US. 

Check this out: 

>Because of demands on their time, it can be hard for primary care physicians to proactively chat with each of their patients ahead of the perimenopausal years about what to expect, Gorfinkel said.


This is such bullshit! This is part of their JOB! They chose to be primary care physicians, which means they DO spend part of their practice focusing on preventative medicine/health over a wide variety of physiological systems and directing patients to specialists when necessary. Menopause will happen to 50% of their patients, there is NO excuse for not covering it.  

At my 2021 physical my GP said ""Hey you're 50! Happy birthday! Time for your colonoscopy!"" - see, was that so hard? Why would he not have the time to be like ""Hey, you're 40, let's start talking about perimenopause symptoms!"" - that's like 5 minutes. It's bullshit to say they're TOO BUSY to help 50% of their patients with absolutely common health information. 

>Among the barriers to getting help, Gorfinkel said, is outdated information on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms, referred to more recently as menopausal hormone therapy.

And also doctors should be updating their knowledge by reading scientific literature - at least the compiled REVIEWS of research - and not relying on whatever they learned 30 years ago in med school. Presumably they hadn't even sequenced the human genome when half my docs were in school, but that doesn't mean they get to throw their hands up in the air and shrug at you when you tell them you have a genetic mutation that makes you susceptible to cancer. ""Welp, never learned THAT in med school, you can't possibly expect me to help you with it!"""
10obi6s,"Because men don't have to go through this bullshit. That's THE precise, exact, spot-fucking-on reason why there isn't more help for us or zero education about peri or meno. 

When the fuck are we gonna break this cycle & set up the females around the world for success rather than suffering????? Enough is enough."
10obi6s,"This reminds me of  5 years ago when I had pain in my lungs and it took 4 months to finally get a diagnosis of blood clots in my lung. Both my male GP (in his 70's) and a male pulmonologist (in his 60's-ish)  diagnosed pneumonia due to a cloudy spot on my lung seen in an X-ray. After several rounds of antibiotics and several X-rays later I ended up in the emergency room with pain so severe I couldn't breathe. After more x-rays and a CT scan the 30-something female  ER doc said my D-Dimer level was way high, which can be caused by hormonal birth control. She didn't say that the birth control was *causing* the pain or link it to blood clots, but that it could be a ""false positive"" level caused by the medication and to talk to my GP or pulmonologist. No treatment given other than pain meds. I had to go another 3 weeks before I got a second opinion from another pulmonologist (male, 60's) who said I didn't have pneumonia but rather I had blood clots due to the birth control I was taking. After a few more tests to determine that I didn't have any active clots (and was not at immediate risk of dying) and 3 weeks off the birth control, my D-dimer levels were back to normal, my X-ray was clear, and I had no more pain. Though I will always have a nodule on my lung. 

So even though the ER doc saw that my D-dimer levels were up (which is something the first docs didn't think to look for) she didn't connect the dots to blood clots or the BC being the cause of the problem.  Docs often don't think to dig deeper and it's so frustrating, regardless of gender. 

I guess I'm glad that happened because now I know I can't take HRT and I might have had a worse reaction and it might have been riskier."
10obi6s,Lol! Like if they care! If men would go through haft of this hell called ‚Äúmenopause ‚Äú we would have the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù pill invented long long long time ago!
10obi6s,Tell us something we don‚Äôt already know!!!
10obi6s, YES WE DO!!  Keep making boner pills though
10obi6s,I never even heard of perimenopause until in full blown menopause
10obi6s,Which physicians say this? None of mine ever have. >:(
10obi6s,"At the very least, they should have written information available in the rooms Eg. What is menopause? So easy!"
10obi6s,I don‚Äôt know.  I think most husbands of women in perimenopause would love there to be something to relieve the symptoms üòÄ
10obi6s,"My husband is an internist and at their last regional conference they had a NAMS speaker visit and reviewed the new guidelines.  After seeing what bullshit I've been through, he was super excited and relieved to basically have the practice's encouragement to treat perimenopausal women.  

They are being taught that it's *not* just the job of the GYNs, many of whom can also fuck right off with their ignorance.  If some internet rando nurse on Evernow could treat people (ahem...me) using a basic algorithm then our own PCPs are certainly capable of handling it."
10obi6s,"Where do you live that you get an annual physical? My province did away with those decades ago as too expensive. We can no longer access them. GPs are paid for 10 minute appts regardless of how long they spend. Their payments are fixed for 5 years but their office rents, staff, equipment keeep going up so they get a paycut each year. It's not an excuse they don't tell us but there is a reason. Hell, it takes 2 - 3 weeks to book an appt with my gp. The system is falling apart. At least I have a dr. A million people in my area can't get one and without a gp you can't get a mammogram because the cancer agency won't let you have one if there is no dr to send the result to."
10obi6s,"I had previous issues (pre-cancerous cells, had a LEEP, etc) and had to go see my GP regarding some new body changes. I asked him if it could possibly be related to peri menopause, since that‚Äôs started - he insisted very seriously that ‚ÄúNO, this is ABSOLUTELY not possibly related to perimenopause‚Äù.


Yeah, he was very wrong."
10obi6s,"AND often *when we specifically make an appointment to discuss this* they say ‚Äúur dur bReAsT cAnCeR rIsK‚Äù and ‚Äúminimum amount of treatment to manage hot flashes only‚Äù. 

Grrrrrrrr. Still angry about it."
10obi6s,"I don‚Äôt blame the doctors or nurses. They are just cogs in a huge system. Healthcare workers don‚Äôt have the autonomy that they used to. They are employees of hospital systems, insurance companies and the government. Doctors actually get penalized and reprimanded for spending too much time with patients. I also guessing that they have to fight with insurance to get things covered. It‚Äôs a sad system."
10obi6s,"This should be corrected to say they don‚Äôt have time ‚Äî- unless they are willing to reduce their paychecks and see less patients. Doctors have thousands of patients and not time - becuase they gotta have that sweet sweet ‚Äúone %er‚Äù salary 

If they accepted being in the 1.5% or 2% salary club they could do it"
10obi6s,[deleted]
10obi6s,It's misogyny. Men don't want women to be successful.
10obi6s,"My mom had spotting a couple of years after menopause. Since women aren't taught about menopause she thought it was maybe one of those things that just happened. Turns out it's not normal and was a sign of cancer.

It was later diagnosed early enough that she was able to get a hysterectomy and that got rid of it before it spread, and she's 10 years out now. Still, knowing about what's normal and what isn't with our bodies, having it discussed, would be pretty fucking helpful."
10obi6s,"It's also just massively underfunded research -- a result of historically sexist bias in medicine, of course."
10obi6s,"Good God. As a dear friend of mine used to say; ""You must live at the foot of the cross"" to have survived such incompetence. I'm glad you did and thank you for sharing your ordeal."
10obi6s,"My goodness, what an ordeal. Glad it was sorted and hope that you are no longer having issues. We really don‚Äôt get much help from doctors, do we???"
10obi6s,That is horrible!!! I had a PE in 2016. Did you find out if you have a genetic blood disorder?
10obi6s,"My mom almost died from a PE caused in part by BC when she was 35. This is why I‚Äôm not in favor of BC being over the counter, it‚Äôs not as safe as people pretend it is. It‚Äôs absolutely a human right but it should be monitored closely like any other med."
10obi6s,Absolutely!  Especially if you think that men in the same age bracket are at their peak earning years a health issue that effected their mental health and caused memory problems would be front and center at a doctors appt.
10obi6s,"Yes. I remember learning all about puberty as a kid in school.  I‚Äôm pretty health conscious but I still knew very little about peri.  I got on HRT out of sheer luck when I told a friend how crappy I‚Äôd been feeling and she suggested seeing a new doctor. 

My other doctor dismissed symptoms- ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too young‚Äù- and menopausal symptoms are never mentioned in the many health related news and websites I am on regularly."
10obi6s,"Right??? My own (phenomenal) GP needed to figure out some of the issues that came up on a blood test, and the next time I came for an appointment he'd reviewed a few things and had come up with an action plan for me. I don't expect doctors to be omniscient, but to use their education and intelligence to help solve very basic problems that come up. Meno is predictable, expected, and experienced by half the population. It's not a rare disease! I get that there will be some women with medical histories that require a specialist, but for a lot of us it really is a standard decision matrix and the need for information and a bit of professional guidance. So much of it could be summarized and handed to us at a specific age, and then discussed when things start happening.

I love my GP but he definitely sees meno as a specialist issue that gynecologists are experts in. He's wrong, but I get why he thinks that way."
10obi6s,"I live in the US. Annual physicals are part of my insurance. And I don't really care what my GP gets paid, it is his job to address the issues in the time we have together. 

Doctors take an oath, that's why they get paid the big bucks. If they have issues with scheduling, they should address them with their union or employer. If their inattention harms their patients, they aren't doing their jobs. 

I'm sorry your province is so short of doctors that most people lack any medical care whatsoever. Is that Canada?"
10obi6s,Ah hello neighbour. You have to be talking about BC.
10obi6s,That SUCKS!!!
10obi6s,"Good grief, this must be a provincial thing. I‚Äôm in AB and we have access to yearly physicals and I can self refer myself once a year for a screening mammogram. It‚Äôs not perfect, but I try and advocate for myself at every turn. It‚Äôs only going to get worse."
10obi6s,Canadian here...and still get annual physicals.
10obi6s,"No physicals?! That's awful! We still get them yearly in Manitoba.   


What province do you live in? We've often thought of moving elsewhere since the climate here is so cold in winter.. but I want my annual physical, and to be honest, any province that doesn't cover that is less appealing to me."
10obi6s,"Don't forget if you have an issue being told it could be related to your weight!

I'm not sure what they tell women who are neither over nor under weight. That they need to exercise more?"
10obi6s,"Totally heard and agreed. At least for now they still have freedom of speech, and those 10 or 15 minutes can at least be filled with correct information, it doesn't have to be filled with incorrect, outdated or erroneous info. I have a truly fantastic GP (my gynecologists are very sadly all dire) - but my GP can turn 10 or 15 minutes into a goldmine for me. He has a white board in each treatment room and will sketch out ""okay here's your liver and when you take this orally it goes here, then here, then here. When we inject here then it goes there, there and then there. So same outcome, but different route, and in your body this one route isn't absorbing well, so we'll do injections."" He also highlights things on blood tests, links specific blood levels of something to other results to show how they interact and why he is/isn't worried about the numbers based on that interaction. I really love that he understands some patients are more likely to be partners in their own medical care if they have an understanding of why he's recommending something. 

My gyn meanwhile manages to talk more to her nurse than to me and to do a double take as if not expecting me to still be sitting there if I ask a question.  

Anyway, I think some doctors just have the knack of using their 10-15 minutes really effectively. It's sad they have to, I get that they have very little choice in the business side of medicine, but some of them are still really rising to the challenge."
10obi6s,"I do.  They have chosen medicine as a profession.  Not providing basic care is doing patients a huge disservice.  

Yes, time is limited but does that mean they don‚Äôt have to address high blood pressure, diabetes, etc?"
10obi6s,"Except needing a specialist implies an unexpected medical problem arises. Menopause is happening for half the population if they reach middle age.  

Any other issue that effected someone‚Äôs bone health, cardiovascular risk, and mental health would be something primary care doctors would be aware of, menopause is no different."
10obi6s,"It is my primary doctor's job, as you yourself just wrote. Dx, treat, and refer to specialist. GPs must know enough about perimenopause to do each of those things, that's literally what this thread is about - GPs identifying the symptoms in women and referring to a gynecologist. I'm not sure what other jobs there would be than diagnosing, treating and referring to a specialist. That's literally the entire job."
10obi6s,They also don‚Äôt want to pay for their existence
10obi6s,you are ridiculous
10obi6s,"I'm getting a hysterectomy for this in nine days. The only reason I knew to call for an ultrasound when I started bleeding was because I learned that it's total red flag in my medical training.

Your average person does not learn this and can wait years too long before looking into it."
10obi6s,I read an article about that last week & I had no idea we had been excluded from studies like that. JFC no wonder.
10obi6s,Yep. Male normative.
10obi6s,"I feel so, so lucky!"
10obi6s,Yeah me too. It could have been fatal. But I count myself lucky that it was the worst thing I've been through and it came out fine in the end.
10obi6s,I didn‚Äôt. Is that a specific blood test? He said it had a pulmonary infarction which I guess isn‚Äôt as bad as an embolism?
10obi6s,"Wow, I‚Äôm glad she was ok. I was actually only taking it because I had really bad cramps as I was moving into my late 40s, and I was taking it without a break so I wouldn‚Äôt have a period. The problem is that there really aren‚Äôt many other solutions for menstrual problems other than birth control so it‚Äôs harming a lot of women."
10obi6s,"My female gyno was USELESS in helping me, but my male GP saved the day. Go figure!"
10obi6s,"There‚Äòs unfortunately two types of people: those when offered a new problem will do the learning and searching and thus learn new things: they make great medical professionals.

And then you get the larger second group: nah I dunno, let me send this probpem to someone else to fix, I can‚Äòt be bothered.

They make mediocre to shit physicians.



But the same happens at any job.


The person who refuses to remember how to change which printer the print is send to, despite working on the same job and interface for the last decade? 

The one asking for help for the same problem for the 22nd time, while saying ‚Äönah this is just too complicated for me‚Äò


It‚Äòs just weaponised incompetence in every area of life. Not just in household chores.





But especially with physicians (or my job as a pharmacist) university and residency cannot ever teach you all there is to know, even if research didn‚Äòt continue after you became an MD. There‚Äôs just too much information.

What the education does is lay the groundwork, so someone like your Gyn can quickly read up on research and treatment guidelines and understand those fully/ being able to reach the correct conclusions from them.

It‚Äòs when they refuse to use that educational basis to build up on it, especially when it is part of their speciality is just so foreign to me. Is this really just snoring Job for money with no emotional investment for them?"
10obi6s,"Yes, Canada. Province is like a state. They don't really get paid ""the big bucks"" here by the time they pay overhead. There is a major dr shortage here and in much of the world. The result is care has become reactionary not preventative. Drs are not paid at all for a lot of paperwork and things. However, we don't get charged for acute care, no such thing as hospital bills or copays. The population is growing too fast for everyone to have a dr and drs are retiring in droves and new ones not surprisingly don't want to work for free, so you get your appt for 10 mins and that's it. This is a Canadian news piece and reflectsthe system here  - no physicals, dr shortage, long waits, short appts, lots of work drs not paid for."
10obi6s,Doctors in the US don‚Äôt have unions!
10obi6s,"While I am indeed, the shortage is across the country. The new physician master agreement will compensate for some complex care but you're not getting a physical!"
10obi6s,Once a year for a mammogram? We are only allowed screening every 2 unless there is an issue. I wish care was standardized across the country.
10obi6s,"Same, my kids too with annual blood work."
10obi6s,What province? I need to get out of this flaming dumpster aka BC. I haven't had a physical in decades.
10obi6s,Loool‚Ä¶if you work for a corporation in the US do you really think there is freedom of speech? Since healthcare workers work for hospital corporations now they really don‚Äôt have ‚Äúfreedom of speech.‚Äù Personally you may have freedom of speech however there are so many people that get terminated because of things that that they say on social media or wherever. The majority of states are ‚Äúat will‚Äù states. You can be let go for any reason unless your state offers additional protection and/or there is written company policy but good luck proving it.
10obi6s,"I‚Äôm a nurse, and I chose the profession because I naively wanted to help people! I work within a system that literally prevents me from doing that safely or thoroughly or even well. It‚Äôs distressing and many of us want a different career now. 

Believe me when I say docs and nurses are victims of this whole thing too!"
10obi6s,no
10obi6s,Yet they couldn‚Äôt exist without us
10obi6s,"What a weird thing to say. As though women can't make their own money, wtf."
10obi6s,There are certain genetic blood disorders that makes one more susceptible to clotting. Factor V Leiden is one as is Factor 2 also known as Prothrombin G20210A. I have Factor 2. Are you on blood thinners?
10obi6s,"Oh yeah, it's a huge problem. I've had horrifically painful periods since puberty and have basically zero options aside from risking hormonal BC, which I won't do. I have a non-hormonal copper IUD that's been in place over 5 years."
10obi6s,"I just got a recommendation from a mid life nurse in the hallway of a new PCP visit for a gyno that doesn't do OB and helped her with MHT. I'm so excited! My old PCP was ready to help me but she quit right after I got some other things stabilized, it was tragic."
10obi6s,Some do. The Doctors at many VA Hospital are unionized.  I don‚Äôt work in the private sector so I‚Äôm not sure about them.
10obi6s,"Yes, the medical system across the country is collapsing. Your description sounded especially specific to BC though. I work at BC Cancer and have been witnessing the collapse from the inside. It's utterly depressing. Staff shortages across the board (not just doctors and nurses) due to burnout are making things even worse."
10obi6s,"Children can get them. Adults no, unless the dr essentially makes a reason for it and then you still have pay in bc at least. If there is a chronic condition there is monitoring. It's less than ideal. This may vary somewhat by province as provinces make their own rules regarding health care delivery."
10obi6s,BC too.
10obi6s,And once menopause hits we have outlived our usefulness.
10obi6s,"Yes! and it's that dependency that scares them. What do men do when they get scared? They get angry and lash out. Not that women don't but it is more of a male trait. In general, they tend to be more Fight and we lean towards Flight. My extremely large boyfriend doesn't understand why I literally run when he loses his temper and starts yelling at me."
10obi6s,Men don‚Äôt want women to be successful & they also don‚Äôt want to pay for their existence‚Ä¶
10obi6s,"Agree, that‚Äôs misogynist af"
10obi6s,"No. My pulmonologist (the second, competent one) felt pretty confident that it was just the birth-control that caused it. I went off of it, my d-dimer level went down, and I haven‚Äôt had any problems since."
10obi6s,"Has that helped? By the time I got all of this figured out, I was only six months away from my last period anyway, so that‚Äôs been a relief. My gyn  thinks I had adenomyosis, but it‚Äôs too hard to diagnose to be sure."
10obi6s,"When you say VA, do you mean the Veterans Administration or Virginia?"
10obi6s,"Yep, it's awful. People are dying. 2 years in bc no paps! Took 4 months for my result due to backlog. I work with several arms of healthcare and it's terrible. The govt also knew it was coming for years  but did nothing to meaningfully address it."
10obi6s,That's too bad. My kids are 17 and 19 and our family doctor called us a couple of times even during lockdown to make sure we were all feeling well and to address any health concerns. We are in Manitoba.
10obi6s,"My daughter is almost 13 and she has only seen a family doctor 3 times through a walk-in since there are no family doctors taking patients. I wish I could get her a physical and someone to monitor her current health conditions properly! Seriously people, don't move to BC if you value your health."
10obi6s,"I'm confused why we no longer get any pelvic exams after menopause. Things do tend to fall apart quite literally as we get older. Why is the health of our sex organs suddenly so unimportant? Until the magical age of 50, I was hounded to get my annual gyn exams. They will probably say that they will continue to do exams ""as needed"" when a woman reports a problem. Many older women are reluctant to bring up problems ""down there""."
10obi6s,üíØ
10obi6s,Why are you just repeating yourself? That's a disgusting attitude my friend.
10obi6s,It's misogynist to state what misogynists think?
10obi6s,Thank you
10obi6s,Good news. All the best!!!
10obi6s,"No, the copper IUD often makes periods worse actually, though I noticed no difference. The only thing that actually made my periods better was anorexia because they stopped (I'm recovered now)."
10obi6s,"Sorry, didn‚Äôt even think about it possibly being Virginia. It‚Äôs the Veterans Administration."
10obi6s,"Yeah I recently waited 4 months for a pap result then 2 more months for a colposcopy that showed precancerous CIN2, and another month for LEEP. I was fortunate not to have cancer. Those poor women that do though.."
10obi6s,Your family doctor sounds absolutely wonderful!
10obi6s,"Yep. My 80 year old mother had to travel for a knee replacement and they thankfully found a blood disease she has, along with scary high blood pressure. All the specialists here say she needs a gp to montor her so she does not have stroke or heart attack and the only thing we get told when we say she doesn't have one and can they help her is 'sorry but she absolutely needs that and it's not my area so not going to help.'  Horrible."
10obi6s,I was wondering about this very thing the other day! I went into menopause early at 39 and they haven't mentioned a pap smear since.
10obi6s,"Also ovarian cancer is such a silent killer. Every woman should be covered by insurance for an annual ultrasound to check for ovarian cancer. When the dr shoves their fingers up there to try to palpate the ovaries, apparently that's a pretty crappy method in trying to detect it. (Also it f\*cking hurts. Why are we expected to suffer?) It's also too far gone if they even manage to detect it that way. We get scans on our breasts every year -- we should be getting ovarian scans annually too."
10obi6s,"When you DO bring up problems, they are largely ignored."
10obi6s,"Lol. You aren‚Äôt my friend. I don‚Äôt even know you & you don‚Äôt know me. I don‚Äôt appreciate you trying to insult me. You are a die hard feminist. Good for you. What I was saying wasn‚Äôt anything against your beliefs. The fact of the matter is that women are often paid less than men. The types of jobs they have usually paid less even though they are often more important‚Ä¶such as caregiving. Yet the government is full of mostly men who don‚Äôt want to put any money into things like social services or helping people‚Ä¶fields that contain mostly women.

Many men have wives or live in girlfriends who help pay the rent yet men don‚Äôt want women to be successful. They don‚Äôt want to fund things like social services or caregiving services that are mostly staffed by women. They don‚Äôt want to increase taxes on men who have too much so they can use some of it for this type of thing."
10obi6s,"No, it didn‚Äôt come off like that‚Äôs what it was‚Äîit sounded like a defensive man to me"
10obi6s,Weird that there so many downvotes. Did I misinterpret something or are there dude bros hanging out in the menopause sub?
10obi6s,"I'm sorry you're dealing with that. Friends who have Mirena and say it's made it so much better, but I guess that's the wrong type for you."
112furq,"I didn‚Äôt get Pap smears for about 20 years because I was low risk. No HPV, same sexual partner, no history of abnormal Pap smears. I was fine! Now in menopause, I am getting them again. They detected a benign polyp in the exam that I didn‚Äôt know I had. I prefer to stay safe and healthy."
112furq,"As someone who has a 73 year old Aunt who just had surgery and now chemo and radiation for a reproductive system cancer, i really do not recommend stopping Paps. If she hadn't been getting hers, she never would have had a chance by the time the cancer was noticeable."
112furq,Best of luck to you.
112furq,We still need Pap smears after menopause
112furq,"Interesting.  I'm in Ontario, Canada and I don't think they stop recommending them here!    I'll have to ask my doctor next year!"
112furq,100% still doing pap smears as recommended. No need to skip if you've still got your cervix.
112furq,"Last Pap smear? Isn‚Äôt it recommended to continue paps past menopause? 
You mention personal choice for yourself, I‚Äôm curious why you have continued to get paps up until now? Why stop just because of menopause?"
112furq,"Yup. I'm all finished with menopause symptoms, officially post-menopausal. Saw my gyn last week, negative pap smear, negative HPV. No more pap smears!!!!!! WoooooOOO!

And before anyone questions this. I have been with my gynecologist for over 25 years. I trust her implicitly. She explained all the research to me and it makes total sense to me. I feel so happy to be DONE with this chapter!"
112furq,Interesting!!
112furq,I would rather have a blood test like they have developed for Prostate cancer
112furq,That sounds delightful. Go you!
112furq,"Huh. I am so oblivious to time. I was going along having my annual paps until one year they said, Well, we stop taking regular paps at your age. You can have it done if you want to pay $600.00 but otherwise, we don't do it. 

I think that I was 60 at the time, and I haven't had one since. I'm 64 now. Never had HPV. Never had anything but negative pap results.

I had an annual last October, and they didn't take one then. I'm in the US. I feel stupid for not asking about it now, I always trusted that they did everything that is required. I had no idea when the yearly rule stopped at a certain age. 

Luckily, I never felt uncomfortable having the test."
112furq,I concur with others here that the post implies that post menopause women don‚Äôt need paps. Paps are a moment of discomfort to literally save lives. I won‚Äôt stop. People are getting reproductive cancers at any age.
112furq,Congrats!  You've obviously taken very good of yourself.  Be blessed as you continue to do so in new ways!üíú
112furq,"I know PAPs can be very uncomfortable, but I am not clear as to why you would not want one. Is it the discomfort of the exam?"
112furq,I had a pap recently and was the roughest most painful ever. The practical nurse went overboard with cranking open the speculum.  I complained to the regular nurse afterwards. Not sure what else to do?
112furq,"Op, have Pap smears always been painful for you? Is that why you are relieved to not having them done anymore?"
112furq,Do you have to pay for paps where you live? I‚Äôm in Canada and paps are covered by our healthcare system.
112furq,"I do my preventative screenings, and paps in my age group are recommended once every 3 years, plus they are covered under insurance. I figure I have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
112furq,All good. Everyone does exactly what they want to do. Glad you're all good! Here's to the best of everything in the years to come. ‚ù§Ô∏è
112furq,"I trust my doctor and her reasoning. There are a lot of reasons I am not terribly concerned. 1.) I do not have HPV and never have. 2.) I am not and will never be on HRT, and 3.) I have zero family history.

My lifestyle and risks are miniscule. I am not concerned. Everyone else can do whatever they feel best, but after having a very in-depth discussion with my doctor of decades and having done my own research and talking to other medical specialists I feel fine with not having them.

And I am also wondering if your aunt had cervical cancer. Pap smears *only detect cervical cancer.* Other women's reproductive system cancers *are not* detected by pap smear."
112furq,Thanks! I'm pretty happy about it....
112furq,You can. I won't unless I have some compelling reason.
112furq,From Cancer Care Ontario: You can stop regular screening with Pap tests at the age of 70 if you have had 3 or more normal tests in the previous 10 years.
112furq,"I'm definitely post-menopausal, so that was a big part of it. That, and a consistent negative HPV test result over the years."
112furq,"All good. As a woman I am stoked I have choices and can see to my own health exactly as I see fit, as do you!"
112furq,"I'm so done. Like, crispy on both sides *done.*

I've covered all of this and more throughout this thread. You all have a wonderful evening."
112furq,Can you please link the research?
112furq,I did not know there was a finish line for pap smears! How exciting!
112furq,"Wait, I‚Äôm post meno too. You mean we do not get Pap smears anymore? I thought post was every 3 years?"
112furq,"Yeah, I'm expecting the peanut gallery to go at me here. According to my very capable gynecologist testing negative (multiple times) for HPV leaves me with *incredibly low/nil* chance of cervical cancer. I'll take it.

Still need mammograms, but one less thing on the crap pile.

***I should add that I did not have any HRT. I think that if you do you do need pap smears going forward. Still researching that, though, so if anyone has more info please post."
112furq,"It's interesting. I mean I would have no problem getting them if my gyn told me I should, but she was like, ""This HPV test comes back negative and you can say goodbye to pap smears."" I was so surprised! I guess I figured they just kept on going forever.

I don't think it's a hard and fast rule when they stop, but I am well into post-menopause. She's seen me the whole time (long before that as well, she was also my OB when I had my last child 20+ years ago), listened to me gripe for *years* about my symptoms which quite honestly took me by surprise, especially the panic and anxiety attacks. Never had them before menopause. She gave me all my options and while I didn't always like them I appreciated her honesty. She also told me that it would eventually pass and the whole timing of that was wildly individual depending on the woman.

I'm 54. No period for almost 4 years. One day it just stopped, never anything after that. Symptoms continued until about a year ago....slowly decreased until they're pretty much non-existent. Once in a great while the panic attacks roll around, but they aren't as intense as they used to be. I honestly think that's just a result of all the weird crap happening in the world these days."
112furq,"And that's fantastic. You make your own choices as I do.

Part of the freedom of choice, especially for women, is the freedom to do what they feel is best for *themselves* with their healthcare. I don't tell anybody else how to conduct themselves in regards to their health choices. 

I share my experience. I do not expect others to choose what I choose. Women choose what's best for them on an individual basis. That's exactly as it should be."
112furq,"Thank you! Yes, I have worked to keep on top of things. Peri and Menopause weren't a walk in the park for sure, but grateful to be on the other side of it.

I just thought paps were forever, so I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't. At least in my particular case."
112furq,"My gynecologist told me I didn't need to do them anymore. No risk factors, no HPV, no need. If you do your own research being HPV positive is the main predictor for cervical cancer. Pap smears *do not* detect other women's reproductive cancers such as uterine or ovarian."
112furq,"I'm so sorry. I've had a few occasions where it went like that. It seemed to me to be the staff, maybe they just aren't that competent?"
112furq,Because I trust my doctor when she says it's not needed. And I am confident in my personal decision going forward. I'm not asking for advice.
112furq,"I have amazing health care coverage (unlike so many Americans) and it's covered completely. But again, if I don't need them I see zero reason to have them done."
112furq,I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine too. Are they doing a vaginal exam? Just no pap?
112furq,">2.) I am not and will never be on HRT

To clarify, HRT does not increase cervical cancer risk.  In fact HRT has a protective effect.
 
[Hormone replacement therapy and cervical cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33236658/)"
112furq,"My aunt also never had HPV, and we have almost no cancer in my family. 

Yes, everyone can do what's best for them but I don't think you should be so hellbent on trying to prove your point. There's no harm in continuing to get a PAP and it's misleading to suggest that after menopause it's not something you need to do anymore. 

My aunt is an otherwise incredibly healthy, active and ""young"" 70 year old. There were no obvious risk factors. I'm so thankful she was still having her PAPs done because we love her so much, and she still has so much more life left to live!"
112furq,It checks for cancer.   Which is pretty important.
112furq,Lol I‚Äôm post meno but long way from 70! Guess we still have them here for awhile yet!
112furq,I'm just not sure why you would conclude they arent necessary or advised anymore. If you have a cervix.
112furq,https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/hpvscreeningpredictor
112furq,There‚Äôs not.   This is not recommended at all.
112furq,"I didn't either! I was pretty stoked about the info. I'm sure like everything else there are differing opinions, but I trust my doctor. She's been great."
112furq,It is usually every 3 years recommended post-menopausal for women who have never had a positive result. I'm not even in my 50s yet if my doc wanted to stop pap smears entirely I would probably get another doctor.
112furq,My gynecologist told me that if my last test for HPV came back negative I was done. I have never taken HRT or have a family history.
112furq,"I wouldn‚Äôt go at you! I was getting them every 5 years too and was a welcome break. My only advice is to keep an eye out for atrophy and it‚Äôs symptoms. I was diagnosed with it around year 3- 2 years earlier than my scheduled pap. 

I‚Äôm back to yearly now because I‚Äôm on HRT"
112furq,"This sounds totally sensible to me, but I‚Äôm no expert."
112furq,"Yeah, 54 is about when mine stopped as well. I was put on bc then, and over my lifetime, whenever I was on it my flow was cut down. By that time, I had almost none so I really have no definite time. 

I do think all the crap happening in the world has definitely had an impact. My therapist confirms it."
112furq,"You can share your experience, but words count."
112furq,I understand you weren‚Äôt asking for advice. I also know lots of women experience pain during them. But if your doctor is still going to give you a pelvic exam every year then is it the small pricking part that you are relieved to stop doing?
112furq,"Very true. The increase is in cases of breast cancer, not cervical cancer. I am confident that women on HRT are safe. We *all* have some risk of cancers based on all kinds of factors.

My doctor was pretty up-front about continuing the pap smear if I was to choose HRT. I am not sure what her reasoning is. But if I was on it I would do as she said."
112furq,"It's not at all misleading. It's definitely a choice and one that in my gynecologist's opinion is not an unwise thing to do if you meet the criteria I do.

I realize that we all try and do the best we can for our health, but where I am at I am thrilled not to have to do them anymore. I am not advocating for anyone else, talk to your doctor and make your own choice. Personally speaking I wasn't going to keep this to myself just because others weren't comfortable receiving the information. If you don't appreciate it, move on."
112furq,"It's not as if I won't be going into get my regular check-ups and all that....I am pretty vigilant regarding my health. Pap smears won't detect other cancers, but my doctor will keep seeing me as I move through the next phases of my life."
112furq,Got that. Testing negative for HPV over multiple decades leaves me at miniscule risk. Not worried.
112furq,While looking that up I also see that those who have had a hysterectomy but kept their cervix also still need to continue screening until they are 70. Dang!!
112furq,"Oh, so what you mean is you're substituting an alternate method of HPV test for a pap test, not that you're no longer getting tested. This link says being hpv negative is ""predictive for three years"" - so by never getting a pap again, you mean you are instead getting screened with an HPV test every three years in place of a pap. That makes a lot more sense than not being screened at all, and should probably have been front and center in the post."
112furq,"I think it depends on the doctor, your medical history, the guidelines where you live, and your insurance plan. My doctor says it doesn't matter than I'm menopausal she still wants the pap done every 3 years minimum (I've never had a positive result) and for me 3 years is better than every year so I'm cool with that."
112furq,"I‚Äôm 45. Last year I was told every 3 years. Ok cool. And I know everyone has a different experience but I had a child and I‚Äôm had IUD, a Pap smear isn‚Äôt a big deal for me. A mammogram feels a bit more uncomfortable but I still get them yearly."
112furq,"Divorced my entire reproductive system due to a borderline ovarian tumor despite being extremely low risk for cancer and my OB still does paps because cervical cells can be left behind. Even if rare, the three seconds it takes during the exam is worth it to me.  Vaginal wall cancer is another thing. He's all up my business checking for prolapse and atrophy anyway so I'm good with an occasional swab."
112furq,"I hear you. I plan on keeping a close eye on feeling like something isn't right and being proactive for sure.

Helps that I don't have a family history of cervical cancer, too."
112furq,"I had zero idea about this, thought I'd share and hopefully give other ladies something to look forward to! Gotta find the bright spots."
112furq,"This sub of *ALL* subs is a place to share experiences and bullying people who have differing views is *not* and acceptable way to have useful conversations about our current health issues. It's very simple to hear other people's experiences and keep scrolling. 

Just leave it alone already. People can make choices you don't agree with based on discussions with their doctor. Those same people can share that with others."
112furq,"Lol. Every year? I don't think they give old ladies pelvic exams every year, but ok. I've been taking care of my health for many decades now, I'm sure I know how going into the future.

I'm not getting into the weeds on this with anyone. I'm happy to take care of myself, you take care of you. Life is good."
112furq,As long as there is a balance between testosterone and progesterone and anastrazol to prevent the estrogen becoming the not so good one.  Estradiol is the safe one .
112furq,The title with no content would suggest that it isn‚Äôt necessary. People come here to share advice on life in menopause so someone could be mislead by that. Doesn‚Äôt do any harm to just add a bit of extra context in the post.
112furq,"The reason we get paps is there generally are very few symptoms of cervical cancer until it has progressed to dangerous levels. If detected early the survival rate is quite high, while later detection (after you feel symptoms) the prognosis is much worse. The risk of cancer increases with age. Which means you'll simultaneously be stopping the screening that would allow you to catch cancer in its early stages and entering an age in which it is more likely you'll develop cancer. 

I would be incredibly cautious around a doctor who was on board with stopping cancer screening at the cusp of the most risky lifestage for cancer."
112furq,As someone who had a rarer kind of breast cancer at 33 and would have considered myself minuscule risk I‚Äôm still glad I took my symptoms seriously and got checked. Sadly someone has to be people in the short odds end of the spectrum with cancer.
112furq,That doesn‚Äôt sound like a good doctor. The guidelines in the US are every FIVE years (not 3) and HPV testing is better than pap testing.
112furq,Thank you!
112furq,">I don't think they give old ladies pelvic exams every year, but ok.

What's your definition of ""old ladies""? I'm in my 50's and still have an annual pelvic with a pap q3y. My mother didn't stop until she was in her 70's."
112furq,"Pretty sure there's plenty of content in my posting here. Nothing misleading here, came here to share my joy. Certainly not advising anyone, just stoked being me."
112furq,The fact that I tested negative for HPV for many years is the biggest factor in my decision. I'm very happy with my decision going forward.
112furq,Same! (Tnbc?) No breast cancer in any of my female relatives either. My risk was so low that my Dr didn't even recommend I get a mammogram when I found the lump ...she told me to come back if it got bigger.
112furq,Me as well. No one in my family. So glad I continue to get my tests.
112furq,It‚Äôs every year to 3 in the U.K. and NZ so I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre a bad doctor.
112furq,I'm in my 50's and it's every 3 years.
112furq,Maybe you could have said your ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô menopause milestone? Just thoughts for next time.
112furq,"Great, since other women read this thread it's also good for them to read the medical advice, which definitely goes against your choice."
112furq,Yes! I had two lumps that felt like they turned up over night! Luckily my doctor seen me on the day of discovery and sent me for scans 3 days later and then the whirlwind started. I‚Äôm so glad she didn‚Äôt think I was too young and put me off as I was stage three already.
112furq,Lol. No.
112furq,üíïüíïI'm glad you are ok! I'm going on 9 years now but sadly too many young women due from this type of breast cancer!
112furq,"Okay I wasn‚Äôt going to call you out. But your blatant stubbornness to accept others fair opinions on this post is a shame. This response just removed any of my empathy for you. You‚Äôre rude, and I believe wrong. Bye."
112furq,I‚Äôm still in the middle of treatment going on 12 month already. It‚Äôs been fucking terrible! I‚Äôve had such bad luck. I won‚Äôt be finished til middle of this year all going well fingers crossed. I only hope I can be ‚Äòcured‚Äô or in ‚Äòremission‚Äô for as long as you! Hearing people who have struggled through it and are still ‚Äòwell‚Äô in a sense is inspiring. Thanks for sharing!
112furq,This whole riffraff argument is totally ridiculous. Everyone stop it.
112furq,"Sorry, but I get tired of sharing *opinions* and occasionally *happy occasions* like my post here and being policed by folks who could just scroll on by. People post things. You might not like the content. That's just how it goes."
112furq,"Agh. I'm sorry you're in the thick of it. Going through treatment is the worst!!!! Chemo, surgery then radiation? Has the chemo shrunk your tumor yet?"
10q4ahp,"I have to order things frequently. Ups, post office, Amazon, fed ex. Fed ex is the only one that consistently fucks it up over and over. Whenever I see something went out fed ex I‚Äôm so annoyed"
10q4ahp,Can I ask the important question?  What moisturizer did you order? Asking for a friend. üòÇ
10q4ahp,"Huh. Amazon lost my ""organic vulva balm"" as well!! 
When I called and gave them the order number and the customer service rep read out what it was, I was trying so hard not to lol. Then I realized that more than likely has has no idea what a vulva is."
10q4ahp,üòÇ sorry I had to laugh.
10q4ahp,"Last time I had to call Amazon was when the delivery of my vibrator went missing. Late at night,  I panic thinking that someone in my town,  who knows me,  got the box with my name on it. 

It was super fun having this discussion with a guy who didn't share the same native language as me. But, I got my refund in the end - they are expensive. 

My sympathies."
10q4ahp,"FedEx does this shit in my area. I go out of my way to avoid them now, and avoid buying from websites that ship via FedEx. lol Fortunately I haven‚Äôt been this betrayed by Amazon. Yet."
10q4ahp,"This was the best post ever. Epic story. Epic comments. I need to save this for when I need a laugh again. 

Ok in all seriousness. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. But damn this is so funny. Hugs."
10q4ahp,"Stupid question perhaps, but how do you really know if your vulva is in need of moisturizing?"
10q4ahp,"Sharoof!  The newest recruit to the Menopause Army! After work he did some googling and is now loud and proud on our behalf.

10q4ahp,You‚Äôre braver than I am.  I would have said ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù and just bought a new tube.  I‚Äôm not explaining that shit to Sharoof!
10q4ahp,My apartment neighbor received my package with lube in it - and he opened it!
10q4ahp,Why did Sharoof tell you to call again? That's just bad customer service.
10q4ahp,"in a pinch, so long as you don't have allergies, coconut oil feels good. just don't use as a lube for sex as it wrecks latex and can lead to broken condoms."
10q4ahp,Fuck Amazon! I'm so sick of them & their bullshit.
10q4ahp,Grrrrrr....off with his........yeah.
10q4ahp,"Bahahahahaha, meno peeps are the funniest!"
10q4ahp,Is it gynatrof??
10q4ahp,"I saw delivery, vaginal, and Amazon and thought someone needed a sex-ed class.  LOL!"
10q4ahp,"I guess there's something to be said after all about living in the middle of nowhere and having to pick up orders from the post office in the nearest town (almost everything gets handed off to Canada Post here, no matter who the original shipper was... The odd thing gets hand delivered by BNI)"
10q4ahp,"Have not tried, but have heard coconut oil is good.  YMMV."
10q4ahp,Sorry for your troubles but what did you buy?? I too have a desert vadge. üò©
10q4ahp,Really illustrates that wired article about the enshittification of tech companies. Misdelivering sensitive items with no care that it's sensitive is prime. I hope you find a non enshittified company for next time.
10q4ahp,"I needed this hilarious post almost as much as you needed your cream, lol."
10q4ahp,"Vulvacare is fantastic. I love that stuff. I like it better than Magic V, which was my go to before I discovered Vulvacare.  Big thanks to Sharoof for taking care of business."
10q4ahp,"FedEx once failed to deliver a yoga mat despite many phone calls trying to get them to do it. When I decided I didn't actually want the yoga mat that bad and called the retailer, they called FedEx to ask what happened.

FedEx straight up LIED to them about what happened."
10q4ahp,YES! FedEx is the worst.
10q4ahp,"There is a long-running joke about the Fedex hub in my city being a black hole, and nobody thinks its funny anymore"

10q4ahp,"Not the OP, but if you suffer from vaginal dryness internally, Revaree (non prescription, non hormonal, not from Amazon) by a company called Bonafide has been life changing for Sahara vagina me."
10q4ahp,‚ÄúVulvacare.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen it recommended a few times. It‚Äôs more for external dryness and itchiness. I also have internal dryness and ordered something else for that (forget the name of it). I‚Äôve been doing estrogen inserts but my Rx ran out and my ladyparts have staged a rebellion. I need something to get me through to my next OB appointment.
10q4ahp,I‚Äôm asking too.
10q4ahp,I'm on HRT now but prior to that I used Vulvacare externally (it's an ointment) and BioNourish internally.
10q4ahp,"""Sharoof, you know the lingam and the yoni? This is a very important part of the yoni."""
10q4ahp,"Lol me too. I mean, of all the things to misdeliver. I hope the good soul who received it either returns it or gets a laugh when they open it. Sharoof was very earnest on the phone. ‚ÄúYou have been a longtime Amazon Prime customer and I understand how this situation must be distressing for you.‚Äù Yes. Yes, it is."
10q4ahp,sharoof sounds like a good dude. :D
10q4ahp,lol
10q4ahp,"It‚Äôs itchy, fellow hockey fan, and irritated and feels dry. Doesn‚Äôt feel like a yeast infection. Ran out of estrogen inserts about two weeks ago and the hoo-ha rebellion flared up about a week ago. So I figure it needs some moisture down there. 

I miss my days of Niagara Falls-level lubrication that I had down there. I remember my mom used to have products for dryness in the bathroom drawer and I always thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôll never be an issue for ME.‚Äù Of course, I was also the same teenager who once quite earnestly asked my mom and aunt, ‚ÄúWhat is cellulite?‚Äù and they just laughed."
10q4ahp,You‚Äôll know‚Ä¶trust us.
10q4ahp,I realized when sex became painful & regular lube didn't help
10q4ahp,"Amazon used to have some of the best customer service I'd ever encountered. The more profitable the company became, the worse the customer service got.

In 2014, someone reporting this issue would have gotten another tube sent out immediately, a refund for purchase price and shipping fee, and a month added to their Prime subscription. And could have done so by reporting the item misdelivered on the website - no phone calls required, much less multiple calls."
10q4ahp,To get refunded the $3 in extra shipping fee I paid for overnight delivery when I was in misery.
10q4ahp,The fellow vagina owners over at r/healthyhooha say coconut oil is a big no no. It can disrupt your flora because it‚Äôs antibacterial. My gyno said vanicream face lotion is acceptable in a pinch.
10q4ahp,"I‚Äôve had success with Gynatrof. By the way for anyone interested I discovered a much better price than Amazon at Well.ca, in Canada. Sorry don‚Äôt know about outside Canada."
10q4ahp,Vulvacare. Works great so far (for external itching/irritation only)
10q4ahp,"They also creeped on my personal blog post about it, trying to blame the retailer for requiring a signature instead of owning up to being incompetent liars."
10q4ahp,Several times I‚Äôve had them report it as lost and then one day after I file with the company who sent it to get another one shipped it magically arrives.

10q4ahp,He was!
10q4ahp,I remember those days. I've talked to different departments and different countries so much. I've explained things to different employees who were telling me wrong information and then transferred again. Their model is train each department so specifically to not have any more information than absolutely positively necessary. Then when the shooting spree is being planned is being planned they get the big boss who fixes everything in five minutes. Amy Schumer did a great skit about not this entirely but same general feeling. I started crying a few weeks ago after two hours.
10q4ahp,Oh ffs Sharoof.
10q4ahp,I don't think it's a huge no no. I've had probably a dozen doctors suggest it and lots of ladies I know use it. I think it can cause problems for some hoo-ha owners but for most it's fine. I find some of the posts there a little extreme.
10q4ahp,"i just dont think its THAT strong of an antibacterial. so maybe if you used it regularly, but i also see foks recommending it for this purpose. i suppose everyones hooha is different. def going to check out this other sub though."

10q4ahp,You guys are my people. ü§£ü§£
10q4ahp,He was a guy.üòÇ He was very kind!
10q4ahp,this is how we know we're old. :/
10q4ahp,"aww, ive been so frustrated with customer service lately. sorry to hear you had a bad time. ill have to look up the Amy Schumer skit. she gets a lot of hate but she definitely calls it."
10q4ahp,I mean yeah we are all different for sure but I hate vagina problems with a passion so I try to be as careful as I can as to not irritate the finicky little bitch. ü§£
10q4ahp,"""Hi, I'm Sarah and while I work for FedEx, I'm replying as just another person. This wouldn't have happened if the seller hadn't insisted on requiring a signature, so really it's on them.""

""Sarah"" happily ignored the part of the post where I knew I was going to need to sign, was waiting inside for FedEx, who left a ""sorry we missed you"" tag on the door without actually ringing the frigging doorbell. Yeeaaaaah, the driver being a LYING LIAR is absolutely the yoga mat people's fault and not the lying liar's.

To this day, if I'm expecting a package that I need to sign for and have made plans to be home to receive it, I put a my big note on my door:

**DEAR FEDEX-** 

**I AM HOME; PLEASE RING BELL!!!!!**"
10q4ahp,"That is just about the nicest thing anybody has said to me! Thank you! Maybe in another life, I'd have been a writer, but in this life, I just like to play with words."
10q4ahp,"Wow! Thank you! I'm gettin a big ol Buddy Ebson head, over here!"
10q4ahp,I think they meant the unsuspecting package opener. üòâ But I could be wrong‚Ä¶peri brain has done me wrong lol.
10q4ahp,"I don't follow her around or anything but she has solid skit work and a movie I enjoyed. I think it's just the hate anyone on TV that is funny that identifies as female. Whatever the do, it's never enough."
10q4ahp,its prob good you have a discerning hooha. :)
10q4ahp,Same - lying liars. They claimed they left my package with the receptionist. I live in a house with no reception. Then the next time they claimed the gate was locked and they needed a code. I had the customer service representative pull up Google maps. Asked them to put in my address and look at street view and tell me if they saw either a gate or anything that remotely looked like something that needed a code anywhere within a mile of my house. I think that particular package took six tries.
10q4ahp,"nice! redonculous, but very smart of you!"
10q4ahp,"Oh my gosh, the same shit has happened to me with fed ex. Most of the time when I order stuff it‚Äôs Amazon or comes through USPS. 90% of the times I‚Äôve ordered something and it‚Äôs delivered via fed ex they do the same thing. It‚Äôs infuriating finding those tickets and 100% knowing they never knocked, especially when it‚Äôs happened multiple times on the same item"
10q4ahp,That‚Äôs so infuriating. I was once waiting ALL day for an immunotherapy cancer medication that I have to sign for and they left a ‚Äúsorry we missed you‚Äù tag. I was livid.
10q4ahp,better than ernest borgnine??
10q4ahp,Oh- hahaha! You‚Äôre probably right. Maybe the unsuspecting package owner got a treat.
10q4ahp,"honestly the misogyny is too effing much.

i saw one skit about her going to the dr, and she said something about stuffing her underwear under or in between her other clothes, but why! and i felt so seen. every time i go to the dr now i think of it, as i stuff my unmentionables in between my pants and shirt."
10q4ahp,"Well, I imagine Buddy's head as bigger lengthwise, but Ernie's head bigger widthwise, with both being about equal in volume, so I say let's call it a tie!"
10q4ahp,You might have been the life saver she never knew she needed lol. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1113v3w,"I had something similar. No period for 14 years. Suddenly, I start bleeding, talk to doctors freaking out about possibilities of cancer. 

Had a very painful biopsy along with ultrasounds and other such tests. Finally, saw a gyno who looked at the actual lab work and said no, no menopause, no cancer either. Second round of ultrasounds, and oh looky, not just a retroverted uterus, but also PCOS, fibroids, and adenomyosis as well. I'd also been diagnosed with hypothyroidism a couple months before that, so a whole bunch of reasons I had no periods for 14 years that did not include menopause.

The labs do indicate perimenopause, though. I was so happy when I thought I was done."
1113v3w,Don‚Äôt leave the group. Keep us posted!!
1113v3w,"Supposedly extreme stress, poor diet, serious illness and certain medications are some of the reasons hair might turn gray. And, if the issue is resolved, return to its former color.  

I would suggest foƒ∫lowing up with an endocrinologist to get a good review of ALL your body's hormones."
1113v3w,"Fountain of youth? Share youre secret please üôÇ. Seriously I am happy for you it seems just a return of a younger state.

Edit: I wasn‚Äôt  serious about the fountain of youth but stress related ageing can be reversed to a small degree."
1113v3w,"Nah, continue to hang. Let us know about the weirdness that is your menopause journey. 

57, it‚Äôs been 4 months since my last period which has been very light for the past 3 years but there. (Doc says my ovaries just don‚Äôt want to give up)"
1113v3w,Thank you for this post. It just convinced me to definitely go through with my hysterectomy next month.
1113v3w,"That is completely bizarre. Sounds like you‚Äôve done a thorough workup (each time!), so I‚Äôm so happy for you there is nothing evil at play, gynecologically. I‚Äôm with the other commenter, though. Maybe see an endocrinologist to be sure there isn‚Äôt another hormone system going wonky.  It‚Äôs. Just. Too. Weird!"
1113v3w,"Wow. What a Rollercoaster.  Please stay with us!! You may have found the secret to reverse aging! Lol If not, we are happy to support you regardless."
1113v3w,Just curious: did you take the COVID-19 vaccine? My doctor told me that she had a patient that was in menopause and started having periods again almost immediately after receiving the first shot.
1113v3w,"If you didn't go 12 full months without ANY bleeding, then you cannot possibly be menopausal/post-menopausal, despite what the hormonal blood work stated.  This is yet another problem with hormonal testing, they ""confirmed"" you are menopausal, when in fact you were not.  The only determining factor for 'confirming' menopause (for those who did not have surgical removal of their uterus) is how long you went without any bleeding.  

If you never went more than 12 months (in a row) without a period, then you've been in perimenopause this whole time."
1113v3w,"No. That isn't a thing. I got my first grays at 27, lol. Your gyno sounds ridiculous, as gray hair is not tied to ovulation. And there is no ""reverse menopause."" There is also zero reason you would have to leave this community no matter what, as plenty of us are not close to being in full menopause. This post is bizarre."
1113v3w,"If you start getting acne, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôve found the fountain of youth."
1113v3w,"I do come from a family with a history of endometriosis and PCOS and yes, I also had the freak out over the possible cancer diagnosis."
1113v3w,"Most of the women in this group aren't even in full menopause, so why would she even think she has to leave?"
1113v3w,"I won't be leaving, you are all very lovely.

I thought this was solely for those in menopause or approaching it and I didn't want to be breaching any rules."
1113v3w,"The main reason we go gray is genetics. Some people are fully gray at 30, some are barely gray at 70."
1113v3w,"Thank you. It is on the list of things I need to do next along with keeping an eye on everything, regular testing and doctors visits.  Maybe stress put me into early menopause the first time?  I don't know.    

The only things that were happening around that time was the first time it happened my daughter started her menses and I was worried about her inheriting the family PCOS and endo.

The second time was her first visit to the Gynaecologist who upon hearing about the family history said I'd need to see her too about mine but I said I was in menopause and didn't need to worry about that.  A couple of months later and I was getting a referral."
1113v3w,That's not a thing. Come on!
1113v3w,"Hopefully I'll get some answers.

I do admit I had to laugh at your last line.  I've been in contact with my sisters so they could warn their daughters as a just in case.  Both of them commented along the lines of ""Well I always knew you were a bit weird"".  We've always had that kind of sibling banter relationship."
1113v3w,"Yes I had the Covid vaccine but it was probably three months later that I started bleeding.  Looking back, I do remember some cramping and that beforehand but I can't say if it is related or was just a stomach bug or something."
1113v3w,"I went over 5 years the first time with no bleeding.  Because I have endometriosis and PCOS I thought it might be blockage and went to see the doctor for a referral to a Gynaecologist.  GP did tests for hormonal levels, an ultrasound and both my bloods and uterine thickness showed I was in menopause.  I didn't have my mom's history to go by to work out what was normal in our family as she'd had a hysterectomy at mid 30's and my maternal grandma just did not talk about such things.

When it started again I did see a gynaecologist in March 2017 who confirmed all the details the doctor provided was correct, the testing results that had shown I was in menopause at the time and he was concerned about what was happening.  When it stopped he said it was strange but possible as a ""last gasp"" from my ovaries but said to follow up immediately if it happened again.

Mid last year and it is back with a vengence."
1113v3w,"She went 5 years with no period, I think? The post is pretty odd."
1113v3w,"Not sure why I was downvoted. There are tons of us in peri, very early stages, here."
1113v3w,Seconded!  Don't leave please!
1113v3w,Have you even read this sub? And all women are approaching menopause.
1113v3w,And some of us start going gray at 16.  I did.  So did my mom and her father. All 3 of my kids as well.
1113v3w,"Of course, yes. But OP mentioned having her hair go gray only to **return to its previous color**. And it appears that *temporary* gray hair is usually tied to some sort of mental or physical stress/trauma."
1113v3w,"I have thinning dry hair, but not even a single gray. I‚Äôm 53. Even my hairdresser thinks it‚Äôs strange."
1113v3w,"You weren't in menopause before if you aren't now. You don't ""come back"" from menopause. It isn't a reversible condition."
1113v3w,"Downvoted because I said there is no such thing as a ""return to your younger self?"" Um. There isn't."
1113v3w,"Who knows? I can never tell if the way I feel is related to perimenopause, my ongoing anxiety issues, or from having COVID twice, or the vaccine.  Hope you get through all of this soon."
1113v3w,"Yeah then it makes sense to get bleeding checked and ruled out -- which OP did.  But if since then if they've not gone another 12 months without any bleeding, then perimenopause it is."
1113v3w,I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm in peri.  Just here to learn about peri.
1113v3w,My grandfather's hair was completely white by the time he was 18.
1113v3w,"Me too! Visibly gray since high school, fully gray by my late 30s."
1113v3w,Yep.
1113v3w,It's genetics. Not everyone is gray at 50.
1113v3w,"Look I am sorry if you have a problem with me Impossible-Will. I can see you've made a lot of comments on this post.

I don't know why this happened.

I have medically trained people telling me this happened

I have doctors and two gynaecologists who say yes I was and no I am not anymore.  One gynae has been practicing for over 20 years the other is over 35 years and is the head of the G&O department at one of the main teaching hospitals in my country.  

I just came here to provide an update on a previous post."
1113v3w,Thank God. My younger self did some dumb things.
1113v3w,"If you go 5 years with no period and you aren't on continuous BC or something else that is stopping the flow, and don't have health issues that would stop it, I'd think you are deeply in menopause."
1113v3w,Who knows?
1113v3w,"What probably happened is your initial menopause was misdiagnosed. You were not IN menopause. But doctors are quite honestly really clueless about all of this, sadly."
1113v3w,"Unfortunately, a lot of gynecologists do not know anything about menopause. Your story doesn't make sense. You do not enter menopause and then exit it. Once you are in menopause, you are in menopause. You don't just -- reverse course five years later if you were ACTUALLY in menopause. If this happened to you, you should be written up in a medical marvel book. It's not a thing."
1113v3w,Could be POF? Likely undiagnosed due to OPs age.
1113v3w,"Well I don't know what else to say.  You can call me a liar if you wish, all I can say I have said and I thought I would update my story.  I can only say what I've been told by medical professions who between them have at over 50 years of experience in practicing in the field."
1113v3w,I don't think you are a liar. I just think there is some information missing or you've been told something incomplete. There isn't any such thing as spontaneous menopause reversal.
1113v3w,"And you might be shocked at how ignorant even the best docs are about the workings of menopause. Even most gynecologists know very little, unfortunately. All you have to do is read this sub to see the ignorant bullshit women encounter from their doctors on this topic. 

If I were you, I would go to an endocrinologist as well. They can sometimes know more. My guess is you weren't actually in menopause before and something else was causing the lack of bleeding. Once you are in menopause, particularly for five full years, you are permanently in menopause/postmenopausal. 

So something just sounds off in what they are telling you, or some crucial information is missing/not understood. Blood tests definitely do not tell the whole story and can't always diagnose ""menopause."" When in peri, your hormonal tests can be all over the place and sometimes show ""postmenopausal"" levels. Then the next day your levels could be wildly different. 

You may just have been in peri and still be so now, and there was some other issue causing the lack of bleeding (medication, diet, another issue). But it's just not really medically likely or even possible to go from being five years post-menopause and then just start ovulating again out of nowhere. Our bodies don't do that. If so, you are a modern miracle and they should want to study you.

I went almost three years with no menstruation due to eating disorders, for example. I wasn't ""in menopause,"" however. As soon as I gained back a certain amount of weight, the bleeding started again. There are lots of things that can mess with our cycles."
10saph5,"I found an Endrocrinologist who specialized in HRT for women and men. He was very pro estrogen and testosterone. In fact when I had my consultation with him I told him that my OBGYN had recommended I up my Lexapro and his exact words were: ‚ÄúYes, because you‚Äôre deficient in Lexapro.‚Äù I was shocked - and I must admit, excited. He was several hours away from me, but was very good. I went to him a few times before I found a Dr closer to me who, although not and endocrinologist, is also ‚Äúpro estrogen‚Äù in his thinking. Both have been very good to me while I navigate this process, but if you can find one who specializes or at least has some experience/knowledge of peri or menopausal, you will hopefully have a good experience."
10saph5,"I'm in Canada so it may be different, but my GP (General Practitioner) knew nothing about menopause after going back/forth with me for over a year about symptoms and treatment options.  He finally admitted that ""look I don't know anything about menopause, except that my mother is going through it, but I'll refer to to you someone who does"", and sent me to an endocrinologist.  This referral was to a prominent doctor who used to head some menopause organization and has done research on osteoporosis.  

My appointment was over the phone, where he asked a few questions (presumably looked at my last non-hormonal labs, lipids, cholesterol, glucose, thyroid, etc) and prescribed MHT on the spot.  My second appointment was in-person to review the dosage (which was increased) and to do a bone density scan."
10saph5,"My endocrinologist is the one who finally diagnosed I was in perimenopause when the GYN couldn‚Äôt.  So I stopped going to GYN and have been using my Endocrinologist to help navigate things.  He put me on DHEA and when that didn‚Äôt work he helped me to find a good estrogen supplement.  Every time I get blood work done for thyroid he monitors all hormone levels now.  It‚Äôs hard when you have a medical condition, my case being Hoshimoto‚Äôs, that shares 75% of the same symptoms as perimenopause to get straight answers that aren‚Äôt:  it‚Äôs most likely your thyroid but this and this maybe it.  Go back to your endocrinologist and get your blood work redone as my results are inconclusive."
10saph5,"Yes, my endocrinologist prescribed me HRT after my primary physician poo pooed me. I‚Äôm 50 with no thyroid."
10saph5,Yes and for hashimoto‚Äôs. And the interaction of both. I have been turned away since those are ‚Äûnot serious enough‚Äú for the rare endocrinologists here.
10saph5,My endo said that he doesn't treat perimenopause. I would ask before making an appointment.
10saph5,"I see a reproductive endocrinologist. He was treating me for endometriosis many years ago. I had a gynecologist who was menopausal and was willing to prescribe MHT after a carotid artery scan to make sure I didn‚Äôt have any unstable plaques that could cause a stroke once I started MHT. Before the scan she started me on IntraRosa, basically a DHEA supplement for your vagina. Then once the carotid artery scan looked good she prescribed estradiol patch, prometrium and Imvexxy. My endocrinologist now is much better at discussing levels to dose MHT than was the gynecologist. I had regular ultrasound scans to asses the endometrial thickness every 3 months during the first year and a half of MHT. I feel like my gynecologist would have just done my annual exam and waited for me to complain about a symptom before doing an ultrasound. With the endocrinologist, I feel like I am being properly monitored for uterine anomalies and feel more secure in the dose levels of my MHT regimen. With the endocrinologist I can say that I want the highest dose of estradiol patch to keep my levels from dropping below what is recommended to prevent bone loss and he agrees. With the gynecologist it was more difficult to get a higher dose prescription because they are not trained in menopause therapy. They gynecologist also suggested to stop MHT after a year which makes no sense in terms of prevention of osteoporosis."
10saph5,"I'd recommend Google searching for a bioidentical hormone practitioner. If you find a good one, they'll send labs and check your hormone levels and thyroid,  as well as adrenals. I'm an APRN and am going to be opening a private practice sometime this year specializing in hormone replacement for both men and women, specifically women in menopause. There aren't enough practitioners specializing in this. It will be hugely satisfying to help women with this because I know only too well the misery it causes. Personally,  I found a very sympathetic gynecologist who put me in the Climara Pro HRT patch,  and it's been a miracle for me. I've never had such stable hormones in my life. Climara Pro is not bioidentical,  but it's been great for me. Bioidentical practitioners can be pricy, so this might be a good alternative if you're able to take hormones."
10saph5,"The integrative endo that I went to treated me for thyroid, which created more problems than it solved. She was a nice person but didn't address my real issues. The thyroid meds she Rxed gave me Parkinson's symptoms which stopped when I  stopped the meds. 

Worse,  she didn't take insurance and I traveled to another state to see her. This was so disappointing after all the research I did to find an integrative health practitioner."
10saph5,"I'm on HRT, estrogen patches and oral progesterone. In California and my doctor is amazing. Anyone with a uterus deserves this treatment"
10saph5,">  I told him that my OBGYN had recommended I up my Lexapro and his exact words were: ‚ÄúYes, because you‚Äôre deficient in Lexapro.‚Äù

I absolutely LOVE this line!!"
10saph5,"Thank you! I started watching the YouTube channel of Doctor Berg and he says there are 3 sex hormones but during peri, both estrogen and progesterone decrease dramatically but if the latter dives much lower, estrogen is highlighted and that becomes the problem. Too much estrogen. He says the level of progesterone must catch up to the estrogen‚Äôs to alleviate the peri symptoms. I‚Äôm hopeful that I‚Äôll get a more accurate diagnosis from an endocrinologist after reading all the answers of women here! I live alone so I‚Äôm navigating this by myself. Thank you so much!"
10saph5,"I‚Äôm from SE Asia and turning 52 this year. I‚Äôm giving up on the gynecologists I consulted. One just recommended me to see a psychiatrist who just recommended psychiatric meds. The second gynecologist told me to pray to God about my anxiety. ü§î I‚Äôm going to try consulting with a good endocrinologist first before I try looking for a gynecologist who‚Äôs well-experienced with menopause. I also started watching videos of Dr. Berg on YT. Women here in my country aren‚Äôt much help at all. Either they don‚Äôt experience anything (am I a freak here?) or it happened to them years ago and they don‚Äôt remember any symptoms. I checked online for research on menopause for Asian women from Asia, especially in the Philippines, but none came up. I feel so isolated in this journey. Thank you so much for your input. Appreciate you. :)"
10saph5,"It‚Äôs good that you got that referral + fortunately he was observant with whatever his mother was going through. I‚Äôm fortunate that my Canadian GP is on MHT herself, so she was willing to manage my prescription herself without further referrals (thus far)."
10saph5,What‚Äôs MHT?
10saph5,"Oh, thank you so much! I‚Äôm definitely going to look for an endocrinologist next week. I‚Äôll mention all the infos everyone shares here so I‚Äôll know if the doctor is capable of addressing my issues or not. Thank you! I wonder how many women have Hashimoto‚Äôs Disease but isn‚Äôt diagnosed correctly."
10saph5,Same here. I do have hypothyroidism. My gyn wouldn‚Äôt listen to me or treat me bc it‚Äôs only been5 mos wo period. But I have ALL the nasty menopause symptoms üòï
10saph5,Thank you for sharing! I‚Äôll check with a good endocrinologist next week before I see another gynecologist!
10saph5,Did the endocrinologist found out you have Hashimoto? Did you get a second opinion?
10saph5,Oooh! This is a very helpful tip! I don‚Äôt want to pay the doctor‚Äôs fee only to find out later on that a particular endocrinologist doesn‚Äôt want to deal with it. But did you get lab works done with him and you transferred to a different endo? Or you just looked immediately for a different one?
10saph5,"This is a breakthrough. If you don‚Äôt mind, could you DM me the infos of your endocrinologist? I know I‚Äôm from SE Asia but I‚Äôll try to get in touch with him if I feel the endos I‚Äôll meet here aren‚Äôt knowledgeable enough. I‚Äôm scared about triggering dormant cancer cells in my body because my maternal side has had cancer patients. Thank you so much in advance!!"
10saph5,This is helpful input! I‚Äôll try to look into all your suggestions. You‚Äôre right; there aren‚Äôt many practitioners who specialize in menopause management. Please DM me your infos. I might contact you if I‚Äôm in doubt of the results here. Thank you.
10saph5,"I feel you! I can‚Äôt imagine you developed more problems. And wasted more money! :( And thank you very much for sharing! I‚Äôm trying to learn from all the positive and negative experiences of the women here who post. Not all physicians are skilled or experienced enough. Not mostly their fault though because science is actually a field of trial and error. But what i find frustrating the most is the lack of empathy from the physicians; dismissing the symptoms when your life is unraveling each day, and you feel inexplicable fear. Plus aren‚Äôt GYNEs or GPs supposed to recommend to a woman 35 years and above to see an endocrinologist first before a psychiatrist/ psychologist if they cannot find anything that alleviates her symptoms? All women are going to go through peri and menopause, why skip the hormones checkup?? Sorry I‚Äôm starting to sound emotional but it‚Äôs just soo frustrating. They‚Äôre supposed to be the medical experts we run to in these times."
10saph5,"Did you get this prescription plan from an endocrinologist or gynecologist? If you got it from an endocrinologist, what did your gynecologist say to it? Thanks for sharing!"
10saph5,Lol I always wondered why an antidepressant is the solution to a physical problem.
10saph5,Yeah it was pretty incredible to hear a Dr say that out loud.
10saph5,Lol same
10saph5,"I agree with Dr. Berg. P is really important during peri and beyond. I was quite hesitant to have my dose increased (irrational fears) and honestly I really feel better. I had to navigate a lot of this by myself as well especially early on. I know estrogen gets most of the press (and for some very good reasons), but there are some good posts on progesterone (probably archived). 

If not there is a lot of good information on P [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics_of_progesterone) especially about the route of administration and different doses via those routes. You may already have this info, but if not, it may be helpful."
10saph5,I read that too!! That P falls way faster than E. Did he give you both?
10saph5,"We are here for you. Who cares wherefrom anyone is. We are all women together here, going through this.

I am from Germany and awareness that menopause just maybe something more than hot flashes is slowly dawning but for me who is suffering this is much too little too late. I hope my daughter (now 19 and convinced she will never be old meaning anything over 35 lol) will be better off. I vow to be there for her and help her through and not forget when hopefully I will be a silly but tough and smart and happy old biddy."
10saph5,I am from the Philippines and I am 35! I am going through the exact same thing and it is exhausting.
10saph5,I too am from the Philippines and 43. Going through the same symptoms and it‚Äôs freaking me out.
10saph5,üíú
10saph5,"I think it‚Äôs menopausal hormone therapy. Just another term for HRT, I believe."
10saph5,Thyroid issues going undiagnosed is a common thing.
10saph5,What are your symptoms if you don‚Äôt mind?
10saph5,I asked several. Not worth their time.
10saph5,Actually he's my diabetes doctor and I just asked at the last appointment. I haven't looked for a strictly menopause doctor. Yet....
10saph5,"Yes, thank you for your response. I can only say the phrase that we used to utter when I worked in government,  ""Stop looking for logic"". I'm emotional about it also. I almost feel like I am on a bandwagon shouting at the top of my lungs through the streets ""Here Ye Here Ye, beware the peri-menopause and coming difficulties getting treatment!!""
Yeah, we are going to have to advocate for ourselves, beat the drum, and educate those younger than us before anything will happen. And so we will."
10saph5,from my Gynecologist
10saph5,"On retrospect, my perimenopause might‚Äôve started when I was 45 or 46, and I‚Äôm now turning 52. I just wasn‚Äôt aware because the palpitations were seldom. But I gained weight that time (about 5 kilograms though nothing changed in my diet or lifestyle).  I lost it again just last year but the primary symptom (irrational fear as you put it but I can actually, physically feel it in my chest. Good thing my mind is strong enough to remind myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the hormones. Try to get a grip on yourself.‚Äù) has been affecting my work now so I just started really paying attention. I don‚Äôt want to take psychiatric meds (as prescribed by the psychiatrists) that might do more damage than good. Even the cardiologist cannot find anything wrong with my heart even if I feel the fear and palpitations physically. Thank you so much for the link! I‚Äôll look into it!"
10saph5,I haven‚Äôt consulted an endocrinologist yet but I‚Äôll post updates here. I‚Äôll try to see one on Monday. I hope other women post their experiences here  too because it seems no one has mentioned anything about more progesterone or testosterone. It seems everyone‚Äôs given more estrogen.
10saph5,Thank you for your kind words! I don‚Äôt know if the symptoms are hereditary though. My two aunts had full hysterectomy when they were in their 20s. Only my mother gave birth amongst three sisters but they‚Äôre all dead now so I‚Äôm clueless and alone into this medical journey. :(
10saph5,">Who cares wherefrom anyone is. 

Our health care systems are different depending on where you live.  For instance, in Canada we don't necessarily see gynecologists for menopause, we usually see our GP for all issues, including pelvic exams.  Whereas in the US, gynos are the 'go to'."
10saph5,"Do you mind sharing your experiences? If you know of a good endocrinologist or gynecologist, please let me know. How do you know you‚Äôre in perimenopause?"
10saph5,"I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about it. I joined three Facebook support groups last year for menopause but not found more helpful infos from this Reddit group! Please let me know if you find a good endocrinologist. I plan to have my hormones checked first before I see any  gynecologists again. I feel I wasted money on them but I haven‚Äôt gotten any relief since last year. Now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed since 2018; instead of going to psychiatrists or psychologists, I should‚Äôve gone to an endocrinologist first. Primary care or General practitioners never considered my gender and age when I kept returning to the ER. Im upset at the ignorance of the doctors we have."
10saph5,I‚Äôll definitely look into thyroid issues especially the second cousins of my mom had thyroid issues if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Thanks for all the tips!
10saph5,"Should have listed üòâ but I‚Äôll blame that on meno brain fog!! In addition, massive anxiety that doesn‚Äôt let up. 

The daily 3am wake up call along with the random hot flashes and baby break downs - both anger and crying over inconsequential things. 

Dry eyes and dry mouth. Zero sex drive. Just to name of the heavy hitters‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also noticed zero motivation in life‚Ä¶nothing interests me. I‚Äôm like a totally different person - someone I have never met and as of now - don‚Äôt care for. üòï 

my GYN wouldn‚Äôt even talk to me about it bc according to her I haven‚Äôt really started meno despite the above symptoms. Her definition was NO period in 12 months‚Ä¶and the last I had was 5 mos ago. According to her I still have 7 mos to go before she would prescribe anything. So silly. I‚Äôm suffering and she told me to eat some yams and take black cohosh ü§£ 

so I went to my male endocrinologist and he was shocked by her lack of response/care and he ordered Estradiol 0.0375mg Patch (twice Wk) and Progesterone Micro 100mg Capsules. Excited and scared to start!!

Hope this helps‚ù§Ô∏è"
10saph5,"Yes, I agree with you about banging the drum and hear ye, hear ye. üëçüëç"
10saph5,"I didn‚Äôt think we needed testosterone, i thought it was just the other two."
10saph5,"Well they say sometimes you can tell from other women in your family but of course it depends on gene distribution- and personal factors - and hopefully also the individual soul.

What I meant to say is as a rule things calm down as we get older. A lot less anxiety and stuff. Not everyone but most."
10saph5,"You‚Äôre right. I guess I was the one who made my health plan. Last year, I saw cardiologists, GPs, GYNEs, psychiatrists, and psychologists. None found anything physically wrong. I was the one who requested to test for FSH because I  suspected my symptoms point to perimenopause and the GYNE said I‚Äôm in the threshold of menopause because it‚Äôs 125 already. I forgot the units indicated on the paper result, so sorry. I already thought of looking for an ENDO but I got swamped with work and the holidays. But this anxiety, this gripping fear, is getting worse. It‚Äôs so frustrating realizing I might‚Äôve been misdiagnosed since 2018. Im sure more adult women here in SE Asia experience what I‚Äôm going through. They might be seeing a psychiatrist when in fact they should be seeing an endocrinologist for hormonal imbalances."
10saph5,But you‚Äôd be very surprised how not seeing a gyno is a really common thing for young women here‚Äîat least until they want to consider having children. Wasn‚Äôt the case for me‚ÄîI went to one at 19. But a survey of other women‚Äôs health subs here reveals SO many young American women getting their birth control and other gynecological diagnostics via GPs.  It comes down to one‚Äôs (private) healthcare plans quite often.
10saph5,"I wish there was a decent women‚Äôs health telehealth service available to all of you in SE Asia/near SE Asia. I was searching and it seems like Indonesia may have some options via a couple of Singapore-based companies. But that‚Äôs just Indonesia. üòï

ETA: I apologize if people in Philippines don‚Äôt consider that SE Asia!"
10saph5,"Crying over inconsequential things. 
= I can relate to this. I sometimes feel weepy in the middle of work. 

Brain fog
= I‚Äôm also experiencing more ‚ÄúThe word is at the tip of my tongue‚Äù moment and it‚Äôs frustrating because I know I know the word. 

Involuntary 3 AM wake-up call
= No matter what time I sleep, 8 PM or 12 AM, I used to wake up at 3 AM last year. I ask my mind who the heck set my body clock to that? I worry that my body and brains aren‚Äôt getting enough rest. Then it switched to before 6 AM. I get 5 hours of sleep now when I used to sleep for 8 hours in the past decades. I live alone in SE Asia plus we here get more sleep than most of our western female counterparts because of lifestyle. But now I guess our sleep becomes pretty much the same in perimenopause. 

Dry eyes and dry mouth
= I went to the eye doctor 8 years ago and had them started using eyedrops to help with the eye lubrication. People would comment my eyes in pictures look shiny as if I just cried. Dry mouth also started a year ago. I‚Äôm turning 52 this year. This month, I also notice my skin on my arms and legs look dry as the desert. Where there were no lines before, they‚Äôre starting to look l like leather. I dunno if they‚Äôre artistically fascinating to me or something I need to visually dread and learn to accept. 

Zero motivation 
= Yesterday Friday, my mind was screaming at me  I had three work deadlines by Monday and I spent most time in bed. Not because I wanted to procrastinate but apart from feeling physically heavy overall (which is confusing as it‚Äôs new to me. I‚Äôve always been in a healthy weight all my life; slightly moderately active as I enjoy swimming , walking , and doing yoga. I also very seldom eat processed foods, milk, and sugar), I just wanted to stay in bed doing nothing. Awake but just..  being there. On the bed. This makes me legitimately feel anxious as I know people are depending on me to submit my work on Monday. 

I feel you when you said you‚Äôre excited YET scared to start on Estradiol. I‚Äôm excited that I found in Reddit this idea of seeing an endocrinologist. If women here didn‚Äôt share, I can‚Äôt imagine how I‚Äôm going to go through this alone for more months or years. I‚Äôm hopeful an endocrinologist here in the Philippines will correctly diagnose my symptoms. I was very surprised to read that even in western countries, the gynecologists aren‚Äôt well equipped to handle menopause. I mean, are they just trained for assisting to giving birth? Aren‚Äôt there so much more women who go through menopause than women who get pregnant? Women don‚Äôt have a choice over menopause but more and more women are opting not to get pregnant even if they‚Äôre healthy. Plus people in Asia depend more on medical advances in the West. If the women in North America or Europe don‚Äôt get diagnosed correctly because of lack of sufficient knowledge of physicians, what other chance do we here have?‚Ä¶ :( I‚Äôm also scared to get into HRT because my maternal side has history of cancer. I didn‚Äôt know my father and his family so good luck to that side. But according to Dr Berg on YouTube, it‚Äôs possible to avoid triggering these dormant cancer cells. I‚Äôm trying to get all infos I could get from all kinds of sources to help myself. I felt so isolated in the past year because nobody (doctors and other women) could explain to me here what was going on and I felt fear I was going crazy but now I have hope from Reddit. 

Thank you, CM, for sharing. And to the other women here, too. I didn‚Äôt want to make a long post but I hope if I‚Äôm descriptive enough, I we could also help others who are shy or afraid to speak their minds out."
10saph5,"Online articles show that decreased libido, muscle weakness, fatigue, thinning hair, and other symptoms might be due to testosterone deficiency. Some women on menopause might need testosterone instead of estrogen then."
10saph5,Exact same thing happens here. Doctors are 99% clueless menopause can cause severe mental issues. Endocrinologists won‚Äôt see you for female issues. You really have to inform and look after yourself and then fight the system for the correct treatment
10saph5,Well over here contraceptives are prescription only that means all young women see an ob gyn. It‚Äôs also free until 23 (state thinks that‚Äôs cheaper than loads of teenage pregnancies üòÉ)
10saph5,"No need to apologize, Dahlia. It‚Äôs so kind and sweet of you to check. Thank you! I don‚Äôt know the situation in other countries about menopause or women‚Äôs reproductive medical care but I tried talking with many women here and no one seems to be interested. That‚Äôs why I feel isolated. It‚Äôs like they feel or felt no symptoms at all. This week snd month, I‚Äôll check endocrinologists first. Maybe I‚Äôll get some breakthrough over there."
10saph5,I think we are twins.
10saph5,Thank you for mentioning that about aren‚Äôt there more women with menopause than giving birth. ‚ô•Ô∏è
10saph5,Sorry. Not necessarily testosterone but androgen.
10saph5,Thank you for your time and insight! I‚Äôll do more research. Appreciate everyone here.
10saph5,"That‚Äôs because, like the Dutch, the Germans are a realistic that don‚Äôt make a church the arbiter of women‚Äôs healthcare‚Äîand why both countries top the world numbers for fewest teen pregnancies. 

Oral and internal contraceptives are by prescription in the States, as well. But we somehow authorize GPs to prescribe them, which explains why a great number of young women put off establishing a relationship with a gynecologist. Plus there‚Äôs all that denial; a young woman doesn‚Äôt have to worry about her parents questioning a visit to a GP because a certain percentage of Americans have their heads buried in sand."
10saph5,"Almost all the women I know my age and older, though all great people, likewise do not have much of anything to say about menopause or perimenopause. And that includes three older sisters."
10saph5,What are your symptoms?
10saph5,You‚Äôre welcome.
10saph5,"Well,  being struck with severe mental illness due to peri, I have envied the fantastic opportunities for treatment in thr U.S. But all in all, I see with astonishment how irrational and ideological a lot of things are overseas - it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs striding in the same direction here although we are still behind you. The times are against logic, rationality and loving compassion which would govern the world if I had a say."
10saph5,Pretty much everything you listed in your first 3 paragraphs plus I can‚Äôt lose weight to save my life.
10saph5,"There are certainly opportunities, but with one‚Äôs health insurance tied to your employer, it sees the unemployed go without care, or small companies providing poor or inadequate insurance to many, such that they cannot engage anything but basic care. I have been lucky, but pay a lot out of pocket‚Äîand I have to be pushy to get specialty care.

The idea that grown women have so little body autonomy here is sickening. But I keep hoping more sane, rational, secular young people are beginning to vote. It‚Äôs not a place to age, I assure you."
10saph5,Weight must also be part of the hormone issue. :(

10h2e8k,A New Harvard Study Shows Women Are Turning to Cannabis for Menopause Symptoms Because They are Largely Failed by the Healthcare System and Need to Function at Home and Work and In Their Lives Instead of Wandering to the Back of the Cave to Curl Up and Die Quietly
10h2e8k,"Works wonderfully for calming the rage, relaxing, easing migraines, sleeping, soothing anxiety and if I‚Äôm nice and high the orgasms are mind blowing and endless.  It‚Äôs not for everyone but for me it‚Äôs been a necessity"
10h2e8k,"I'm tired and read that as 'turning into cannibals' lmao!

But somewhere, out there.... and I'm not judging."
10h2e8k,"Great article! I recently bought some CBD-melatonin gummies (I currently live in a state that will never legalize it). They were expensive, and didn't help. I don't have trouble falling asleep but from about 1 AM onward I wake up every hour if not more. Also, Melatonin makes my dreams too vivid even at a lower dosage, which these have. I am really looking forward to living in a legal state very soon!"
10h2e8k,It helps with my sleep.
10h2e8k,"For anyone in states where THC is illegal, you can look into delta-8 THC. It‚Äôs made from hemp, so it‚Äôs legal under the farm bill. A bit less potent than regular THC and also less anxiety for some. Easy to order from online retailers."
10h2e8k,"Definitely am. Was before, even more so now.  Surprisingly I've found some specific strains help with my anxiety and migraines. I use topicals on my achey parts too.HRT is magic but I'm still 3 mood swings and an inflammatory chronic illness in a trenchcoat held together by duct tape.  :)"
10h2e8k,[deleted]
10h2e8k,"I'm going to the dispensary tomorrow.   Edibles are it for me these days. 

I'll get a bit of smokeables every now and again, but gummies are my go-to.  Indica to relax and sleep.  Sativa to get shit done.  A blend to just help my mental health and keep the joint (ha!) pain at bay."
10h2e8k,"I use vape pens and I have been recommending Purple Monkey for relaxing, Blue Dream for frisky times, and Jack Herer for upbeat stuff.   All time favourite for fun is Girl Scout Cookie.  I use vape pens because they are discreet, don‚Äôt stink and are easy to control.   I don‚Äôt like to feel messed up.  I call them my ‚Äòlady weed‚Äô. 

I‚Äôve found many of the people at dispensaries very knowledgeable and helpful when selecting stuff. 

Even regulated, I find the gummies and edibles can be a little unpredictable, they often don‚Äôt specify the strains and they take awhile to kick in then you‚Äôre stuck on the ride.   You can‚Äôt just have a little rip and be on your way. 

I‚Äôve not enjoyed many of the pure sativa strains, they can make me feel like chaos, which I don‚Äôt need.   I stick mostly to hybrids or indica."
10h2e8k,"CBD has really helped me keep the rage under control. Texas doesn‚Äôt have legal weed so that‚Äôs all of got. It works for me! 

My husband‚Äôs response: ‚ÄúI hope they didn‚Äôt spend too much to figure this out.‚Äù üò∏"
10h2e8k,Helps with sleep and night sweats - 40mg
10h2e8k,"I live in Amsterdam, just sayin'..."
10h2e8k,"What the what? 

>Although several treatment options (e.g., hormone therapy) are effective for treating menopause-related symptoms, most are associated with negative side effects (e.g., mood swings and fatigue) and increased risk of developing cancer.7,8

Fatigue, really??? And the 'increased risk of developing cancer' references were from 2016 and 2017 (specifically the 2017 hormone therapy position statement of NAMS???) - [the 2022 version of the NAMS position statement was published by this very same journal with quite a different take,](https://www.menopause.org/docs/default-source/professional/nams-2022-hormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf) why would they have used the 2017 one after all that's happened since then??


Anyway, yeah I totally use sleep gummies and they've been a life saver for me. I absolutely hate using drugs, have never wanted to use drugs, could happily have lived my life not using drugs --- but a woman's got to sleep and the medical community shrugs indifferently at us, so here we are."
10h2e8k,Helps me
10h2e8k,Can‚Äôt wait
10h2e8k,"Hell yeah. Edibles, bong rips, CBD."
10h2e8k,Weed is keeping me sane
10h2e8k,"I went through peri and meno in my twenties before I knew what was happening and I felt INSANE. Thank god I have access to safe, legal cannabis- and also valerian root, just from the health food store or whatever, it‚Äôs for anxiety. 

Those two plants got me through. I don‚Äôt know how I could have done it without them!!!!"
10h2e8k,CAN CONFIRM as I sit here stoned on my couch eating chocolate covered cherries and Manchego cheese. Use it every night to sleep and considering CBD for daytime...mood stabilization?
10h2e8k,"I have enough symptoms, I don't need more!"
10h2e8k,Yeah if you even feel the psychoactive part of weed. I don't so it's all useless to me. CBD & hemp included. I've tried it all. Glad it helps some of you ladies tho. (Not a tolerance issue.)
10h2e8k,We‚Äôll yeah. It works.
10h2e8k,If you‚Äôre looking for stimulation‚Ä¶look into strains with Limonene. It may help awaken your lady bits!
10h2e8k,Haha perfect edit!
10h2e8k,Say it again!!
10h2e8k,YES!!!!
10h2e8k,Beautiful..üòç
10h2e8k,I need this all in my life. I‚Äôm counting down the days to it being legal. Could you please let me know what to buy? I have no clue‚Ä¶oh I can‚Äôt smoke but I‚Äôm open to any other way.
10h2e8k,Omg yes. The orgasms.
10h2e8k,PREACH!
10h2e8k,Omg!! Yes! To all of it! It literally is a game changer for orgasms lol!
10h2e8k,if it works for you .. jk

10h2e8k,"I had the same issue with Melatonin even on incredibly small dosages.

Also, idk why but no matter how early I took it I was groggy in the morning, where the thc wears off before I have to get up."
10h2e8k,Wisconsin?
10h2e8k,Me too.  Half a gummy (so 5mg) at bedtime is the only way I get any sleep at all.  Also really takes the edge off my migraines which have kicked into high gear with this.
10h2e8k,"I just discovered that I bought delta-8 sleep gummies at my (legal recreational state) dispensary! And they also work! I can't tell the difference, only knew because I read the label when I was checking to see if they had CBN in them."
10h2e8k,"I can get delta-8 where I live. I might try that because the CBD product didn't work for me. I really appreciate this group, because I have searched all over on reddit for delta-8, and no one else seems to really have the same goals for using it as we do. It sounded kind of scary, but I think people were using it more recreationally and taking higher doses- I am not sure."
10h2e8k,"I am in Utah, married to a Mormon.  No Cannabis for me, oh well.  I have always wanted to try it."
10h2e8k,"Man that is on my bucket list for sure. Nothing crazy tho. Just really wanna sit at a cafe, eat a plate of chocolate cake & have an amazing cup of coffee."
10h2e8k,I took some a friend gave me and I felt nothing but vomited all night. I‚Äôm scared to try it again but geez I need something right now. Did it bother you in other ways? Or just zero reaction?
10h2e8k,"Not the person you were asking, but I can't smoke either but gummies, chocolates, tinctures, etc. have really helped me."
10h2e8k,"I use a vape pen mostly, it‚Äôs quick and doesn‚Äôt stink. Works great for minor headaches too! I also love to get high and take a really long hot shower in the evening. Totally my zen."
10h2e8k,"Hit up a dispensary, they can help find an appropriate strain. There are some really great ones for sleep and chill vibes/"
10h2e8k,"Are you near a legal state? Plan a road trip! Every dispensary I‚Äôve been to has had super knowledgeable, nonjudgmental staff."
10h2e8k,Are you in the U.S.? I order edibles from [Moonwlkr](https://moonwlkr.com/)
10h2e8k,They are intense and never ending.  My husband often will give me a few sips of water and let me catch my breath before continuing.  I‚Äôm sure the neighbors must hear me crying out! ü•¥
10h2e8k,Good to know that the THC wears off by morning. I was wondering about that. I am glad it's working for you as well as for the migraines. I get really bad headaches that absolutely nothing works on. Just legalize it federally already!
10h2e8k,Me three.  I took melatonin for a bit and slept through the night and dozed most of the day.  A bad look in court.   My daughter uses CBD oil without THC as she is sleepless  but our family history of schizophrenia means THC wants avoiding.  We‚Äôre in Australia but it can be prescribed for sleep.  I think I‚Äôll have to be next.  It does cost a lot though.
10h2e8k,Melatonin alone makes me groggy in the morning. I can't use it.
10h2e8k,"I've been taking it (6mg most nights, sometimes I don't need it) for a while now & I've noticed I'm waking up with headaches. Not super groggy but the headaches are becoming a normal thing so I think I may stop taking it altogether. Unfortunately less than the 6mg doesn't do diddly for me :/"
10h2e8k,Texas. We cannot have nice things.
10h2e8k,"Yes, the migraines as well for me too. I suspect it's helping with a lot more that I'm not even realizing."
10h2e8k,"Yeah. CBN is good, too."
10h2e8k,That is now going on my bucket list. Sounds perfect.
10h2e8k,"In my experience if I smoked something that was laced I would get violently sick & throw up. That's only happened twice in life but on the medical stuff I get regularly? No. 

I do feel some things like sometimes my mood is elevated or calmed & sometimes it helps my lower back pain. I can't use it for sleep or anxiety bcuz of the lack of just the psychoactive part. 

I still rotate strains regularly & may feel a bit stoned with a new strain I've never had before BUT it's just for that day & strain only. I won't feel stoned at all the next day. It's so bizarre & I don't buy a bunch at a time anymore for this very reason. 

So from the very little that exists online I've read that it affects women in peri & meno due to the ever changing level of estrogen. If I get baked all day I tell my husband 'the estrogen's hitting right today' ü§£

The closer I get to my period, THE time I hella need it, nothing. Absolutely no stoned feeling or pain relief. 

I hope you try it again, if you feel up to it. It can help if your body lets it ü§™"
10h2e8k,"If you had alcohol before smoking weed it may cause you to vomit. That happened to me and I wouldn‚Äôt try weed again for years. Now that I know more, I enjoy smoking weed very much and find it helps me sleep and to manage anxiety"
10h2e8k,Any strain specifically to ask for? The only part I don‚Äôt have is migraines. The rest is needed.
10h2e8k,I‚Äôve only got just a few more days until I can go to one by my house. üòâ 2 more weeks
10h2e8k,üòÇüòÇ
10h2e8k,What does THC do to schizophrenia ?thanks
10h2e8k,I‚Äôm sorry. Your state is depressing too lol. You will probably get it before us here in Wisconsin. We have the Tavern League making sure people spend all their money in bars rather than get us some of that sweet tax revenue all the states surrounding us get from weed sales.
10h2e8k,"It helps me a lot in taking the edge off my anxiety, but unfortunately my anxiety is much worse during the day and I can't take it while working."
10h2e8k,It really is! It makes me heavy-lidded and I've totally phased out the half a Unisom I used to need to feel sleepy enough to fall asleep. Good stuff!
10h2e8k,I can‚Äôt smoke so I have just tried chocolate and gummies. The chocolate was super low dose medical grade and the gummies were non medical grade so I keep thinking maybe the non medical stuff was jacked up. Recreational is going to be legal soon so I‚Äôm going to try some other medical grade stuff although I don‚Äôt know how that works if I can just walk into a medical shop and ask for something. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10h2e8k,No. No alcohol. It was on an empty stomach though. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10h2e8k,"I don't notice a difference between strains, although some people do.  Sativa is supposed to be less likley to put you to sleep (and has that effect on some) but half a gummy knocks me out at night.

As long as I take it, even a whole one, 7 hours before I have to wake up I'm fine and not groggy in the morning.  Some brands are stronger than others, so the reviews on the dispensaries websites are really helpful.

I've had some from Colorado and California which were way stronger than anything I've gotten here in Illinois.  Not sure what's up with that.

The pills hit me much harder than the candies, tinctures about the same but I don't like the oily taste so I don't use those unless it's a crazy sale.  Tinctures are great for people who microdose, because you can guage how many drops you need easier than trying to break an edible down in equal increments past half.

CBD has no effect on me, but most people I know do get a calming and pain relieving effect from it and a lot of edibles have a 1:1 ratio with CBD THC.

Fwiw the dark choch/black cherry my place sometimes has are so good you can't even taste the medicinal qualities."
10h2e8k,Sativa if you want a little energy. I prefer indica‚Ä¶ with about .30 thc.
10h2e8k,Look for something that‚Äôs heavy on the CBD. Maybe 2:1 or 1:1 CBD:THC.
10h2e8k,A friendly PSA ..if you are prone to anxiety (like me even before the meno journey) sativas may increase your feeling of anxiety. (Note that straight CBD is said to counter the effects of THC.  My anecdata confirms this.  üòâ) Do some research into terpines...which many say play a bigger role in effetcs than indica/sativa.  I have definitely benefited from medical cannabis.
10h2e8k,Look I have no idea .  No one seems to have any real idea.  My husbands brother manifested severe schizophrenia with florid hallucinations and this was a severe debilitating illness which ended in his suicide at 35.  It appeared at about 22  and he had been using a lot of weed in his teen years.  But we have no idea if it caused or predisposed him or what.  So we are more taking a ‚Äúbest be careful‚Äù approach to active ingredients in cannabis.
10h2e8k,"Ohhh that explains it. I was actually kind of surprised that in WI it's not legal yet since in MI it is, but I get that the lobbyists are killing the competition. We don't have it because Texas is an actual theocracy. Even Oklahoma has it but I think they needed the revenue more than we do."
10h2e8k,"CBD is what really helps my anxiety and it's not psychoactive, fwiw."
10h2e8k,"It's legal for medical here in Oklahoma. They've got a special vote coming up to try to get recreational on the ballot, but I don't think it'll happen.

Anyhoo, if you have a medical card you can walk into any dispensary & ask whatever you like. Just make sure it's one where the staff is knowledgeable & can actually help you. The Weedmaps app is pretty helpful if you haven't checked that out. (The shop reviews can help narrow down the spot or spots you wanna visit.)"
10h2e8k,Indica is the ticket if you need to sleep.
10h2e8k,Ok thanks! Do you know if recreational is legal can I walk into any shop (formerly medical only shops) and just ask them for xyz etc? Or are the medical and recreational shops different?
10h2e8k,Everything you said is gibberish to me ü§£. Yes I have been prone to anxiety my whole life. So I guess no sativa?
10h2e8k,"I can attest to this too. My friend's brother died of suicide (he was schizophrenic). And then my friend started doing THC and became schizophrenic. I was shocked to see his transformation. However, I thought I was just the only person to suspect a link. I am glad to read your post. Thank you for sharing."
10h2e8k,"Yep. They are in bed with the taverns. They want everyone drinking and driving, and not sitting on the couch stoned lol. We figure the only way we will even get medicinal is if it is made legal on a federal level. This state used to be so progressive but the hateful do nothing Repugs are insistent on dragging us back to the dark ages."
10h2e8k,"I have friends who swear by CBD, I wish that worked for me as it's so much cheaper."
10h2e8k,It probably depends on what state you are in. Here in CA I‚Äôd say go into any retail/recreational establishment and chat with the friendly budtender. Those folks are the friendliest happiest retail employees around and most will be delighted to help you choose something that will work for you.
10h2e8k,"If you live in a state where recreational is legal, you don't need any special paperwork. You just go to the receational dispensary. When I lived in WA, they checked my I.D. at the door to confirm my age, but didn't keep any record of it or anything."
10h2e8k,"Ahh shit sorry! ü•¥ So for me I don't do sativa, but sometimes even indica will trigger anxiety.  That's why I mentioned terpenes, which are different chemical compounds (found in many things...not just cannabis)

This article can explain it better than I can lol!"
10h2e8k,"I think there must be,  but it would be as d√©pendent on brain chemistry as mental
Illness itself. Plenty of people smoke
Pot and don‚Äôt suffer long term consequences or develop schizophrenic tendencies.  But we just can‚Äôt take that chance."
10h2e8k,"I am sorry to hear that. WI is a beautiful state and everyone I have ever met from there has been a super nice, friendly and fun person!"
10h2e8k,Yeah it really is about finding what works best for you. A low level dose in a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD works best for me.
10h2e8k,Ok thanks!
10h2e8k,That‚Äôs kind of what I figured. Thanks!
10h2e8k,Thanks! I‚Äôll read this! Don‚Äôt be sorry. This is all new to me. Happy to have someone help. üòâ
10h2e8k,I completely understand. Wise choice. Xxo
10h2e8k,Get the app Leafly and you can research and find strains that might work for you.  It‚Äôs what I use for guidance
10h2e8k,I echo the sentiment of others on this thread that if you live in or visit a legal state to definitely visit a dispensary and ask questions.  They're generally super friendly and knowledgeable.  üëç
10h2e8k,Just a few more days and I can walk to a dispensary. Medical is legal but recreational will be in just a few days. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Is it weird that I want to hug your doctor??? I think I would break down crying if a health care provider was ever that reasonable at me...!"
10weh7f,Thank you for sharing what you have been through and learned. I'm glad you answered that call! Please let us know how the appointment tomorrow goes.
10weh7f,Congratulations on finishing that marathon last May! Big achievement!
10weh7f,"Well done for sharing, often we don't share the good news when do much of it is the opposite. So it's good to hear when it goes well, and good to know what that should look like.

What was that vaginismus thing you mentioned she spotted? 

Yes to hrt! I'm in the not allowed club, but highly recommend it. I would bloody well save that stuff up bit by bit as well. 

You got quite a good check up there!"
10weh7f,"I‚Äôm so happy to read this. I‚Äôm happy you found someone who hears you, and it‚Äôs good information. Thank you for sharing."
10weh7f,"OMG!! I am so happy for you! Hallelujah! You are marathoners and found a competent caregiver. I could have sunk to my knees crying. Where do we build the shrine?

Today I went for my first follow-up with my new gyno. Had a 10 am appt. This place is across town. I am TRD, not a morning person but took it because if you don't it's months to get in anywhere.

 Well, I set my alarm for 8 and got in the shower at 9. Got into the parking garage at 10:05. Got to the reception took a buzzer and waited 20 minutes to get checked in. Do the paperwork and sit down. The clerk gives me the wrong patient sheet so I go up to return it. 

Here she says to me, "" You were late so you are going to have to wait till 11:30."" Well, OK, it was my fault. So I sat down. 11:40 I  ask when am I  going to be seen. Well, it's going to be at least another half hour. WHAT?!? Punishment for 5-minute lateness?? 

I thought fuck it, I have an other appt clear across town. The cherry on the parfait? The garage attendant(first time I've seen one there) days it's $5.00 because I'm over an hour. Even with a validation?!? I screamed at him, I never even got to see the damn doctor!!! He let me pass.

I'm so glad someone of us is finally getting decent treatment."
10weh7f,"It‚Äôs good you‚Äôre getting the support you need. 

About you RHR, are you basing this off of a smart watch worn at night while you sleep (more technically, sleeping heart rate) or are you actually measuring your rate while awake and resting, such as shortly after waking up?

Garmin frequently shows my ‚ÄúRHR‚Äù as 42 (I do run, but maybe 25 kms a week, and slowly). It did cause me pause as it‚Äôa become lower this year, and so I looked on the /Garmin subreddit and there are a whole bunch of people there who report super lows RHR readings and note the Apple watch is basically the same thing. 

The two take-aways I took from that deep-dive are:

1/ The watches measure sleeping heart rate and not actually resting heart rate, because they do not have the ability to distinguish between the two. To measure your actual RHR, you need to look at your lowest HR when you‚Äôre awake or simply measure it just after you‚Äôve waken and before you start moving. The smart watches measure the lowest heart rate you have for at least 30 mins in a 24-hour period without consideration of whether you‚Äôre awake or sleeping. 

2/ A low-ish RHR (or, what the smart watches call RHR) should be examined with other factors, such as is your HR able to go high and support running, going up the stairs, for a period without getting short of breath, feeling bad, passing out, etc.? The RHR would not likely be looked at in isolation of other factors. 

Let us know if there‚Äôs further updates on your possible bradycardia, as the common low RHR readings among more casual runners with smart watches is very interesting to me."
10weh7f,"‚ÄúOh my goodness, how nice to be heard!‚Äù

That was exactly my feeling after seeing a menopause specialist too. It almost felt like therapy after years of what I consider to be medical abuse or neglect. So relieving."
10weh7f,yay! and glad you answered that phone call. :
10weh7f,"This is so wonderful to hear. I need to dig out a menopause clinic. I am inspired by the wonderful stories and want that for all of us on this journey.

I know we have the various resources to find folks but we need a secret Yelp to keep reviews of them to find great clinics. The hunt for treatment some days is as debilitating as the symptoms. I‚Äôm looking for a clinic for a mammogram which insurance covers (UGH) and clinics thst have crappy billing and horrible service seem to be the standard where I am. Not that it‚Äôs better elsewhere but man, it makes the decision to move easier."
10weh7f,"fantastic! congratulations. hope this great path continues for you.

soooo, 

where, who, we all want her name?

two, what about the knucklehead young man?"
10weh7f,"Your story is eerily similar to mine.

I was diagnosed Hyperthyroid but had to do an ablation to get it into hypothyroid so it could be managed better.

What happened after was a lack of contact with doctors ending with me going very hypo last winter.

Last winter, my RHR was 42. I too gained 20 lbs quickly. I had extreme brainfog. It took until May for my endocrinologist to realize something was wrong. I was finally semi stable in August whereupon menopause hit me. Hello hotflashes!

I now use my Garmin to determine if my thyroid is in balance. If my RHR it is below 57 I am getting too much synthroid. If it is over 63, I am not getting enough. (I am not a runner but a distance bicycle rider).

Personally, I feel you should never have been on statins, your untreated menopause caused them to elevate. Please ask to be retested after the HRT is working, you probably won't need them.

I am on week 2 of estradiol & prometrium plus Tgel for sex drive. Before I was on premarin and never slept. I only was switched because I insisted on a gynecologist referral.  My doctor was getting cold feet and wanted to take me off all HRT (even though my risk was very low) and put me on anti-depressants.

I am glad your doctor at least referred you for help and you hit the jackpot the first time with a responsive gynecologist.

I wish that there were groups on Garmin Connect for Menopausal women. We are mostly ignored and period tracking just made available in the last 2 years.
We should make our own group!

Edit: came back to add more."
10weh7f,"Is rising cholesterol a menopausal symptom, or is that connected to weight gain? I‚Äôm 49 and and two years ago my cholesterol just started going up, even though I eat relatively healthy and exercise. I don‚Äôt want to go on statins, but none of the ‚Äúlifestyle changes‚Äù apply because there‚Äôs nothing I can change. Gah!"
10weh7f,"That's what jumped out at me too. Wow. Sensible, realistic, and not shaming."
10weh7f,"I went to a new endo after my thyroid blood work came back scary. Told her I had gained ten pounds and was on track to lose and she quickly responded that she would give me a Rx for weight loss drug. And even after declining multiple times she kept pushing it. 

For ten pounds."

10weh7f,"I love the image of the poor parking attendant dealing with a crazed menopausal woman. He must have been thinking in his head ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make eye contact, back away slowly, resist the urge to run!‚Äù"
10weh7f,"You‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs a Garmin RHR, and we appear to be similar runners.  My sleep RHR was in the low 40s, but my RHR when I met with the endocrinologist a few minutes after having my foster dog escape was only mid 50s. It‚Äôs one of the reasons he was willing to put me on T4. 

My heart rate at the menopause clinic was low 60s. That was after an hour of frustrating traffic and rushing to get to the appointment. 

Our family passes away by heart disease and stroke so there‚Äôs that as well."
10weh7f,"You can also find providers on North American Menopause Assoc site! That was helpful for me....

....even if the doc I saw kinda sucked."
10weh7f,I‚Äôm in Canada and went to the Sinai Menopause Clinic in Toronto. My knucklehead young doctor is really nice other than not knowing about menopause. He took over from my family doctor who retired so he has 30 years of my records. I think he‚Äôs just finding his way and I‚Äôm happy to educate him on menopause referralsüòä.
10weh7f,"This is good to hear. I was at normal values for TSH and T3 and just under for T4 which is why I pushed for the appointment with endocrinologist. Endocrinologist originally didn‚Äôt want to treat me because my levels were so normal but agreed to try thyroxine to bring my T4 up.  Now all levels are normal. 

He said that he‚Äôs learning to treat the symptoms and not the numbers, in part, from his menopausal colleagues who suddenly seem crazy desperate to feel better and who have converted over to a treat the symptoms approach. With the bradycardia improving he‚Äôs happy to put it in my files that I‚Äôm symptomatic subclinical hypothyroid."
10weh7f,"It‚Äôs a menopause symptom. I‚Äôve always been borderline high even when I was at a normal weight and very fit. And I was the same when I wasn‚Äôt fit and heavier. It‚Äôs just been the last six months that there‚Äôs been a precipitous rise.

My friend is a pharmacist and she loves it when people go on statins. She says there‚Äôs so much evidence that statins do wonderful things beyond the cholesterol such as lowering cancer risk."

1127de8,"Sadly, even menopause specialists can be uninformed about the science. There's a rare but present risk of venous thromboembolism from oral estrogen. Transdermal is safer. 

It's odd that you were prescribed testosterone without first trying the estrogen and progesterone to see whether anything changed. Presumably, this might have been prescribed for libido issues or other sexual functioning. Did she test your level of testosterone? These tests can be unreliable as testosterone levels vary throughout the day. (Testosterone is highest in the morning.)"

It's legitimate, if you want, to ask her about why she prescribed you oral rather than transdermal estrogen, and to ask about the risks of oral estrogen. With any treatment, a person's individual health profile needs to be taken into account. But it's likewise legitimate to ask a doctor to lay out their reasoning for a treatment."

What happens during menopause? Science is finally piecing it together.

All women who reach their 50s inevitably pass through menopause. Experts share the latest science and best ways to cope.

Every woman who lives to midlife eventually goes through the hormonal transition that is menopause. Yet this significant biological event has long been shrouded in secrecy, spoken of in hushed terms or referenced with euphemisms like ‚Äúthe change.‚Äù Only in recent years has menopause been discussed more openly among women and the media, says Nanette Santoro, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a longtime menopause researcher.

Much of what is known about menopause comes from the Study of Women‚Äôs Health Across the Nation (SWAN), an epidemiological investigation that has followed some 3,000 women in the United States since 1994. It‚Äôs a good start, but more, much larger cohort studies are needed to answer the many questions that remain, Santoro says. (By contrast, the famed Framingham Heart Study has tracked more than 14,000 individuals.) It was SWAN, for example, that found women with frequent, persistent hot flashes are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. And it was SWAN that confirmed women‚Äôs longstanding observations that the body‚Äôs lean mass declines and its fat increases during the transition, even if overall weight does not change.

Other research has led to a better understanding of the biology behind menopause‚Äôs marquee symptom: the hot flash. Researchers from the University of Arizona, the University of North Carolina and elsewhere have discovered that declining estrogen in the brain‚Äôs hypothalamus causes certain neurons to enlarge, which agitates sections of this brain region involved with temperature regulation. This important discovery is expected to lead to new, non-hormonal, targeted therapies. (Read more in Is It Possible to Cure Hot Flashes? We May Be Getting Closer.)

So what exactly triggers menopause?

It all begins with perimenopause.

A baby girl is born with every egg cell inside her ovaries that she will need during her lifetime. Surrounding these eggs are granulosa cells that produce hormones, most notably estrogen. In midlife, as egg cells become less numerous and less viable, estrogen production declines.

This, combined with less frequent egg releases, leads to irregular menstrual cycles. When several cycles are a week or more late over several months, the woman is said to enter perimenopause.

This stage typically begins in the mid-forties, although a decade earlier or later is normal, and it lasts from between two and eight years. (Late-stage perimenopause occurs when some cycles are delayed at least 60 days.) It is the shifting hormone levels, rather than an absolute drop, that cause the symptoms associated with menopause, Santoro says.

Fertility declines during this stage, although ovulation‚Äîand pregnancy‚Äîare still possible, according to the North American Menopause Society, which is why the group recommends continued contraception use."

What is menopause?

While many women label the entire process as menopause, that term technically denotes the moment when estrogen levels have dropped so low that ovulation and menstruation permanently cease.

Some doctors measure levels of a hormone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)‚Äîwhich ramps up as ovulation lessens‚Äîto determine if a woman is in menopause. But since levels fluctuate this is not an accurate marker, says Jackie Thielen, director of the Women‚Äôs Health Specialty Clinic at the Mayo Clinic.

In the U.S., the average age for women reaching menopause is 52, although anywhere from the forties to sixties is considered normal. After this point, and for the remainder of their lives, women are in the postmenopause stage.

Can menopause occur early?

A small number of women naturally go through menopause before age 40, which is considered ‚Äúpremature.‚Äù

Others who undergo medical treatments that remove or severely damage both ovaries, such as cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, immediately become menopausal. Because of their abrupt hormone shifts, symptoms from induced menopause are generally more severe, according to NAMS.

What are common menopause symptoms?

Hot flashes: Up to 80 percent of women experience these vasomotor symptoms (VMS), when a sudden, intense sensation of heat rises in the upper body while widening blood vessels bring a flush to the skin.

Flashes generally last from one to five minutes and can occur multiple times a day, according to NAMS. Those happening during the night that are accompanied by profuse perspiration are called night sweats. Flashes may end once a woman reaches menopause, but they can also continue for a decade or longer.

Some women are barely bothered by hot flashes, while others find them stop-in-your-tracks debilitating. ‚ÄúThese symptoms are not trivial. They're impacting many women's lives, relationships, and ability to function at work,‚Äù says Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women‚Äôs Health and medical director of NAMS.

Sleep problems: Shifting levels of the reproductive hormone progesterone can impede the ability to fall and stay asleep, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô Office of Women‚Äôs Health. Night sweats also make sleeping a challenge.

A couple of years after she finished all her cancer treatment, which likely pushed her into perimenopause, sleeping became more difficult, said Rachel Woods, 49, at her home in Berkhamsted, U.K. ""The impact of lack of sleep on your body and your brain carries on throughout the day, you are not able to concentrate, you feel exhausted, and have no patience, which affected my family."" Because her cancer was not estrogen responsive, her oncologist was able tp prescribe hormone replacement therapy. ‚ÄúI still wake up, but with HRT I‚Äôm having more solid sleep again, which I haven't had for probably five years.‚Äù

Mood changes: Rates of depression in women during perimenopause or menopause are nearly double those not yet in this stage, research has shown.

Whether this is due directly to hormones or to sadness over fertility loss or other issues is unclear. Women who can‚Äôt sleep due to flashes and sweats are also more likely to become depressed, researchers have found.

Others who are not depressed may feel irritable or have unexplained crying spells. Those who experienced similar mood swings earlier, around their monthly menstrual cycle or after giving birth, are especially prone.

Vaginal changes: Pain and soreness during intercourse result from tissue thinned as estrogen decreases. Along with similar dryness in the bladder and urethra, this is known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Most symptoms of menopause eventually resolve, but GSM brings lasting physiological changes, Santoro notes.

When do symptoms strike?

The majority of symptoms appear or ramp up during the late stage of perimenopause, the SWAN study found. But they can also strike early, even before a single period shifts, according to results from an online survey published in 2021. ‚ÄúThat study validated so many women‚Äôs sense that something is happening even though they are still menstruating regularly,‚Äù says Faubion, who was not involved with the research."

10zfxwy,"FINAL / 

What are effective treatments?

Basic lifestyle changes help many women cope. Hot flashes are better tolerated by dressing in layers and by taking slow deep breaths and sipping cold water as soon as one begins. Since higher body fat is linked to worsened flashes, people who are overweight or obese may benefit from dropping weight. Smoking is also linked to hot flash intensity.

Improving sleep requires following a regular schedule, shunning late afternoon naps, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol late in the day.

Several mind-body methods have been proven effective, including hypnotherapy, which diminishes severe flashes significantly and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which reduces their frequency.

Multiple studies have shown that herbs and other remedies touted for menopause relief are ‚Äúunlikely to alleviate hot flashes,‚Äù according to NAMS.

Symptoms that severely impact a woman‚Äôs life require medical treatment, especially the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Women who are still perimenopausal are prescribed birth control, because they need higher levels of the hormones to also prevent pregnancy. Women past menopause are prescribed menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), typically in patches or pills, NAMS‚Äô Faubion says.

Many doctors are afraid to prescribe menopausal hormone therapy because of widely publicized results in 2002 from the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative that found increased risks of heart disease, breast cancer, and stroke, for women taking estrogen and progesterone, especially well past menopause, Faubion says. But that study wasn‚Äôt designed to determine if younger women in the throes of symptoms benefit from the treatment, and only a small percentage of them were included, she notes. Subsequent reevaluations of the WHI findings have rejected their conclusion that MHT is not safe for this group, she says.

‚ÄúIf a woman is under 60 and within 10 years of menopause onset, the benefits of hormone therapy tend to outweigh the risks,‚Äù Faubion says. That may not be the case for those with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, liver disease, heart disease, stroke, blood clots, or cigarette smoking, who should have a frank discussion with their doctor.

Other drugs prescribed for menopause that have shown some benefit include clonidine (a drug used to treat hypertension) and gabapentin. With the discovery of the brain neurons as a cause of hot flashes, a targeted, non-hormonal treatment, fezolinetant, is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In initial research, the drug reduced weekly flashes by 45 percent.

GSM symptoms may be treated with a vaginal moisturizer or with estrogen administered vaginally, which seems to be safer than systemic hormones, Mayo‚Äôs Thielen says. Pelvic floor physical therapy and vaginal laser treatments (to stimulate blood flow) are also worthwhile, according to MyMenoPlan, a website aiming to personalize treatment advice that was developed by a network of menopause researchers and funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Since menopause symptoms can last for years, effective coping also involves embracing a new normal, Thielen says. ‚ÄúThe process of losing estrogen and learning to live with erratic and then low levels is what the menopause experience is all about.‚Äù"
10zfxwy,Where? I can't find it? Thx.
10zfxwy,Posted
10zfxwy,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses. But yeah, you get it. It‚Äôs a different kind of infertility"
10zfxwy,Guess I should have added I‚Äôve got three kids already. Im much happier with the teen/young adult phaseüëç
10zfxwy,"well the depression because of no longer being fertile, I can relate to that - while I have had episodes of depression in the past, I definitely do feel a sense of sadness that I'm unlikely to have my own genetic children, unless I have excessive unprotected sex right now, and then besides the fertile part, just knowing that you're aging and all that comes with that, while the bloody media and men make you feel the need to be a hot 28 year old, with gorgeous hair, skin and body. So I can understand the depression part.

I didn't like the last part though, the ""embracing the new normal, and learning to live"" part. Feel like another suck it up and shut up comment."
10zfxwy,"On the other hand, there are millions of women like me who have been waiting our whole lives to escape the curse of fertility, and who are SO TIRED of society trying to tell us that the loss of fertility should make us feel bad"
10zfxwy,"BTW, I'm glad you shared it, I didn't mean that specifically, I just meant to send it to a couple people who don't understand what I'm going through"
10zfxwy,"Toxic positivity.

I would call those types of statements toxic positivity. I hate toxic positivity.

Im in my late 30s, a single childfree woman. My family of women have aways talked about how menopause is early for women in our family...i was hoping they were exaggerating or something when I was younger...ugh...alas. I think I HAVE started experiencing some perimenopause symptoms that are suspicious and that Ive NEVER experienced before.

Weird warm flushes at random times, mood swings, tingling and numbness in my feet, especially at night...my libido seems unusually low...and Ive always had a high and healthy libido and I love sex. I am a very progressive sex positive feminist...so I absolutely do NOT find it fun to have my libido messed with! Augh!

I hate this...I dont want to look or feel older. I dont want people to invalidate me when I express these things...or how much I miss enjoyable sex.

Ive always been a physically healthy woman. Ive never had physical health problems, Ive never suffered any weight fluctuations or anything like that...I have always struggled with depression and anxity mental health stuff, but other than that, I am healthy. I hope any changes to me wont be drastic and sudden. I think my genes and my family's genes are pretty stable and and hearty...but still, I am naturally questioning so much stuff right now.

Ive always used Planned Parenthood for all my sex health needs, and I would like to continue going to them for this if they do provide services for maturing women, do you think that is a thing? Its just an accessible preference for me. I always got my exams and birth control etc through them and this seems sorta related.

Sorry for suddenly yammering on so much at you like this. I dont have many other women in my life at the moment that I can talk to about this...which in itself is frustrating.

Cheers."
10zfxwy,Absolutely! Same here.
10zfxwy,"Look all I can say is I relate to your post 101%, it's as if I wrote it myself. I assume my late mom and my aunt (who has dementia) went through an early menopause. But I'll never really know.

Flip man no one to talk too, friends not going through this now and no mom to talk to. 

Can't comment on the planned parenthood as I'm from another country where people in my demographic primarily use private healthcare practitioners (while we still can)."
10qyu3t,"I just want to say that I know how you feel. I am sure I have ADHD, but my doctor won't even consider it. I was sure before cancer and menopause.

 Not only that, but I'm 62 and still have all the menopause symptoms after surgical menopause about 10 years ago. I can't sleep because I wake up drenched at 3 am every night. No HRT for me because of cancer. I had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and she offered me more antidepressants, then looked at my chart and say ""oh, I guess we've tried you on all of these. well, I don't know what to say..."". Then the appointment was over.

&#x200B;

I'm sick of it all. I can't even fake it anymore.

Hugs to you."
10qyu3t,"Thank God you posted.  I have been searching and failing to find anyone else in this depression hormonal hell. 

It's a three-pronged problem with multiple issues. I started peri-menopause around 39. But at 43 had a daughter. 

So reverse and then postpartum (for which I was hospitalized) on top of already Major Depressive Disorder. My psychiatrist described it as MDD with a touch of OCD & ADHD. Ironically, I was put on Adderall at this time and so had to stop breastfeeding. I don't know how I would have functioned without it, so took it for 15 years. 

Continuing through my 40s and 50s I dealt with this on top of peri-menopause.

Despite seeing 4 different GYNs during this time,  NONE offered me hrt. One put me on birth control, but it made me feel terrible, and I don't remember what else I was on at the time but they didn't work together. 

By the time I hit 60, I had been through every antidepressant on the market at every possible dosage combination. I also went through 3 more hospitalizations to straighten out meds and did two courses of ECT. I began to know what would work and what wouldn't after a short time. 

Then I started to eliminate the ones that stopped working. One of the things that stopped was Adderall.  I tried all the lesser versions. No, go.

Since then, I hit a brick wall. I can't work up the motivation even to walk. I just can't work up a care about anything. I feel useless. My daughter is in college, and I would never hurt her by leaving, but I feel like the walking dead.

It takes tremendous effort to get going if I have morning appointments,  which I try not to schedule. I have even slept in my clothes for fear that I wouldn't get up to get ready on time. I can't keep up the house. Thank God my husband likes to cook and is patient with my lack of functioning.

I have always been a self-helper. But I can't seem to find a way to get through this. Between the invisibility of middle age, the dismissiveness of the medical community about female concerns, and the pandemic employment shortages creating appointment backups, the only energy I work up is anger at the lot of them, and nowhere to express it, except here. 

So thanks to all who read and share this misery."
10qyu3t,"Hormones (or lack of) screw with adhd in the first place. I‚Äôm not surprised that adderall is making things even harder. 

I have bipolar 2 as well, so stimulant medications for adhd are off limits for me. I haven‚Äôt had luck not triggering hypomania even on those, but they all worked with my adhd symptoms. 

Wellbutrin is one, and is even an antidepressant. The others were Straterra, guanfacine, which also knocked back the anxiety, and clonodine. The last one didn‚Äôt work as well. 

So ask your doctor about those, and about other treatments for menopause symptoms. 

I also have weekly therapy for adhd that talks about‚Ä¶ anxiety. Anxiety and trauma work. We don‚Äôt actually talk about adhd much at all. I can work on skills on my own, but anxiety (trauma, depression) makes adhd symptoms worse. Add to that a lifetime of ‚Äústuck‚Äù emotions, reactions, outlook (‚Äústuck‚Äù meaning that those did not change when faced with new information), and it‚Äôs one giant mess. That‚Äôs what I need a therapist for. 

You have a lot coming at you at once. It must be terribly hard and confusing, and what with this new hormonal bullshit we‚Äôve been handed without anyone asking us. 

Go to your doctor. Get the right medication that will help with the adhd and depression. ‚ù§Ô∏è

ETA: Talk about treatments for menopause symptoms, too. These might help with the adhd and depression symptoms as well."
10qyu3t,"I just went off my Adderall in an attempt to sleep, I totally know the ADHD and menopause struggle.

It may sound cliche, but it's true...you're not erased.  We see you and we know how hard it is.  I wish I had concrete advice, but I don't know what to do either.  I'm just so sorry you're hurting and I hope you can find a solution to restore your joy."
10qyu3t,"Please have your thyroid function checked. It's a simple, routine blood test. I was shocked to learn I have hypothyroidism, which is when the thyroid doesn't produce enough hormone. I'm a sister depression sufferer, also on anti-depressants. The treatment for hypothyroidism is a prescription called Levothyroxine. One of the symptoms, for me, was incredibley dry eyes, and sleep problems. Good luck, Sister. It's so hard, I know."
10qyu3t,I know it isn't available everywhere and is costly. But...using psilocybin has changed things for me. Either psychedelic assisted therapy or microdosing can help. Also other new drugs are slowly being accepted like Ketamine. Dr. Tracy Marks on YouTube has good mental health videos that address the new therapies. At least use it as hope that there are new solutions in the works. The legal status and new research are changing quickly!
10qyu3t,"The hormone fluctuations and mood swings are brutal. But not experiencing joy or happiness ever sounds like depression. I know you have tried some antidepressants, but I'm hoping you're open to try different kinds, they all are just a bit different and one could help you get lifted up out of that depression fog."
10qyu3t,Has anyone here tried Ketamine infusions for depression?
10qyu3t,"What about SERMs? I realize finding a doctor that knows how to treat menopause is daunting but they sound promising if you can't go on HRT.  
Also, depending on your cancer risk and comfort, I personally would consider local estrogen if I were in your shoes. I say this as a someone 15 years younger than you and only in perimenopause and no cancer scares yet so please take with a heaping grain of salt and do research

But my honest thinking is your lady parts feeling better is just going to feel better even if it doesn't solve everything. I realize you did not say there was a problem and maybe you already are using a local estrogen but maybe you are not.

My insomnia is much worse. My username is descriptive. My guess is that it isn't the adderall. A break made my sleep worse. Rather its your hypothalamus has been of sex hormones which help regulate circadian rhythm. I dunno what to do without hormones but come back to the SERMs I link to, wonder if it could help."
10qyu3t,"I am so sorry that others are going thru this too.  You didn‚Äôt mention HRT.  Have you tried that?  I experience exactly what you & OP have described and estrogen patch has made a significant improvement.  I cannot believe it.  I was at 50mg and was just prescribed 100mg.  I improved at 50mg but seemed to still have severe swings.  I have been on 100mg for only a week and have just come out of a severe meltdown.  I am feeling significantly better.  I do not take progesterone because it caused mesevere panic attacks.

There is a subreddit that includes links to info on recent research and reanalysis of old studies that indicate risks of HRT are not what originally thought.

Please consider having a look & read.  I hope this helps you. I know what you‚Äôre going through and it is hell."
10qyu3t,"So sorry you are dealing with this! Have you tried exercise? I have had a pretty rough 3 years in my personal life. Last year, was unbearable. Then I was hospitalized in July for a DVT/PE. I exercised before this all happened but have continued and I feel that it has helped me so much with dealing with my everyday crap. Not only are you building endorphins but if you join a gym and go to classes, you will meet new people and some women that are probably dealing with the same issues."
10qyu3t,"We see you. We hear you. You are NOT alone! I know how it feels, the helplessness, the new hope and then defeat with a new med, a new treatment, a new supplement doesn‚Äôt help after all.

Hold on please. There may well be better times ahead. My mum keeps telling me it gets so much better in your 70s (or earlier). 

I have had depression on and off all my life since I was about 8. I had OCD since about 12. Bo treatment until a total breakdown near 40. And then not a very good treatment‚Ä¶ had to look after myself. Picked myself up, did a lot of work and now this even worse breakdown with (probably) perimenopause or menopause at 50. Believe me I know."
10qyu3t,"Between the effects of long covid brain fog, worsening ADHD, and menopause, I too was just going thru the motions of life with no happiness.  6 months ago I had annual exam with blood tests...no testosterone and low estrogen.  Dr prescribed estradiol, testosterone injections, and Vyvanse.  I'm now getting restful sleep, no longer have dry skin, thinking is clearer, able to focus and pay attention.  Testosterone helped my depression, brain fog, and fatigue.  Don't know if HRT is the answer for you, but a blood test will give you some answers.
Life is too short for hormones to make us miserable!"
10qyu3t," If your doctor doesn't have any ideas for antidepressants, then go to a psychiatrist because it is highly unlikely you've tried them all off-label psychiatric drugs used off label for depression. If you mean your psychiatrist and they are out of options, then again, new psychiatrist. Its unlikely you've hit every combo. Not that you want to go through that trial and error, just know that there is likely something out there."
10qyu3t,I am so sorry.  This is horrific.
10qyu3t,"Wow. This scares me. Only perimenopause, at 46. And given how hard its hit me, including the motivation. I just have lost it. I worry about this and if its a result of ADHD. I wonder if the changes to estrogen and progesterone are part of it as they play a role in dopamine regulation. And I wonder if the fact that my motivation has always come from feeling and excitement not executive functioning that if hormones are responsible for mood then is it that I can't will myself forward without the extra drive sex hormones provide?

What you are describing is exactly what I've been afraid of. :/"
10qyu3t,I am so so sorry you are so badly off
10qyu3t,"My heart goes out to you and wish I knew women irl who would be willing to be this raw. I wanted to throw out there that Spravato (esketamine) has been lifesaving for major depression, anxiety, and SI. In the US there are doctors who offer telehealth and will send you the meds to take at home.  It‚Äôs the only antidepressant that‚Äôs worked for me, and it worked quickly. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions if you‚Äôre interested. Collective bear hugs to all."
10qyu3t,"Im sorry it took so long to reply, but you know the great effort it takes to complete any task. I have given up on the medical community. I like my doctor but I think she has helped me as much as she is able to. The same for my psychiatrist. I feel like more of a failure and a disappointment when I go the doctors and continue to complain about the same things. I guess I am just doomed to live my life as an empty shell. I used to love to read but I dont even have the attention span to read a magazine much less a book. if you are a middle aged female your complaints are dismissed, you are labeled as being difficult if you try to advocate for your self. I am lost."
10qyu3t,"I'm going to reinforce the need for trauma therapy for those of us who have ADHD - especially late diagnosed. There is a lot of accumulated crap that we have internalized, and it's not helping AT ALL when we have other menopausal challenges."
10qyu3t,Wellbutrin can really help a lot. I take it in combination and it helps significantly w some of the adhd symptoms
10qyu3t,"Were the dry eyes from the levothyroxine or the hypothyroidism? If from the latter, I definitely need to get mine checked.

In peri and getting super depressed. Unmedicated ADHD too."
10qyu3t,I am very interested in psilocybin as I did a ceremony and it changed me slightly for the better.  How do you use psilocybin?  Capsule or mushroom? Integration therapy?  Thanks for any info.
10qyu3t,"I was just reading earlier today that the depression caused by menopause isn't always treatable by antidepressants and that HRT is the only way to treat for a subset of people. 

I'm sure its the same as those that HRT doesn't help with depression in menopause. But there does seem to be a distinct group that need HRT to successfully treat their depression."
10qyu3t,"My adult son has and it‚Äôs been a life saver. No antidepressant has helped him for long. He did 6 infusions over 3 weeks and then did one more 4 weeks later. He seems to be doing really well. No noticeable side affects and no more intrusive thoughts. 

One downside is that it‚Äôs not covered by most insurance plans - we pay $250 for each of his infusions. The clinic we use also offers a prescription for lozenges that are much less expensive that he can use at home, but he hasn‚Äôt tried them (maybe if his mood gets low or suicidal thoughts start popping up, but before things get bad enough to need an infusion.)"
10qyu3t,Not myself but a fellow patient. It helped him but only while he was on it.
10qyu3t,"My doctor is a psychopharmacologist.

Between her and my regular shrink, they have had me around the block with so many different drugs for almost 20 years.

I don't want to try any new drugs, I feel like they ruined so many years of my life.

I'm just going to try to figure it out on my own, if I can."
10qyu3t,"Thank you, it is. üò™"
10qyu3t,"I am sorry. I wish that I had an answer. I secretly hope that someone has an answer for me. At the very least, I hope that my past can serve as a ""heads up"" to women younger who can seek to avoid the same suffering and atrophy. üòû"
10qyu3t,Thank you.
10qyu3t,Thank you so much. Is it as expensive as I have heard?
10qyu3t,"I do indeed understand.  Thanks for getting the energy up to reply. I feel the same exact way. I left an appointment with a new GP yesterday and had a distinct feeling that even after all the blood tests (again) that this might be the way I will have to exist for the rest of my life. 

It is tiring to be dismissed.  Especially when you are self-advocating. My attention span, as well as my patience, are both shorter.
My fabulous psychiatrist and therapist both retired. Talk about feeling like a failure! Not getting my act together after 20 years with their help says that I am hopeless. I never dreamed that being a middle-aged female would be so damn difficult. I am not used to being invisible, although it's happened enough that I am living with grudging acceptance. Now I am hearing that I am considered ELDERLY!! It really makes it tempting to want to give up. At least you know that one other female is floating out there in this order of existence who is also lost."
10qyu3t,"Hallelujah, yes"
10qyu3t,Dry eyes are from hythyroidism.
10qyu3t,I micro dose and it has helped. I grind the dried mushrooms into powder then take capsules. It really helps with intrusive and negative thoughts. There is a lot of good info online for methods.
10qyu3t,Right now I use capsules. I vary the dose. I use them every few weeks or a little more often but you have to take time off of it or build up a tolerance. I use it as part of my rest and meditation time. It helps me reset. I have not had a therapy session with it but have read a lot of articles and is on my list to try. I have spent more than twenty years on SSRI meds and I am hopeful about this drug.
10qyu3t,"I am so sorry that others are going thru this too.  You didn‚Äôt mention HRT.  Have you tried that?

10qyu3t,"I wish I could help you or at least talk, it‚Äôs such a shame we don‚Äôt have a discord. This night was horrible again. I often feel I cannot bear another anxiety and fear filled night but of course I have no choice."
10qyu3t,I‚Äôll PM you.
10qyu3t,Thank you. None of the 4 gynos that I went to over the last 15 years would prescribe hrt. Can you tell me what those subs are that link to research? I would love to read them. Thanks again.
10qyu3t,Thank you. I wish we could also.
10qyu3t,"[This podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/caroltavris-avrumbluming/) was a great starting point for my understanding.

10qyu3t,I don't. I can look into setting that up.
10skeu7,I just pitched six new pairs bcuz I think they not only shrank but my feet are definitely different now. JFC I just wanna live & not worry about fucking socks ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
10skeu7,"Different ratio of estrogen to testosterone changes foot shape. The collagen changes, and thus the shape."
10skeu7,"I grew a half size with pregnancy and then another half size with peri. Had to get new shoes. Was really pissed off, as I loved some of the shoes I had, especially boots!"
10skeu7,"I feel like, yes, my feet are not the same. They feel thicker from top to bottom of my foot. All of a sudden my boots didn‚Äôt fit as well. It‚Äôs so weird."
10skeu7,Yes. My feet grew and spread and I had to buy all new shoes.
10skeu7,"Is this it? My socks have been pinching and irritating my toes, same socks I have bought for more than 10 years. Another way Peri has found to mess with us"
10skeu7,Oh god. Is this a thing? My feet are already a size 10. I don‚Äôt wanna have to order shoes online only‚Ä¶
10skeu7,I faceplanted into the supermarket carpake a few weeks ago because i couldn't feel my feet.
10skeu7,"I have lipedema, menopause has made it worse and my legs are getting bigger, including ankles"
10skeu7,"Yes. Just like with pregnancy the hormonal changes we go thru can change the shape of our feet AND we become more prone to stress fractures. Loss of estrogen changes EVERYTHING.

&#x200B;

One more reason it's called ""the Change""."
10skeu7,"I have foot issues that I have had to get cortisone injections for ""all the sudden""! A little tailer's bunion just showed up one day!"
10skeu7,I heard our feet can start growing again.  I‚Äôm praying that‚Äôs just a myth because I already wear a size 11 and have a difficult time with finding shoes that are cute and comfortable.
10skeu7,"I looked this up. Your feet can grow wider as you get older. I'm pretty sure menopause gives us a double whammy, so yay. I discovered this when I found a pair of shoes I've had for 17 years hidden in a box. I tried them on. Despite being the same weight as when I bought them, they do not fit. Too small. It sucks."
10skeu7,"Yes, our feet change shape as we age. My bunions become more pronounced each year and my shoe size has gone up from an 8.5 to a 9.5 over the course of the last 20 years."
10skeu7,"Skin, muscle, and tendons all are affected by this mess of hormone fuckery. Feet are vulnerable. People‚Äôs feet get fucked up during pregnancy too. Similar idea."
10skeu7,"get checked for varicose veins, and try compression socks."
10skeu7,"My arches (which are high) aren‚Äôt flattening from what I can see, yet somehow I need a half size larger in many shoes over the past couple of years. It makes no sense to me! Ha ha.

On another note about swelling, I have iron deficiency anemia and I had a ton of foot swelling when it was at its worst after giving a lot of blood (not for donating, for blood tests to find the source of my chronic pain symptoms)."
10skeu7,"I was a 7. Now mostly an 8. Sometimes a 9. And I'm only 5' tall. I've never been able to wear the no-show socks.... My girls all love them, even in winter, but I just can't do it. Certain ankle socks, maybe, or crew. A couple years ago my feet and ankles would just balloon out of the blue and I had to buy these other socks with really loose tops... Secret brand, I think? I lived in Crocs for awhile. I even tried those thin ones you can wear in ballet flats, and holy crap the marks they left!  And they rolled under my heels anyway. Now I'm back to being able to wear regular crews, but I'm finding it hard to find the brand I like locally (I like the Hanes ones, in black for winter), so I'm making do with cheap Walmart ones. I also have a nice stash of wool socks I bought for my husband but were too snug."
10skeu7,Am I the only one who LOST sizes in their feet? I got up to a 7 from a 5.5 before kids. Put on a pair of 6.5 shoes the other day and they were big?
10skeu7,It has for me. I now have bunions. Arthritis hit hard with menopause.
10skeu7,"Elasticity in your feet is like elasticity everywhere as you age, they can start to widen. Super low no-shows are no longer an option and my heels lift out of a lot of shoes."
10skeu7,"Yup. All my beautiful ballroom shoes are too tight now. All my dressy heels and sandals, pttt. No wonder we are considered frumpy. 

We need COMFORT NOW. I'm too irritable to put up with anything else. I always loved dressing up, even if everyone else was casual. Now, I would still love to, but clothes do not fit and tents are not stylish. 

I don't even care anymore."
10skeu7,"Well, I'm definitely getting a bunion on my big toe on the R foot, but I can't speak to socks not fitting ü§î 

Sometimes, now that I've been in my 40s, my feet kinda hurt first thing in the morning and I need some kind of slipper/thick sock to start the day with. Not sure if that's just getting old in general or connected to peri"
10skeu7,"I've had bad plantar fasciitis since I was 18, so frumpy shoes have been my friend for a long time to my everlasting dismay. (Plus I have no padding to speak of on the bottom of my feet.) I do have a lovely collection of 3 inch heels that I always know I will pay for a week after wearing them. Boots are easier to wear orthotics in, I just don't get very high heels in those. My go to brand for a long time was Nine West or Easy Spirit - at 18. Now, I spend even more money on ABEO if I can find a pair that fits my foot. And for work/cowboy boots/ I buy Ariat. That arch support of their's is awesome. Easy Spirit is still my favorite for tennis shoes - plus they sell several widths in quite a few styles which has been great for my Mom who has a wide foot.

I wish I had known to wear compression socks more frequently as a young person. Probably would have helped me tremendously. Now? That's pretty much what I wear whenever I leave the house. I wear them most of the time now when I cook for several hours and to do any house/yard work. I also wear them whenever I go shopping or driving for more than an hour. 

Of course, my favorite brand of socks on Amazon has decided to quit making the old style of socks and moved to an open toe ankle sock and calf sleeve in that weave design instead. I'm not happy. The new style of socks has people not happy with them them versus the old style. Maybe I will try them and quit being stubbornly mad about the change. I have no desire to wear socks+open toe ankle compression sleeve+calf compression sleeve. Or, I will find another brand. (I buy athletic compression socks because I can wear them with shorts while working out in the Texas summer heat without feeling like my lower legs/feet are on fire.)"
10skeu7,"I recently joined this sub because I think I‚Äôm likely in peri‚Ä¶ my mind is blown right now. I thought maybe my shoes were tight because I‚Äôm pretty fat right now, but then the other day I went dress shoe shopping and tried on nearly every pair my normal size 9.5 on up to 11 and none of them fit right. Wtf. Today I learned‚Ä¶"
10skeu7,"I know, right? We've got so much shit going on in our lives already and even our socks are failing us."
10skeu7,I‚Äôve just sized right on out of women‚Äôs shoes. There are NO size 12s. There‚Äôs nothing left for me.
10skeu7,That's exactly what I'm dealing with in addition to sock issues. My sneakers don't look right now and boots aren't comfortable. Ugh!
10skeu7,"""The Change,"" really needs to be a horror movie, if it isn't already!"
10skeu7,"So did your feet and ankles shrink back down a bit? I have noticed that my shoes don't fit as they did, but I have lupus which manifests in joint inflammation, so there's that for me."
10skeu7,Men‚Äôs shoes? Specifically stores?
10skeu7,Amazon or Zappos?
10skeu7,"I thought my dress shoes weren't comfortable because I've forgotten what they feel like - i rarely wear any since the pandemic started. But now i find out this... sigh. Well, that'll free up room in my closet at least."
10skeu7,"Oh, it is already, but it‚Äôs actually a multi-season documentary/reality tv nightmare combo in which we get the starring role, no compensation, an ever-changing script that forces constant improvisation, and do our own stunts."
10skeu7,"Yeah, my feet and ankles are back to normal now. I can wear an extra pair of socks in my boots, if I need to."
10skeu7,"Yup. Familiar with men‚Äôs shoes. I carried mail for 19 years. Have worn nothing but dresses until all my dresses became tank tops or belts over the last couple of years. So I‚Äôve been buying and outgrowing dresses, pants, shorts, etc like a person goes through tissues.  Now‚Ä¶. the feet are finally in sync. So I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs polyester pantsuits and men‚Äôs shoes. I‚Äôve arrived."
10skeu7,"Recently ordered 3 pair -one from Zappos, the other two from Amazon. They were listed as 11.5-12. There was no Euro-equivalent listed. When they arrived, they were all sized 42. The same size I wore when I was size 11."
10skeu7,Yup. Mother Nature is not kind to us. üòï
10skeu7,You win the internet today! üëèüèª
10skeu7,Ugh
10dwyj7,"About every other week or so I start to convince myself it must be a brain tumor.  It's terrible.  Absolutely the worst symptom that I have.  HRT has helped hot flashes but this spacey, light-headed dizziness is still pretty bad at times.  The only thing it is similar to is extreme jet lag - not fatigue but the weird spaciness when your brain is out-of-sync with your physical world."
10dwyj7,"I‚Äôm in perimenopause and my symptoms get worse when I‚Äôm a week before my period. This last month, I couldn‚Äôt swallow thought I‚Äôd have to go to ER, other months it‚Äôs dizziness and legs not working‚Ä¶all over the place :/"
10dwyj7,"OMG YES! Just this week, random floaty head. Why? What‚Äôs the mechanism causing this?"
10dwyj7,"Yes.  Some days it's topsy-turvy.  Then hardly anything for a while.  Breathe.  Keep your eyes open & fixed on something & rise slowly.  Breathe.  Good luck, love."
10dwyj7,I am having the same issue with dizziness. Sometimes it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm going to fall especially if I move my head suddenly.
10dwyj7,"I was so dizzy the last year, it was really effecting my life. It was a different kind of dizzy than I used to experience and was hard to explain to the Drs. I was woozy when I stood up or tried to move from pose to pose in yoga class. 

Dizziness was the main reason I sought HRT because everything else had been ruled out (heart, BP, etc) and I was at the end of my rope. I haven‚Äôt been dizzy once since starting it back in October and got my life back."
10dwyj7,Yup. Am still picking concrete out of my eyes after face planting into the supermarket carpark a few days a go.
10dwyj7,"This happened to me for the first time in a long time about two weeks ago.

I used to get these feelings in my late 20s/early 30s.

I think they‚Äôre hormonal rushes."
10dwyj7,"I have a near-constant feeling of being wiggly/floaty. I have Meniere's disease already so my right side is already prone to it. I am thinking about getting a cane just in case. Meclizine helps me, but it MAY be linked to dementia, which is why I use it sparingly.As far as I understand it, there are estrogen receptors in your brain, and they can be near affect balance.  
In the past new months, I have gotten when it feels liike something hit time me in the head causing a spinning/falling feeling

10dwyj7,So much veritgo for no damn reason.
10dwyj7,"Omg, YES. The dizzy/ floaty/ light headed feeling is terrible. Like‚Ä¶how far is it going to go?  Am I going to just get dizzy and need to sit down? Am I going to pass out? Should I be driving? Perimenopause is the actual worst."
10dwyj7,"Yes! I had some dizziness tonight, and a little rage and crying with a dash of existential despair tossed in. Normally, I‚Äôm pretty even-keeled. üôÑ"
10dwyj7,"Oh absolutely, spacial awareness has dipped massively too. Floaty head, dizziness, extra clumsy and memory loss."
10dwyj7,Yes! I have making a list I have been experiencing for my doctor visit on Thursday. Dizziness is on the list.
10dwyj7,"Some real dizziness, not sure what that's about! I've had low blood pressure all my life, and usually get a head rush if I get up too quickly, with some general dizziness, but not like I've been having lately."
10dwyj7,"Yes. Mine has lessened a bit over the last couple years, thankfully. At one point it was bad enough that a few times I had to clock out of work and go lay down. Even just sitting at my computer made me feel too dizzy and nauseated."
10dwyj7,"Not sure if this will help, but I posted this yesterday. I don't always get all the symptoms with every attack.

I got my first vertigo attack back in 1994 (roughly late 20's). I got diagnosed with BPPV( https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertigo/symptoms-causes/syc-20370055#:\~:text=Benign%20paroxysmal%20positional%20vertigo%20(BPPV)%20is%20one%20of%20the%20most,changes%20in%20your%20head's%20position.))  
  
Not sure if this is something any of your doctor's have mentioned but I thought I would share.  


The  Maneuvers they gave me : https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/home-epley-maneuver"
10dwyj7,YES
10dwyj7,"Yes, I‚Äôm in peri and it comes and goes. I hate it."
10dwyj7,"Yes, very much so: from slightly off balance to full on vertigo at times. I've just started taking vitamin B12 as I think it can be related to low B12 levels (also have other signs of this)."
10dwyj7,"Yea. Often.  Another amorphous and weird symptom which has no cure and somatising apparently‚Ä¶.. BUT !  I think mine might be binocular vision syndrome.  My eyesight has gone out of control bad during menopause - my scripts can‚Äôt keep up with the presbyopia. 

I‚Äôm hopeful this might reverse with time and some of the eyesight issues will go away."
10dwyj7,"On fall of 2021 I had some dizziness and nosebleeds- not much but enough to send me tot he doctor. Everything was fine. I had to take a round of antibiotics for a kidney infection later and man the dizziness was worse. Got sick a few times over winter, one of which ended up having another round of antibiotics and steroids and not only was I dizzy when I turned my head at all- but I had nystagmus which made it impossible for me to drive. I went to the ENT to rule out my ears and any other infection maybe in my sinuses, and they sent me to PT. He said many antibiotics can cause dizziness and nystagmus. It took months before I was better. I‚Äôm currently on a round of antibiotics - same ones I took first- and have had a little dizziness with it. I know it takes many months to get back to normal after antibiotics, at least for me. I never took this many in my life as I have I‚Äôve the past two years! And I‚Äôve never had this much sickness either! Hot flashes came a decade ago for me, but now I‚Äôve had a hysterectomy and no longer losing blood from massive fibroids. My surgeon said my endometrial lining was atrophied already so she thinks I had already stopped having real periods, at least for that time period and the tumors were hemorrhaging instead. I could attribute my dizziness to low iron too probably."
10dwyj7,"I‚Äôve gone to A&E after getting lightheaded. Really bad with tasks where you bend over and stand back up quickly, like tidying or yoga. A&E doc said i was probably dehydrated and to eat more salt. Haven‚Äôt had it since starting HRT. These symptoms we get! So mysterious."
10dwyj7,I liken it to vertigo - hrt resolved it thank the good lord !
10dwyj7,"I felt dizzy daily went I was going through it, I was so scare! I had no clue my unsteadiness was due to this nightmare"
10dwyj7,"Ladies, check out the link for Dr. Foster's maneuver. It helps me tremendously, most of the time immediately, sometimes I have to repeat it for each year in 15 minutes. It has been life-saving for me. If it happens at work, I find an empty office and do it right there.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=LhWmsHOwjA4&feature
I don't know if the link would work, but you can go on YouTube and search for Health Happens: Overcoming Positional Vertigo. It takes only a few minutes to do it and the relief is immediate."
10dwyj7,"I sometimes find myself walking weird or running into things because my balance is Kinda off. 
I was thinking I‚Äôm just clumsy. Lol"
10dwyj7,Something to consider is vestibular migraines.
10dwyj7,"THANK YOU for describing what I‚Äôve been experiencing perfectly!!! I‚Äôve had the same anxiety - what is wrong with me? Do I have a brain tumor? Do I have Alzheimer‚Äôs? Am I going to die? I‚Äôll be driving sometimes and even though I‚Äôm not sleepy, I‚Äôll have a half-second where I feel like I‚Äôve fallen asleep and then catch myself. It‚Äôs so weird. Dizziness, brain fog, whatever. It‚Äôs so weird."
10dwyj7,Extreme jet lag and your brain being out of sync with your physical world:  BEST DESCRIPTIONS EVER.
10dwyj7,"Omg me too! I seriously thought I had brain cancer too!!! I was joking with my husband last week about this very thing! Though not a joking matter, it was freaking me out! But only noticed it since the hot flashes started!!!"
10dwyj7,I'm in peri too and have been dealing with this. I thought it was from the Lexapro I was taking. Guess not
10dwyj7,"I think it‚Äôs the fluctuating (or just plain lack of) hormones, bc i actually remember feeling something similar as an adolescent.  Yay for reverse-puberty and all the yuck that goes with it."
10dwyj7,"Peri-menopause is real, so very real."
10dwyj7,Yea! Like a vertigo feeling. Randomly. Even when just sitting. Very weird
10dwyj7,Do you bash into walls?  I do.  It might be binocular vision syndrome.
10dwyj7,"I think the type of vertigo caused by sudden head movements is called BPPV. Ask your GP. Mine said there are great YouTube videos for exercises to help it, if you look up exercises for BPPV."
10dwyj7,"Dose and formula (patch, pill, etc) please! I know we are all very different, but I‚Äôm still taking notes over here. 

Glad it‚Äôs helped you!"
10dwyj7,So sorry to hear. I wish you well!
10dwyj7,So sorry to hear. I hope you are doing well!
10dwyj7,I will be fine. It could be a lot worse
10dwyj7,Ouch!
10dwyj7,"I‚Äôve always said that if i don‚Äôt fall down at least once a month, the universe is broken.  Now, tho, it‚Äôs more like 2+ times a month."
10dwyj7,"Omg, you poor thing. I face-planted four times last year. It really shatters your confidence and self-esteem."
10dwyj7,I was experiencing the dizziness this morning and thought of you and wondered how you're doing. And I'm so thankful you posted it because my recent dizziness like vertigo but a little more floaty was not cause for concern. I knew immediately it must be related to the peri hormones.
10dwyj7,"Oh wow that‚Äôs awful, so sorry this happened to you. I feel like I might fall, but I don‚Äôt ever actually fall. üôè That‚Äôs scary! Hope you‚Äôre doing ok üíï"
10dwyj7,Omg thank you! I have a touch of Meniere‚Äôs as well! But it has seemed to have gotten  worse since the hot flashes stared! Thank you for this!
10dwyj7,So sorry! I hate this! I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one but I hate it for all of us!
10dwyj7,Oh my god.  SAME.  Fck our lives.
10dwyj7,Floaty head - yep that‚Äôs the perfect word! So annoying! My god
10dwyj7,"I would find a list of symptoms and just remove anything not applicable, it's quicker ü§£"
10dwyj7,Did your eye doc say as much? I feel like my eyes are changing too and wonder if this might be a contributing factor.
10dwyj7,"Dose and formulation (patch, pill, etc) pls!

Like I just said in another post, I know we all respond differently to diff formulations/doses, but I still like to try to keep track of what‚Äôs working for people. 

Glad it‚Äôs helping you!"
10dwyj7,"I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up with me. I had migraines (excruciating ones, where I ceased functioning, for about a year and a half) in childhood on the cusp of adolescence that went away when I got glasses and became an adolescent (not sure which helped more-the glasses or the hormones settling in or what-maybe both). 

Anyway. I had (painless but weird) ocular ones for several months following a major surgery, and then they stopped. 

Now I have the spinnies all the time and it‚Äôs pretty concerning. I‚Äôve been wondering it it could be vestibular migraines."
10dwyj7,"Dozing off while driving is extremely dangerous. Please go to a doctor. Narcolepsy is a thing to ask about. It's not a brain tumour or dementia, don't worry, but the risk is from crashing your car."
10dwyj7,It really is!!
10dwyj7,"Well, I was on Lexapro during peri and I'll tell you, it's hard to tease out the difference between symptoms and side effects for each. 

I was so focused on treating my depression during that time that it never occurred to me or any of the FOUR GYNS that I went to that my symptoms could be a combination. Hence, my opportunity for hrt passed untreated as well as my ability to function in any meaningful way."
10dwyj7,I have to be very careful because I keep going into objects!
10dwyj7,"I have binocular vision but it had never caused dizziness before,  just Alice in wonderland syndrome. 

Is there anything you can take that helps?"
10dwyj7,"Sometimes taking travel sickness tablets can help.

Mine went with the hrt / vit regime thank god. Sometimes had quite bad nausea with it."
10dwyj7,"Thank you! I‚Äôm taking oral estrogen. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the patch and my Dr said I was a good candidate for oral. I Started at .5 but wasn‚Äôt getting much relief. Stable now on  1 mg esteridol and 100 Mg progesterone. Also use vag estrogen cream 2x a week. 

Good luck :)"
10dwyj7,Great üëç
10dwyj7,"Two years ago it was a routine thing for my partner to find me flat out on the floor somewhere having tripped over a leaf or something.

This lack of spatial awareness / balance combined with ice and snow ended in me breaking my shoulder so pls ladies ! Keep going at the doctors / your own research until its sorted !"
10dwyj7,So much to look forward to. I've always known I need adult supervision at all times.
10dwyj7,Thank.You Sweetie. Im doing fine. Everyone is taking good care of me. My Puppy just started her first Heat yesterday so she is is now under lockdown with my boring arse..
10dwyj7,I'm fine. Broke my face to bits but provided spme much needed entertainment for the locals who were all about it. Got to give the ED Nurses some sound bites like oh it's quiet in here tonight where they wanted to murder me and had a yummy sandwich.
10dwyj7,Thank you. I also hate that it's a thing we all have to endure to one degree or another.
10dwyj7,"No. We inhabit a world where menopause and it‚Äôs myriad symptoms are seemingly not ever linked with what is going on in our bodies.  She also said eyes get drier as we age but didn‚Äôt specifically mention meno. I get my information mostly anecdotally from places like this.  When I go to health care, I‚Äôm the one who has to bring up menopause.  I also do look quite young and fit and  I think it might just not occur to people that I‚Äôm menopausal.  Which is stupid as this spectrum of horror starts at roughly forty!!"
10dwyj7,"I take anything between 0 and 2 pumps (am peri so still splurting my own estrogen out now and then) most days its one.

200mg progesterone orally or 100mg vaginally for 12 days starting on day 14. Have found sometimes its not enough and have bumped to 300.g or 200mg depending on route for the first 6 days which tends to sort it. Outcome of not being enough is a bleed around day 21.

Blob of testosterone every day - thats been a recent and welcome add in in terms of energy, sex drive and business brain reverting to normal service.

Supplements on top are DIM, Agnus Castus, Vit C and zinc, b complex with an extra b6, d3 if not getting much sun and magnesium at night with more b6."
10dwyj7,It‚Äôs not really dozing - it‚Äôs more of a split second space out. I just only know how to describe it as the same type of feeling. It‚Äôs just weird. But I will talk to my doc about it. It feels more like maybe a blood pressure drop?
10dwyj7,"That sucks. I asked my psych about the Lexapro possibly causing body aches and fatigue because I just started it last summer and he looked at me funny and said that said that sounded inflammatory and to get a check up.

Thank God he was smart because I was about to quit the Lexapro."
10dwyj7,HRT combipatch has been helping me a lot
10dwyj7,Thank you for replying! :)
10dwyj7,Great username. Apt.
10dwyj7,Sorry.ü´†
10dwyj7,Whew. That‚Äôs intense. Hope you feel better soon!
10dwyj7,"üòì It ain‚Äôt easy, that‚Äôs for sure. 

Hope your eyes stabilize and you start to feel better soon‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all a lot."
10dwyj7,Thanks for replying! Who prescribed all your stuff? Are you in the U.S.? Testosterone seems pretty tricky to come by in some places.
10dwyj7,Yeah. It sounds like it's the peri. Get the hrt.
10dwyj7,Helps w dizziness? Dose pls! Also: glad it helps you!!
10dwyj7,For real ü§£
10dwyj7,Am a Brit in Italy - I buy all my stuff online as I still have not found anyone to prescribe it here. Do a lot of reading on the  subject as most of us do !
10dwyj7,Oh I did. I got a combipatch. So far it's working pretty well.
10dwyj7,Yes! It has helped me with dizziness. The patch only comes with one estradiol dose and there's an option for the higher or lower progesterone dose. I'm on the lower progesterone dose.
10dwyj7,"

Glad you‚Äôre able to stuff you need! The research is endless, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs empowering but also **exhausting**."
10dwyj7,So glad for you!
10dwyj7,Thanks for replying! :)
10dwyj7,Totally - I do feel better for being in control rather than waiting for someone else to actuallt try and help me :)
113gpzz,What a dick!
113gpzz,"You need to make a complaint. Imagine if someone said ‚Äúwhat about depression‚Äù (can horrendously affect life quality, often requires medication, generally curable in time, often a misdiagnosis for peri menopause). How acceptable is a ‚Äútea and biscuits‚Äù response to someone who is depressed? 

Or consider a male-only issue, say erectile dysfunction, how acceptable is ‚Äútea and biscuits‚Äù now? 

Tolerating this stuff makes you feel bad and allows it to continue. Focus your meno-rage at a worthwhile target üòâ"
113gpzz,"Brit here. 

Tea and biscuits are definitely not the solution. I‚Äôm sorry the rep was not helpful.

I know you shouldn‚Äôt have to, but can you broach the subject with his higher ups and say, you need to fix this?"
113gpzz,"I agree with the other user you ABSOLUTELY need to make a complaint.  Ridiculous and insensitive dismissal of a serious health issue.  That person should not be employed in the medical industry, full stop."
113gpzz,"Yes, register a formal complaint"
113gpzz,Why am I not surprised?
113gpzz,What a jerk
113gpzz,"This kinda made me chuckle (imagining his delivery, maybe a la Louis Theroux). And the guy is an asshole."
113gpzz,Don‚Äôt make a complaint. Realize that most people have no idea about anything related to menopause and quite frankly neither do many doctors.
113gpzz,"Dick weed, dick hole, dick bag"
113gpzz,"Silence means approval - while we can‚Äôt change every single thing about healthcare, this person‚Äôs role is a) to know what‚Äôs provided and if they don‚Äôt know, just say they don‚Äôt know, and b) is customer facing. This person needs to be reprimanded."
113gpzz,If someone representing a health care plan doesn't understand a medical need the response is to note the question and let the person know you'll get back to them once you look up the information.  Mocking anyone about a health care question is never okay in the workplace.
10y3zrj,Kudos! Party it up today because tomorrow you'll be *post*menopausal!
10y3zrj,Welcome! Do check out the wiki if you haven't already and ask away if you have questions. This is a very excellent group.
10y3zrj,"Congratulations üéâ 
Still peri @ 50 but fingers are crossed the hormonal headaches will subside once I achieve menopause"
10y3zrj,"Welcome to the club! I‚Äôm not enjoying a lot of this, but not having debilitating cramps every month is amazing."
10y3zrj,"Happy meno day! I shall be celebrating mine short too. 

So far I have been enjoying not having to buy tampons, panty liners, etc...and not worrying about clothing and furniture and stuff."
10y3zrj,"hey, your post reminds me that it's been just over a year for me, too!

ü•≥üéâ‚ú®"
10y3zrj,Awesome! Have any other peri/menopausal symptoms gone away or gotten better?
10y3zrj,Congrats. I just celebrated menopause last month. It's not feeling any different so far.
10y3zrj,CONGRATULATIONS!üåπüåà‚ù§Ô∏è
10y3zrj,Congratulations üéâ
10y3zrj,"ü•Ç Welcome aboard! 

My last, after having gone 11 mths at that point, started on my birthday. The next birthday going the full year without, it just really compounded that OFFICIALLY OLD feeling üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
10y3zrj,ü•≥ Congrats!!!
10y3zrj,Congrats! I‚Äôm going on six months so far ‚Äî this post makes me think I need to look up the exact date of my last so I can celebrate the day (assuming I don‚Äôt get it again before then).
10y3zrj,"Wow, have the migraines completely stopped? I can't wait! I've been keeping my fingers crossed this would be the case ever since my menstrual migraines started at 30"
10y3zrj,"Congratulations. My date was 26th January but I'm hesitating over celebrating because the year before that I went a whole year but had a period on the 13th month so had to restart from zero.

If nothing happens by the end of March I'm going to celebrate."
113p8ns,"It's alarming that the media has pushed her menopausal symptoms as a reason police they suck at doing their jobs! Yes, let's blame her for the disappearance and not whatever is really happening. Just a different version of gaslighting"
113p8ns,"I saw this and was wondering how to bring it here. Peri/menopause is a very grim time for us, I‚Äôm hoping she is found safe too"
113p8ns,This is so sad.
113p8ns,"Ok, Brit here: Sadly the reason the police heve released this information is because so many people were making horrible comments and suggestions that the husband had done something. There were even people turning up at the scene and doing 'tik tok' investigations and potentially destroying any evidence on the ground. Nicola's family will have been consulted about the latest press release, and although it's intrusive, it's been done to stop the armchair detectives. 

Unfortunately now those people can't blame the husband or kidnappers they're making out that the police are calling her hysterical. They aren't. They literally stated exactly why she's had such intensive resources poured into finding her, because people wouldn't accept the usual standard term our police forces use: 'she's vulnerable'. Most people would assume that it related to mental or physical health, as it usually does, and leave the explanation at that. But because of the number vicious rumours, the police have had to be more specific. 

Those rumours, speculation and intrusions onto search sites have caused the investigation to be swamped and potentially delayed finding Nicola.

If she has gone in the river as the police suspect, they have over 20 miles of waterways including weirs, recreational areas and drainage channels to search before the river flows out to sea (The exact same thing happened to a little boy in my town several years ago. He fell in about 12 miles upstream and they never found him. It's suspected he was washed into the sea). 

If anything, this should highlight just how devastating menopause can be mentally, and that those experiencing it can be suicidal, and do take their own lives.

I hope that the family is able to get closure in some way."
113p8ns,"This was not okay for the police to share with the public. Absolutely irrelevant for a missing persons case, and an unsurprising move after basically leading the media/public into thinking she went into the river without enough evidence to do so."
113p8ns,"I think after stating she was high risk 2 weeks in without explanation is only reason they came out with it at all. They should have stated her alcohol issues in the first instance at the very least. Mainly tho, the media has latched onto this case as a distraction from the shit show of politics and plunging economy. 

Citizens thinking they are CSI have hampered the investigation after the first few days. How badly it was botched before then is anyones guess."
113p8ns,This whole case should have been handled better. There shouldn‚Äôt be shame attached to our symptoms and clearly efforts were made to be disingenuous from the outset.
113p8ns,"Being even more specific now, with her symptoms being brain fog and negative side effects from HRT so she went off it. It‚Äôs all incredibly sad and mishandled. 
Sky News this eve https://youtu.be/rN2P80MByhw"
113p8ns,"Apparently the family has released the info because of wild speculation by intrusive public, as being called ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô wasn‚Äôt enough for the masses causing wild speculation. 

Sky news https://youtu.be/rN2P80MByhw"
113p8ns,"You're exactly right, it's being used as a distraction and another reason to bash the police (not all cops are bastards, some are, but not all of them). I dread to think what would happen right now if a child went missing with no trace and the internet CSI brigade started turning up at potential crime scenes or areas of interest, destroying property and evidence. People shouldn't be contaminating the area Nicola was last seen in just for internet likes."
113p8ns,"I can empathise with the family, but I‚Äôm not sure this was a good move, especially with her having children."
10lu3ws,At this point I don‚Äôt want to be skinny I just don‚Äôt want to get bigger‚Ä¶. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10lu3ws,"Unfortunately for me, the only thing that has worked is the idea of consume less, move more. I‚Äôve gradually had to cut out things I used to enjoy, as I seem to burn less calories generally. So no more alcohol, no sugary snacks or drinks, no pasta or bread. No chocolates, no savoury snacks. No crazy amount of exercise as otherwise I will get insanely hungry. It‚Äôs hard getting the right balance and some days I wonder if this is all worth it."
10lu3ws,"Sadly, I‚Äôve found that nothing works. I‚Äôm trying to embrace the new me and eat as healthy as I can and try to exercise some. I feel like this is just part of what we go through and I‚Äôm hoping after all the hormone fluctuations settle that I will be able to lose weight. It‚Äôs so frustrating."
10lu3ws,I know.   It‚Äôs very difficult.   I‚Äôm working to lose weight.   Healthier diet.   More exercise.  Being patient because the weight doesn‚Äôt come off quickly at all.   I never had weight issues.   Menopause changed that overnight.
10lu3ws,"Right now, I figure I‚Äôm winning if my weight stays the same. Still very hard to do.

I happened to start a supplement called DLPA (DL-phenylalanine) months ago for post-covid/perimenopausal  low energy and mood. DLPA is basically an essential amino acid found in many foods and is often in OTC meds for PMS. It seems to decrease my appetite in addition to helping with my moods and arthritis pain (additionally, this helps get me more active in general).  Maybe my appetite is more controlled because my mood is better.

I won‚Äôt 'recommend it'; but I will just say, do your own research before deciding if it's for you.

10lu3ws,Consistency over time works...
10lu3ws,"Get a mini trampoline. It‚Äôs so much fun to turn on tunes and jump and dance. Burns as many calories as running but much easier on the joints. It‚Äôs saved me. 5‚Äô10‚Äù, was 200, now 180 but I feel good and can squeeze my ass into a size 10. Used to be an 7/8 in my skinny days. A 12-14 before the trampoline came into my life."
10lu3ws,"I've found that calories in < calories out is the only thing that works. I lost 30 lbs on a calorie deficit and only very brisk walking as exercise (about 5 miles a day).  I lost it on 4 months. 49 yo here. I've kept it off about a year so far, but have switched to the gym for more intense cardio and strength training 4 days a week. And yes, I still have time for a full time job/ life. It's hard work to do, but worth it to me."
10lu3ws,Intermittent fasting has helped me!
10lu3ws,"I have gained weight over the last year. In the past 2 weeks I have upped my walking distance. I am walking 3 miles daily and eating well. While I haven't gained in a few months, I haven't lost either. I am at my heaviest and I am so frustrated. I feel your pain."
10lu3ws,After listening to a lot of podcasts and following a lot of menopause specialists on Instagram I finally listened to what they were all saying and started lifting heavy weights and increased my protein intake. It has made a big difference in my body! I've also started taking berberine. Its  supposed to be a more natural version of something like metformin. You can read a lot of people's experiences on Reddit and there is some interesting research on berberine.
10lu3ws,"If you have the energy and time to work out and meal plan, you may be able to maintain your weight. It gets increasingly difficult in post-menopause.  

Supplements are by and large a waste of money. They cannot possibly balance the loss of the powerful hormones that we had. I'm sorry yo have to tell you. I may get down voted for this, but it is the truth of my experience.  I truly hope yours is better. However,  you may exhaust yourself with the effort.

I find that since I battled peri-menopause at the same time that I battled postpartum depression on top of severe major depression while raising a daughter, fighting for my marriage, losing my inlaws, my father, my mother had 2 cancers and best friend lost her son in an accident exhausted me.

The over 60 drug trials for MDD at the same time as peri did something medical science has no answer for at this time. None of the 4 gynos I went to during this time offered any hrt that might have helped me survive and function.

As a result, I drag myself around every day and am lucky to shower, dress and meet appointments. Anything over and above that as much as I would love to get back in some shape is impossible. 

I did research, about the possibilities for post-menopause weight loss. As a result, I had to grieve the former me. It was hard."
10lu3ws,"I have nothing to add other than I'm in perimenpause, have and take amphetamines, and this weight gain out of nowhere is no joke. I always responded well to diet and exercise, so as long as I had some discipline, I could keep it off. Now, my belly and wings keeps growing. It can't even be nice and curvy on my bottom and thighs. Oh its also there, but somehow is anything but flattering and curvy. Even if I manage to burn some of it off, it just comes back with a vengeance if I do ANYTHING but a deep caloric deficit. And cravings are off the chart. Carb cravings. And! A combination of exhaustion, avolition, and slowness has cut me down at the knees when it comes to the exercise and daily activity I used to partake in. 

And I think I'm on the very beginning of this weight gain journey. I hate this."
10lu3ws,"[Not a supplement but I found this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5vTuIqTHlBNj2F7OwRfyrL?si=lhmC2O-yQDKAgC5ZFr1Hsw&utm_source=copy-link) helpful and enlightening. She does mention a drug that may help with weight loss, or that what you are taking may cause weight gain."
10lu3ws,"Semaglutide is FDA approved for weight loss in a prescription if you have a qualifying BMI and an obesity complication like pre-diabetes.

Zoe is a retail product like a Dexcom. It measures your blood sugar, fat metabolism and your gut biome.  

Lumen is a product that analyzes your CO2 output to tell you if you are burning fat ( weight loss) or burning glycogen (no loss and maybe gain). They pair the device with recommendations on what macros will work for you at a particular moment. They advertise more carbohydrate flexibility than a keto or Atkins plan.

I am asking my Dr. for Semaglutide. The Lumen device seems like it could teach you how to eat long term. It‚Äôs $299 for the year and then $25/mo after that."
10lu3ws,"(TW Eating Disorders)I‚Äôm just thinking out loud, so please bear with me and my brain fog - I have severe body dysmorphia. From 2015-to the first half of 2022, I was very thin. At times, dangerously thin from diagnosed anorexia. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3.5‚Äù and eventually maintained at 127lbs for a long time. I started taking Cymbalta which was causing some weight gain and I completely lost it. Then emergency surgery throws me into surgical menopause back in August. Since then I‚Äôve gained 20 lbs without changing what or how I eat, which is minimal to begin with. (Celiac and gastroparesis) I hate what I see when I look in the mirror...I feel unloveable and ugly and fat. I don‚Äôt want to inhabit this larger body anymore. But...I don‚Äôt want to give up the little joys I have in life, which are so minimal to begin with. I don‚Äôt want to feel guilty for drinking a Shirley Temple (can‚Äôt drink because of mast cell disease) or punish myself for eating a sandwich on a fresh gluten free ciabatta roll.  We want to be thin and look like our former selves, but at what cost? When I was really thin, my mental health was horrible. I was living in a constant state of panic and fear. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping, barely eating, and couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of impending doom. I cried every day. But I looked damn good. Now at 148lbs my BMI is over what it should be and none of my clothes fit. BUT I don‚Äôt cry every day anymore. I actually enjoy the food I eat and I‚Äôm trying so hard not to be mean to myself for it. I got off the 1% estradiol patch a few days ago and am now on the pills. I‚Äôm starting to feel a bit better. Maybe what we need is to learn to accept our menopause bodies and not chase what once was. Being mindful of what we eat and moving our bodies is of course important, but so is being happy. I don‚Äôt want to restrict myself anymore and be completely miserable just to fit in my favorite jeans that are a size 4. I can find new favorite jeans that are a size 10. And that‚Äôs ok. We‚Äôve all been through a lot...and fight the effects of menopause every waking & sleeping moment. We don‚Äôt get a break from it. So maybe giving ourselves a break in other ways isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I‚Äôm learning how to shift my focus from my weight to things that bring me joy. What if we all tried that? We all deserve to be happy."
10lu3ws,"According to Drs rhe calorie in calorie out method doesnt work come menopause. Focusing on whole foods, less processed and an anti inflammatory type diet apparently does. High intensity cardio is not as good as lower intensity but prolonged and weights."
10lu3ws,"The only thing that works for me is sticking to an insane regimen. It was trial and error for *years.* I mostly do this now for cardiovascular health, as heart disease runs in my family and I unfortunately have inherited high blood pressure and high cholesterol from my dad.

So. I make sure that I get enough exercise every day to burn 500 calories. For breakfast I have black coffee, that‚Äôs it.  Lunch is salad with lemon juice and olive oil for dressing. Lots of veggies. I have a snack midday of about a handful or so of almonds. Dinner is usually a lean protein like fish with more veggies. I don‚Äôt eat anything after dinner. I make sure my total calorie intake does not exceed 1200 per day. 

As far as supplements go, the only one I found to have any effect was Shilajit, but I had to stop taking it as it began affecting my heart rate and blood pressure. Good luck!"
10lu3ws,Ozempic üòâ
10lu3ws,What do you mean about being back into menopause? Please advise
10lu3ws,"Yoga and walking help a lot but switching from the combo pill to estradiol patch only helped a lot. Of course, drinking water, limited sugar and cleaner diet helps. I was already limited dairy and no gluten. Seems progesterone holds water and make me puffy. Similar to my PMS days. Sadly, I lost face and breast volume though. I guess from this point forward I have to pick priorities. I‚Äôm petite so I‚Äôm vertically challenged with a short torso and hate the midriff full feeling limitations. This chapter changes everything."
10lu3ws,"I've lost a few pounds and kept my weight down doing intermittent fasting. It has been  fairly easy and I feel so much better. It's not for everyone, but it has worked wonders for me. Reddit has a great sub on this."
10lu3ws,Maybe try Intermittent fasting or fasting if you can.
10lu3ws,How are you back in menopause? I don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶
10lu3ws,[removed]
10lu3ws,"I wish I was the level of ""fat"" I was in my 30s when I thought I was too fat."
10lu3ws,Same. I‚Äôm trying to really just drink on special occasions. Sucks. I loved my wine.
10lu3ws,Same!!! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and was a comfortable 150ish. Now I‚Äôm 193 and I feel defeated. I also work out 6 days a week!
10lu3ws,">DLPA (DL-phenylalanine)

Thanks for sharing this."
10lu3ws,Meth?
10lu3ws,What brand are you buying?
10lu3ws,Do you follow any YouTube channels? Do you just jump and free dance? Trying to figure out how to best use mine!
10lu3ws,I just play my favorite up beat dance songs. I will jump for one song and free dance for the next. I go back and forth and before I know it I‚Äôve been exercising an hour. Jumping on the trampoline for an hour straight is a lot which is why I hop on and off. It‚Äôs really helpful for the depression and anxiety that comes along with this time too. I used to have an occasional anxiety attack but not when I stay committed to my tramp time lol. It‚Äôs my me time. I can usually do 5-6 days a week. I have added some light ankle and arm weights recently. I never exercised at home before because it was so dull but this isn‚Äôt boring it‚Äôs fun! It is essential to have great music though!
10lu3ws,Can you recommend a brand or type?
10lu3ws,"Totally agree. It‚Äôs the only logical way to do it naturally. A lot of people think a calorie deficit means deprivation, but what you do is start eating BETTER so you can eat more and not feel hungry. You can get full/satisfied on fewer calories if you are eating the right foods. 

That with regular exercise, in my opinion, is the way to go for change and long-term maintenance. And the most important thing about the physical activity is that it is consistent; you don‚Äôt have to be an athlete to get fit. Many of the special diets and strict programs and insane workouts are just not realistically sustainable for a lot of people - at least from what I‚Äôve seen and experienced in my 30 years of adulthood.

I feel like I rambled, but your post really resonated with me! üíó"
10lu3ws,"Ive tried but I just eat the same amount of calories in a shorter amount of time.
Delicious carbs such as bread, chips, pasta make my brain short circuit and I can't stop myself. So I just can't have ANY."
10lu3ws,"Me too - absolutely bloody miraculous. In a year on one meal a day, I lost >70lb. I'm much happier and more energetic, I look great, I can do more with the kids and at work, and it's honestly the best thing I've ever done. I find it easy to maintain.

As of today, I'm the same weight I was when was 21, which is a fact I take a HUGE amount of pleasure from!

The first week is hard, but you adjust fast and I do not find it made me hungry after that first few days. To be honest, the hardest part of it all was getting up the willpower to start."
10lu3ws,Who do you follow on Instagram? I'm just beginning to learn...
10lu3ws,"yep, strength training is ideal. good to take walks and do yoga for wellbeing and flexibility but training with weights is better for long term weight stability and helps with bone density."
10lu3ws,"I find the calorie conversation so confusing. So much I've what I read say to eat under 1200 will sabotage your metabolism, but clearly that hasn't been true for you. Can you shed any light on the subject?"
10lu3ws,"Yes, with my slow ass metabolism I also have to keep it around 1000 calories a day as well- fiber and green calories‚Ä¶ yep! And I have to exercise daily also, always have even in my 20s, 30s, 40s‚Ä¶"
10lu3ws,Any idea about metformin alone? I subscribed to Found for a few months and didn't really get into any of the meds but I still have some left over. I am also considering trying the Topamax but the side effects really freak me out since my job requires me to be sharp mentally.
10lu3ws,"I was gonna make the same joke, lol!! Seriously though, Wegovy is the weight loss one, maybe that? Not sure why people are doing ozempic and not the wegovy, guess I need to read about that."
10lu3ws,This last year I have been in and out. One month I ovulate and have a period and shit is normal. Then for 2 mos I have no period and hot flashes. Back and fourth.
10lu3ws,"Do you know how many women gain weight like this in menopause?    SO MANY!   


And the calories in calories out model is not accurate.  There are many factors that can affect weight gain and make weight loss very very difficult.   Especially post menopause."
10lu3ws,I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù and went from 110 to 140.   It‚Äôs horrifying!     I‚Äôm still strong and I don‚Äôt look as bad as I would have imagined at this weight but I hate it and I‚Äôm so uncomfortable.  On top of all the other menopause uncomfortable.
10lu3ws,No problem! Hope it helps!
10lu3ws,"Precursor to catecholamines. Rate limited by enzymes, end product regulated in the brain like all neurotransmitters and no mechanism to overcome those mechanisms like exogenous chemicals that act on those neurotransmitters. So no, not meth. In fact, its an essential amino acid you would die without. Its common in food, but some people find that taking it and other precursor amino acids help boost certain neurotransmitters within physiological normal ranges."
10lu3ws,I've heard it makes your skin look like shit
10lu3ws,"Source Naturals but only because they're tablets. I don't like capsules. DLPA is pretty cheap. I'd just get the cheapest well know brand that's available,"
10lu3ws,"https://www.jumpsport.com/folding-trampoline-model-230f/?sku=RBJ-S-20853-01&gclid=CjwKCAiAxP2eBhBiEiwA5puhNX0aplZ7WJCv5soHfmYVIXp_V4WPy8oV9pa7FHCbNokuq0nSDk2VyRoCo1gQAvD_BwE

You do want one with good bounce so spending a few extra bucks is worthwhile. You may use it for many years."
10lu3ws,So you only eat one meal a day? How many calories do you think you consume?

10lu3ws,"I think it depends on your metabolism/metabolic rate. As we age it slows down. I had to play around to find how many calories I could take in and lose weight/maintain my weight. For a lot of people, 1200 calories would be too little, but for me, it‚Äôs not. When I was younger I could eat non-stop and could not gain weight no matter how hard I tried (I was underweight for most of my twenties). Medications also screw things up.

I‚Äôm not sure if I really explained what you were asking (and I honestly do not know the exact mechanism for how it works), but I do think it is more individualized than what we believe."
10lu3ws,"People are doing whatever they can get their hands on, there has been a shortage of a lot of these drugs."
10lu3ws,Insurance & cost. Ozempic is cheaper.  Im waiting on a prior auth for Wegovy now its extremely expensive
10lu3ws,"this. 

i think the cal in /out theory only works for people who arent insulin resistant. 

i started testing my blood sugar and found yogurt and oatmeal were spiking me past 200. i never would have known this, and man that means ive been clobbering my (?liver?) with huge blood sugar spikes for YEARS.

i count macros and calories and am very careful- have never been able to figure it out until now. jfc. have also read that Meno can cause you to become even more insulin resistant due to lack of estrogen. so this tracks as so many women are 'suddenly' gaining weight after 50."
10lu3ws,Thanks for that excellent response.
10lu3ws,I didn't have that effect.
10lu3ws,Thank you
10lu3ws,"I just looked it up, it‚Äôs a mortgage payment‚Ä¶ I hope your insurance comes through big time and you have good luck with it. üçÄ"
10lu3ws,"Yes.   It‚Äôs astonishing that many people just refuse to face the updated facts.  

There‚Äôs a woman on instagram who talks all about the blood sugar spikes and offers solutions for them.  Glucose goddess."
10lu3ws,"ah yes! thank you ive seen her. im slowly getting my numbers down, lol its only been 3 weeks for me- but i see progress. i got one of the CGM's and geeking out with it ;)"
10lu3ws,"Dumb question, but if you can figure out what foods are doing this and stay away from them will that help with weight loss?"
10lu3ws,"I‚Äôm not a nutritionist so, I can‚Äôt answer that.  But I have seen her showing foods that spike it and it‚Äôs not  just obvious things like sugar or sweets.  Things like steel cut  oats and other healthy foods can do it.  Apparently eating things in certain order or in specific combination helps. Look her up and you‚Äôll see her giving examples."
10lu3ws,Yea weight loss is def among the reasons for getting blood sugar under control
10lu3ws,Thank you!!!
10p3a2e,I‚Äôm a Huberman fan too! Looking forward to this episode ü§©
10p3a2e,"Oh cool. I‚Äôve listened to a few of his podcasts, but since he tends to focus on men‚Äôs health/fitness, I didn‚Äôt subscribe. I actually have a friend who studied with Huberman in grad school, so he‚Äôs vetted as a ‚Äúgood dude‚Äù too. 

I was hoping he‚Äôd do this topic eventually. Thanks for sharing!"
10p3a2e,Is there anything about libido help? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm interested in. I‚Äôm on hrt. No sexual desire in this meat I ride around in. Just gone. Nothing helps.
10p3a2e,Listening to it now. Really interesting about the cerebral hypo-metabolism in perimenopausal women and how much HRT can help with that.
10p3a2e,Thanks for sharing this! I'll have to give it a listen & I love your name ü§£ü§£ü§£ It's perfect lol
10p3a2e,"Is he legit? I saw his post and was interested in giving it a listen, but then saw he had been on Joe Rogan in the past and was concerned he might be scammy or misogynistic"
10p3a2e,Thank you! I will listen to it tomorrow.  Good to know!!
10p3a2e,On my last eggs is a good podcast.
10p3a2e,I love Huberman!
10p3a2e,"Menopause Barbie is another excellent choice for youtube videos, book or podcasts."
10p3a2e,"Hi Everyone,  
I wanted to share a recent podcast I listened to featuring Dr. Sara Gottfried. Including my notes and some key takeaways from the discussion. Hope this is useful!  
Link to full podcast notes: https://www.podcastrecap.org/post/dr-sara-gottfried-how-to-optimize-female-hormone-health-for-vitality-long-huberman-lab-podcast  


Podcast Summary:  
In this podcast, Dr. Sara Gottfried discusses female hormone health, puberty, perimenopause and menopause, hormone testing, the microbiome, stress related hormone challenges, their causes, and various treatments. They also discuss fertility, birth control and tools for improving microbiome health, treating PCOS, insulin management, and the best nutrition, supplementation, and exercise programs for women.  
Dr. Gottfried is a Harvard-trained, board-certified gynecologist and clinical assistant professor of integrative medicine & nutritional sciences at Thomas Jefferson University. Dr. Gottfried specializes in women‚Äôs hormone health, vitality and longevity using personalized approaches.  
Key Takeaways:  
\-Omega-3 fatty acids play a particularly important role in managing female hormone health.  
\-women suffer from digestive issues at more than 10 times the frequency than men  
\-Women who use the copper IUD have the highest satisfaction rate of anyone on contraceptives, yet it is the least used of all forms of contraception  
\-If you‚Äôre not having a bowel movement every single morning with a feeling of complete evacuation, that is constipation.  
\-Research money that goes into women‚Äôs health is abysmal compared to what goes into men‚Äôs health. There‚Äôs also a huge lack of awareness of sex and gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials  
\-Really understanding what the mediators are of your glucose control is essential  
\-We currently have a disease care system. We need to democratize healthcare data to become a health-based system  
\-Based on Dr. Gottfried‚Äôs synthesis of the data and scientific literature, people should devote 1/3 of their exercise regimen to cardio, and the remaining 2/3 to resistance training"
10p3a2e,I wonder if it‚Äôs the certain episodes you listened to? I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs men‚Äôs focused at all. I‚Äôve found the topics apply to general health/wellness for everyone.
10p3a2e,Ask your doctor to put you on AndroFeme 1 testosterone cream.
10p3a2e,I‚Äôm not sure why you got downvoted but thank you :)
10p3a2e,"He‚Äôs legit. Not misogynistic at all, very scientific"
10p3a2e,Not all all. True academic and delivers the research in a clear concise manner
10p3a2e,Also curious about dismissing because of the Rogan appearance‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a fan of rogan either. BUT his interview with Jewel was fantastic. She‚Äôs an incredible human being with such an inspiring story
10p3a2e,"I just found him and I‚Äôm obsessed, lol"
10p3a2e,Yes . I started on this 3 days ago . I am horny than I ever felt 3 years ago! It‚Äôs great ! I‚Äôm sweet 16 again . Only had a headache on day one .. so still need more months before I write my full experience with testosterone .
10p3a2e,My otherwise wonderful doc will not prescribe testosterone. Too many side effects she said. Idk.
10p3a2e,Haha! People are dumb ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I could care less about that lol Fuck em! Happy Monday ü§™
10p3a2e,Thanks! I‚Äôll give it a listen!
10p3a2e,"I think Rogan is a jerk, but I used to listen occasionally before I realized how problematic he is. He is an excellent interviewer, I‚Äôll give him that."
10p3a2e,I also enjoy the content on Peter Attila‚Äôs the Drive but find his personality annoying. He did have a great episode with the authors of Estrogen Matter which I like to share with others hesitant about HRT
10p3a2e,"I've had zero negative side effects, and it has changed my life for the better in so many ways!"
10p3a2e,Ugh. Another cement head.
10p3a2e,"I‚Äôll check out that episode and go from there depending on the annoying factor, lil"
10p3a2e,I‚Äôd hate to yeet an otherwise great practitioner over this one thing though so it‚Äôs not an option I fear.
10p3a2e,?
10p3a2e,üòÇ
10p3a2e,That is what I call people who are too stubborn to consider alternative perspectives on a subject.
10p3a2e,It sounded like she‚Äôd had some bad patient experiences tbh. Like she‚Äôs prescribed it previously.
10p3a2e,Yes.
10jgmqc,It is living hell to get off of! And made me emotional numb to good and bad.
10jgmqc,I‚Äôm on Venlafaxine at the lowest dose and it‚Äôs a life changer. My rage and anxiety are gone. My night sweats are completely gone. I‚Äôm sleeping through the night. I love the stuff.
10jgmqc,"I‚Äôm on 75mg and it has made a massive improvement in my life. I feel like myself. I didn‚Äôt like the me I was for a year or so before: impatient, angry, curt. But I feel lighter and fun again."
10jgmqc,"I had zero benefit from SSRIs. Tried Wellbutrin and loved the energy and feeling of being alive again but spouse complained it made me angry in the afternoons. Currently on Effexor 37.5mg. I‚Äôd think of it as a milder Wellbutrin. Overall I think it‚Äôs been helpful. r/effexorsuccess is a good sub for info on it from people,who are actually happy with it. This drug has a terrible reputation due to NEED to wean slowly when you get off it.  Also, I found starting the drug was rough: 12 days of really bad fatigue and intermittent palpitations/anxiety. Then the 12th day - poof! That went away and I felt some distinct benefit. I don‚Äôt know if it helps the hot flashes as I‚Äôm on HRT, too. I did it for depression and anxiety."
10jgmqc,Effexor and Wellbutrin together have worked for me in the past
10jgmqc,I‚Äôve been taking it off and on for years for anxiety/depression. I‚Äôve never had issues starting or stopping it that I‚Äôve heard others describe. It has a totally love it or completely hate it reputation.
10jgmqc,"I am on it. It didn't make me numb like Prozac did, also no dry mouth side effect. Down side is it didn't make me numb so I still cry and am pretty emotional. But I am functional, I am not angry, and I am not anxious."
10jgmqc,"I've been on a low dose of both Wellbutrin and Gabapentin for numerous years for other reasons. I don't necessarily feel like they've hurt anything--I mean-- I guess I could be worse! But the reasons I won't go on other SSRIs is that they often make you gain weight and lose your libido, and I should not gain more weight....I'm trying to LOSE it...and I definitely don't need something to reduce my libido. However, I do relate to the bad moods. I just think that doctors throw SSRIs at things, when they don't work very well."
10jgmqc,I went on it when I had staggering depression b/c I was put on aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer.  I‚Äôve had a lot of success and no real side effects but I will say I get the brain zaps if I forget to take it.
10jgmqc,I took this years ago and it gave me horrible side effects.
10jgmqc,"I tried it, it was number 3 or 4 anti-d my doc tried me on.

It raised my bp, which I cannot have happening because I have Stage 3b-4 Kidney Disease (I float)

I also couldn't sleep on it, so she put me on Seroquel for sleep which made me fat.

I'm currently on Gabapentin and I can't really say if it's done anything at all.

I can't have HRT because of past cancer. I also have that damn dense breast tissue as well."
10jgmqc,"I'd never had anxiety at a clinical level until perimenopause either. I don't decry the role and potential benefit of antidepressants, as I am on one myself along with HRT, but Effexor has such a reputation for its difficulties that I'd be apt to look for an alternative first. At the same time, the medication I'm on also seems to elicit wildly negative reactions if online forums are any indication, but I've been fine. Great even. Everyone has a different biochemistry and you never know precisely what will happen to YOU until you try. I think there are other SNRI options that may be worth exploring first."
10jgmqc,I am not on it currently but You just have to take your dose everyday or you get withdrawal effect (sick stomache and headaches) and if you go off titrate under care of Dr.
10jgmqc,"I was on Effexor before peri and have continued it throughout perimenopause (now 6 months with no period). It has helped my terrible anxiety and I have not had any hot flashes. It has an incredibly short half life though. If I forget to take it, within a few hours, I am so angry and annoyed at everything."
10jgmqc,"I take Venlafaxine for my depression, but it's also helped my night sweats so I've found it extremely good, it's really working for me. Been on a strong dosage for a few months and it has really improved my mood and coping. My menopause symptoms are fairly mild compared to many women but I had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy so I'm not dealing with some of the worst bits. I can't take HRT. I can see people are worried that you're being prescribed something for depression when it's menopause but lots of medicine is good for more than one thing. I've been taking a high dosage every morning for a few months and recently changed to one tablet every meal instead. Keeping the dosage the same but spreading it out over the day did have side effects, as did going on it, but they are part of starting a new medicine or changing one so to me I just feel like that means it's working. I found my night sweats got worse whilst changing but they have calmed down again now. 
For me, it's definitely improved my life. I hope whatever you choose works for you. 

Edit: adding a bit more after reading some comments."
10jgmqc,"47f. I can't take HRT because of BC. I was having terrible hot flashes after chemotherapy (which pushed me into menopause). I've been on effexor for maybe 8 months and it's great. I still have some mild hot flashes occasionally but nothing like what I was experiencing. 

It also got rid of my constant low level anxiety, which I didn't even realize wasn't normal until it was gone. Social anxiety is much reduced too. I'm on 75mg. The first two weeks sucked and make me feel really weird, but now I feel great on it. 

No brain zaps or any of the other SEs that other people talk about, but everyone reacts differently. You won't know if it's for you until you try it. Just to add - I was VERY hesitant to try it because I read so many things about it, but I'm glad I did."
10jgmqc,Been on around 10 different antidepressants and this one has saved my life. No side effects when starting. Had horrendous side effects on most of the other pills. I‚Äôve just upped my dose to 300mg and may be starting pregabalin too. This is mainly down to what I think is peri menopause. Severe panic attacks and depression which had been dormant for years came back with a vengeance.
10jgmqc,"I've been on it for many years. It pulled me out of a severe depressive episode. Actually, it was more than an episode. My depression was spiraling out of control and had been for many years. I went on the anti-depressant merry-go-round, and Effexor was the only one that lifted my depression enough to where I could do additional treatments to get me to some level of normalcy. 

If you forget to take it, yes, you will get brain zaps. I had to cold turkey because I lost my insurance, and yes, I felt terrible for a week or two, but it wasn't nearly as bad as the depression; not even remotely close. 

I would say if you've struggled with depression throughout your life and it has been moderate to severe, I would consider it. Or, if the depression caused by peri is making life unmanageable, I would consider it then, too. 

But if you want to take it temporarily just to get over the hump, so to speak, or to even out your moods, exhaust all other options first. Effexor is a lifesaver for me, but if I didn't have to take it, I wouldn't. The weird brain zaps are terrible and withdrawal is a nightmare (although I jumped off without tapering), but for me, I'll take that any day over depression."
10jgmqc,It's insane to me that doctors are putting women on SSRIs when what they have is a hormone deficiency!
10jgmqc,"I have taken venlafaxine, but I found I developed a tolerance to it very quickly. I've also taken gabapentin (though I do not currently). Can say unequivocally, neither worked for me. The doctors then switched me to Cymbalta, with an occasional Abilify chaser. 

The Cymbalta has been far more effective for me, but YMMV. See how you feel on it. Good luck!"
10jgmqc,"I took the lowest dose for a little while. It did nothing for my mental state, but it made my insomnia worse. I tapered off as soon as I could. I didn‚Äôt get the dreaded brain zaps, thankfully. HRT helped with the perimenopausal anxiety and depression way more than either Effexor or Celexa did."
10jgmqc,"Is there a reason you aren't going back on bupropion if it worked before? Or did you mean you are still on bupropion and used that to taper lexapro?  


Edit: nevermind, I saw your answer about blood pressure elsewhere. Effexor could also raise your blood pressure."
10jgmqc,"I've never been on anti-depressants but when I first started getting hot flashes the PA I saw for my ADHD meds gave me Effexor as they were being used for that off label.

I had a terrible reaction from one and almost ended up in ER.  That is not typical, just sharing because people should be aware you can have bad reactions from first low dose and plan accordingly (day off work to start, etc.)"
10jgmqc,"This drug was the first thing my psychiatrist suggested. I was suffering so much I tried it, against my better judgment.

It did help with the PMDD.

It also took away my feelings of love for my children, my sense of humor, and gave me hellish nightmares like I've never had in my life.

And the physical ""side"" effects included vertigo, nausea, insomnia, frequent urination, sweating, constipation and hemorrhoids, and 2 sizes weight gain.

My psychiatrist had me double the dosage to 75mg. I had a routine doctor's appointment and my blood pressure was suddenly dangerously high (it was normal before this drug). After *1* day of 75mg my blood pressure was even higher despite blood pressure medication, and I felt really terrible. My physician gave me nitroglycerin and it made me feel better, so she called an ambulance to take me to the cardiac ER.

I had to quit cold turkey but the side effects mostly went away immediately. Unfortunately I still now have high blood pressure, which may never go away.  Apparently this is a known side effect, but I was not informed.

Full disclosure: I am autistic, with ADHD,  so I react strongly to all kinds of substances. But my brother in law who was a psychiatric nurse was shocked to hear that I was given this strong drug first. I won't take an antidepressant ever again."
10jgmqc,"I was going to post about this today... had my virtual appointment with my family doctor and she suggested low dose Effexor for the hot flashes/ mood swings/ depression, and is sending me for bloodwork to check hormone levels and a mammogram, and pending the results of the mam, is willing to switch me over to HRT."
10jgmqc,I just came off of it. It didn‚Äôt help me and I was on for over a year.
10jgmqc,Exactly. Some of us don‚Äôt have the option to do HRT. As bad as the mood swings and depression get I‚Äôm definitely willing to try whatever (antidepressants)it takes to feel better.
10jgmqc,"I have. 48 years old and was on it until recently. This is going to be long, but it is relevant personal experience.  I was on 225 mg for general depression even though my only complaint was pmdd (I just recently found out my doctor never had that listed as my diagnosis in my records). I was on it for well over two years and my mood/ anxiety/ pmdd had been getting much worse. I also gained over 25 lbs. I had begun earnest cardio and strength training last spring and lost the weight and recently decided to taper off the effexor. It took me over a month to taper off, but I had zero withdrawal issues. I was hit with a suprise though. I started getting hot flashes. By the time I got to my last 10 day taper at 18.5mg, the hot flashes were awful. I read that effexor is prescribed for them and I can attest that I had zero hot flashes before I tapered down. I just started low dose bc pills a week ago and the hot flashes are getting better. 
So for me, it did nothing for mood swings, made me feel very flat emotionally, and I gained weight. Now the weight gain might also have to do with age and perimenopause, I can't rule that out. It worked great for hot flashes and night sweats, and I was able to taper off it with no problems. Just never quit an antidepressant cold turkey, it can literally make you suicidal. Withdrawal symptoms are absolutely horrible (I learned that lesson several years ago). 
Best of luck to you!"
10jgmqc,"I tried effexor and lasted three days. It made me feel numb and odd, and I had a weird metallic taste in my mouth that made me want to keep spitting it out. Not for me."
10jgmqc,"Effexor removed my ability to have orgasms. Getting off it is also a b. No pun intended. I‚Äôm now on lexapro but frankly what‚Äôs helped me most is hrt. My depression is gone so I only have to deal with occasional anxiety. 

Edit: I saw hrt might not be an option for you. Have you considered snris like Pristiq? It was ok for me with minimal side effects. I‚Äôm also on TCM which helps calm me down"
10jgmqc,"I tried cymbalta when in Peri and it made me super lethargic and was hard to get off. I take 150 xl Wellbutrin daily now and love it, no weird side effects at all and it does not lower sex drive. I would be careful with Gabapentin, that drug has some serious long term side effects and it's very hard to get off of.  My Dr gave me progesterone for anxiety and sleep once in menopause. It doesn't help me sleep all night,  but it has really helped lower anxiety which I had bad. I took it all last year and now tapering off due to weight gain, but thankfully the  Anxiety has not returned."
10jgmqc,"Hopefully, your next ultrasound mammogram will be good and they‚Äôll allow you to take HRT. I have dense breasts and have been on HRT since my surgically induced menopause at 39. My doc told me I would be a little old lady by 50 if I didn‚Äôt take estrogen. Now that I‚Äôm 61, they‚Äôre telling me to cut back on my dose. Hot flashes and night sweats immediately started once I lowered my estrogen. At least my bones and heart have been protected for the past 20 years."
10jgmqc,"I know how much we all need relief and almost anything sounds appealing - but if I can help one person- please stay away from this drug.   I was a emotional zombie. I felt nothing , for anyone.  I watched the same show every night for 7 months because I couldn‚Äôt remember watching.    I gained 53 pounds.   ( that took a year to lose )  I could go on and on about the 7 months I lost of my life ,  but the high blood  pressure was the scariest.    And the withdraws from this med will make menopausal symptoms feel like a cake walk.   Electrocuting brain shocks every 30 seconds.  Heart pounding , nausea, scared of my own shadow.     I had to go on another ssri  to get over those withdraws -  it was a nightmare.   

I‚Äôm back to hot flashes , brain fog , insomnia, no appetite , crying spells for no reason - but in comparison to that med, I‚Äôll deal.    The kicker - My ex- Doctor  told me it was all in my head. He never heard such things."
10jgmqc,"Was on Effexor for depression in my 30s. It took me 6 months of tapering to get off Effexor and it was fucking hell. Erratic moods and behavior. Brain zaps. Anxiety & panic. Sleeplessness. Muscle fatigue. It was just awful.

My gyno mentioned it last week for peri anxiety and I said no way. Never again."
10jgmqc,Don‚Äôt do it! Effexor/Venlafaxine contains norepinephrine which made my blood pressure shoot way up. Also made me more likely to get angry. Just curious why did you stop taking the Wellbutrin?
10jgmqc,"Effexor is a rough one. Sam-E is supplement thats has been well studied & performed at least as well as ssri‚Äôs. Its effect is similar to wellbutrin, but hopefully won‚Äôt raise your BP as much. Or try a lower dose of wellbutrin?"
10jgmqc,"I know lots of people on it who love it but I won‚Äôt go on it because it‚Äôs impossible to get off of, and after having gone through withdrawal after Paxil decades ago, I‚Äôm not signing up for that nonsense again. Even the people I know that take it say that if they are an hour late with taking their dose they start to feel dizzy. No thanks."
10jgmqc,"We‚Äôve discussed this here. I understand many have had good results. I took it years ago for depression and withdrawal was the worst I‚Äôve felt in my entire life when I tapered off. My doctor said it‚Äôs about as miserable to get off of as heroin. For me, it will never be worth it, but it may be for some. YMMV."
10jgmqc,"This is what Lexapro did for me as well, but Wellbutrin made me much happier, but raised by blood pressure far too much.   Do you happen to remember what doseage they gave you?  I had heard about ‚Äòbrain zaps‚Äô being why Lexapro is really hard to get off of but I didn‚Äôt seem to have that problem.  I did make sure to taper."
10jgmqc,"Me, too. I've had wonderful results from it."
10jgmqc,"Same. I‚Äôm on 37.5mg and it has really helped. The side effects once it bedded in have been a bouncy right leg, decreased sensation during sex and possibly constipation but that has been standard for me my whole life. Mood, anxiety, brain fog all vastly improved. I"
10jgmqc,Thank you!  It‚Äôs nice to hear some positive results and it‚Äôs making me less scared.  I feel like you‚Äôll find more people with bad results than good online as the ‚Äògood‚Äô group don‚Äôt feel the need to post an experience.  I never bothered to research Lexapro before I took it and now reading the reviews online I likely wouldn‚Äôt have tried.  Wasn‚Äôt horrible for me but not the best solution.
10jgmqc,"Thanks for this sub suggestion just joined.  I do see a lot of people with negative comments in the r\effexor sub, but then I think people are more likely to chime in when it‚Äôs negative than positive.  The Lexapro I took also has the need to be weaned off as well for the same reasons.  I was able to come off it fairly easily.  Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt seem to have much of an effect on me,  I thought maybe because i was in full menopause at that point and the depression and anxiety seemed to have sorted itself out.   Once I went off it I felt the same.  I also had the fatigue and anxiety when I started Lexapro as well, so I‚Äôll keep my eye out for those symptoms, even though it‚Äôs a different kind of drug.   Glad to hear you think it‚Äôs been helpful for you.  I‚Äôll give it a shot.  Thanks!"
10jgmqc,I agree Wellbutrin made me very angry too
10jgmqc,"Wow thank you!  Good to know,  I didn‚Äôt mind Wellbutrin when i took it during peri but it raised my BP,  apparently this will too so we‚Äôll see how it goes."
10jgmqc,Thank you for your input! Nice to hear some fairly positive feedback.
10jgmqc,"yeah I‚Äôm going to have to really keep my eye on my BP as well,  that‚Äôs why I had to come off Wellbutrin.  It surprises me now that she chose to put me on another one that could possibly raise BP as a symptom.  I‚Äôm a horrible sleeper anyway so if it makes it worse i wont be able to stay on it.  She didn‚Äôt really sound like Gabapentin was going to help much for me,  though my dog is currently on it maybe I‚Äôll just try out his‚Ä¶JK lol."
10jgmqc,Thanks so much for the input!  I was starting to get worried with all the negative reviews but I think that‚Äôs the nature of the internet.   I was ok on lexapro so hoping this will be similar
10jgmqc,"But not everyone can take HRT though, that‚Äôs the problem.  When I was in peri I suffered from horrible depression and anxiety which I‚Äôd never had before in my life,  SSRI‚Äôs actually really helped, it was what I needed.   I‚Äôve been reading up on Effexor and they do say it has a very good success rate for hotflashes at low does, with the added benefit of of helping with mood.  It‚Äôs the side effects that I‚Äôm most worried about."
10jgmqc,Thank you so much! Gabapentin is my backup apparently.  We‚Äôll see how it goes!
10jgmqc,"Unfortunately due to my mammogram I‚Äôm not able to go the HRT route yet, but can revisit it in 6 months after my next follow up scan.  I‚Äôll have to give this a shot to see if it helps, though I‚Äôm not seeing a ton of positive stories yet :-(. I do know everyone is different so hoping i can maybe be a success case, or at very least not have horrible side effects."
10jgmqc,Thank you!  Going to make sure I start on a weekend.
10jgmqc,"I had the same side effects, and I'm not autistic, don't have adhd, and usually don't have bad reactions to medications (though gabapentin also gave me bad side effects - these are the only drugs I've taken that have been horrible). A friend of mine oversaw some of the studies on effexor when it was being tested and her and her colleagues called it ""side-effexor."" Can confirm that the side effects were not worth the benefits."
10jgmqc,"Wow that sounds terrible, and I‚Äôm sorry that you had to go through this :-(.  Thankfully my Dr.is going to give me what she called ‚Äòbaby doses‚Äô first to see how i react to it.  I find it weird they would double your dose if you are having such a strong reaction to it!"
10jgmqc,"Yeah, i wish i just had the perfect HRT recipe right away that i could just go on, but I don‚Äôt :-( and can‚Äôt because of the mammograms.  this is my third round of antidepressants,  if you‚Äôd asked me 10 years ago I would have never imagined the word ‚Äòantidepressants‚Äô would even be in my vocabulary."
10jgmqc,"Thanks very much!  I was exactly the same as you on Lexapro,  gained weight, felt emotionally flat.   I do now think the weight was me going into menopause,  i was also in my late 40‚Äôs when I started it, I think this more and more as i read the posts in this sub and see how many of us struggle with recognizing the person in the mirror.  I think I wanted something to blame for it.   I‚Äôm not sure that my experience will be any different with the Effexor but we will see.  Lexapro also made me drowsy and gave me some stomach upset.  I did taper off of it (which i hear is easier) fairly quickly, without any withdrawal symptoms.   I guess I‚Äôll give it a shot since the Dr.will start me on a very low dose (baby dose she called it lol), hopefully a small amount can help/"
10jgmqc,"It was raising my bloodpressure, but now that i was in full menopause i wanted to see if i was good without it,  and I was."
10jgmqc,"Effexor has those zaps when you come off as well! So do a few other anti-Ds.

God I hate that!"
10jgmqc,"Oh, i asked about going back on Wellbutrin in a different comment before I saw it affects your blood pressure. On that note if bupropion increased your blood pressure, then Venlafaxine might as well. Both inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine which is likely what was increasing your bp. Its worth trying, but keep an eye out since you already know bupropion does this."
10jgmqc,So that explains why my blood pressure has been crazy. The doctor increased my Bupropion about a month and a half ago. Maybe I should consider switching to something else.
10jgmqc,"This is great,  happy to hear some positive results from it!  It seems like every post I read about it is a nightmare,  but I do realize people are usually more inclined to post if they have a bad reaction than a good one (we‚Äôre all different and i get that).   Nice to hear some good stories!"
10jgmqc,"That's so funny.

My cat is on Gabapentin as well. She's old and started peeing everywhere. (like me lol)

It has worked for her!"
10jgmqc,"I was on lexapro many years ago. I went straight onto the maximum dose and was practically bed ridden for 3 days. I‚Äôve heard other good reports from friends about Venlafaxine. Sertraline was a terrible one for me personally, but we‚Äôre all different. I really hope these help you. I‚Äôd also suggest seeing a different GP, if you‚Äôve had to take antidepressants for hormonal issues that should tell them you need medication to help with that. I can‚Äôt understand their reluctance when it comes to HRT and general dismissal of the havoc peri and menopause cause ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hope you get sorted x"
10jgmqc,"I'm on 75mg daily Effexor for hot flashes since I can't do HRT. It halved my hot flashes (from every 30 min to every hour), but didn't do much for night sweats (recently added Clonidine to assist with that). Vouching for Effexor if you can't/won't do HRT, but it only does so much.

Side note: Effexor is an SNRI, not an SSRI. I won't pretend to know the ins & outs of the differences, but I have taken SSRI meds in the past and had terrible side effects. Pleasantly surprised to have experienced none with this so far."
10jgmqc,"If you can't take HRT, it's reasonable to try something else, but to require trying antidepressants first for what is a hormonal replacement issue is crazy to me.  They probably get kickbacks for it."
10jgmqc,"The problem is trying antidepressants first, when HRT is possible.

The cause of all symptoms is a lack of sex hormones.


Why would you try ‚Äöplaying‚Äò around with individual symptoms instead of treating the lack of those hormones?


Sure if you are on estrogen deprivation therapy for BC, regular HRT isn‚Äòt for you, though testosterone only is still an option.


But to straight up jump to Effexor? Which is crazy hard to get off of, with massive suffering? Instead of trying safe and easy to quit HRT? All that happens when you stop HRT is peri and menopause symptoms continue developing.

You quit Effexor, you are in living hell. Especially if they don‚Äòt do a proper 6 months taper."
10jgmqc,Please read up on gabapentin before you go that route. The side effects look a little scary for me. I understand the need for finding whatever works for you though.
10jgmqc,"As a pharmacist I can only third this. That drug is hell on earth, and should not be tried before other, more benign options have been tried. The risk of suffering is just far too high."
10jgmqc,"Yeah I don't get it.

And all the pharmacists and cardiologists I saw afterwards said that it's known that it causes high blood pressure. Yet it wasn't in the packaging information required by law."
10jgmqc,"Bzw Effexor also raises blood pressure. If you are not going back to bupropion despite it being effective due to blood pressure concerns, Effexor would not be anywhere close to the first line recommended alternatives.

If you physician wasn‚Äòt aware of this very very common and known side effect, I would recommend finding s different physician for a second opinion."
10jgmqc,Well if you decide to go on Effexor be ready to deal with having high blood pressure again. Most likely your doctor put you on an ACE inhibitor or a beta blocker.
10jgmqc,It varies so wildly from person to person. It took about 8 months for me to first clock my menopausal symptoms and then get to a place with the right kind of HRT and Effexor where I feel much closer to normality. Good luck to you!
10jgmqc,‚ÄòLike me‚Äô. LOL love it!  Hahaha
10jgmqc,"Just to add, lexapro was a brilliant Ned even if I was like a zombie for the first few days"
10jgmqc,"It defies logic. I educated myself. Realized that the benefits far outweigh any theoretical risks and decided that I definitely want BHRT. If a doctor told me ""No"", I would simply find another doctor."
10jgmqc,I think OP is saying she would like to take HRT but won‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs allowed to until they figure out what‚Äôs going on with her dense breast issue. She‚Äôll hopefully have an answer at her next breast ultrasound in 6 months.
10jgmqc,"Yeah; I mean, I would just say ""no thanks"" to antidepressants for hot flashes.  It's your body and your decision.  What is she going to do, refuse to treat you?  More of us need to take charge of our own health care.  Thankfully, I have a doctor who respects that; I pretty much tell him what I want to do or not and what I will and won't take.  Ultimately, it's up to me."
10jgmqc,"Note that I also said this is to also treat mood issues and when i researched, and a few of the people here commented,  this apparently really does help hot flashes and it‚Äôs documented.  My dr. Has said that if this doesn‚Äôt help we will consult a Menopause expert.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm struggling enough to justify this,  I would like to try her options.  Also I want to point out I‚Äôve had ‚Äòsuspect‚Äô mammograms so HRT is not an option so these are the options I have."
10rpflf,"I love dermarolling once a month with a 0.5mm roller. I‚Äôm SO anal about safe dermarolling though! Check out Gin Amber on YouTube for safe rolling, if you‚Äôre interested in building new collagen. It‚Äôs not painful, just slightly unpleasant while rolling, and feels like a mild sunburn for the rest of the day.

Daily I use Vitamin C toner, hyaluronic acid, moisturizer and tinted SPF BB cream in the morning, a retinol serum and restorative cream at night. I also wash with an oil cleanser and then a foaming cleanser only at night.

I take a scoop of collagen in my soup/coffee daily, and also take some daily vitamins and supplements for a variety of issues. Not sure which ones help skin, but I take a B complex, Vitamin D, DIM, NMN, turmeric, potassium, zinc, and a cal/mag.

Perimenopause has been awful, but my skin looks great!"
10rpflf,I follow Hot and Flashy on YouTube. I use a lot of the products she recommends in her morning and nighttime skin routines and I‚Äôve been pretty happy with it.
10rpflf,Differin gel. Like $30. You can get it at target. It‚Äôs a damn near script level retinoid. It‚Äôs labeled for acne. Tube lasts forever.
10rpflf,How much cash do you have? I am an encyclopidia on the subject.
10rpflf,"I have dry skin, but I still use Tretinoin every night. I then slather on a thick coat of Cerave. 

The lip lines will only go away with fillers  (which I am unwilling to try), but laser or micro needling might help soften their appearance."
10rpflf,"If you have access to a dermatologist, I'd go in for a visit. They're so helpful. Retinaldehyde, bakuchiol, prescription cream for my rosacea and sunscreen are current essentials for me."
10rpflf,"Retinol or prescription Tretinoin (also called Retin-A) + moisturizer at night. 1-2 a week I start with glycolic acid, but you need to work your skin up to being able to mix glycolic acid and retinol. In the daytime a vitamin C or other antioxidant serum + moisturizer + sunblock. The reality is that the retinol family it going to be your go-to. I‚Äôve heard good things about Skinceuticals brand, but it‚Äôs pricey. It you can get a tretinoin / retin-A prescription from your family doctor, it will end up being much cheaper and more effective than store retinols."
10rpflf,I am so thankful for this thread - I feel like I need to do something different with my routine and it feels like makeup doesn‚Äôt stay on the way it once did :(
10rpflf,"I have very sensitive and dry skin. I use a Japanese charcoal soap and squalane oil. I also use rosehip oil in winter when I‚Äôm feeling like my skin is dry.  For body I use avocado oil.  I‚Äôm noticing very small amounts of wrinkles on my face which I can deal with so far.  The ‚Äúfrog‚Äù neck that‚Äôs suddenly dropping down and threatening to slowly merge with by boobs is what I really cringe over but the only things that seem to fight that are surgery or eating disorders and I‚Äôm not going there.  

Aging is harder to tolerate than I expected üòÇ"
10rpflf,"I also have 3 short but deep lip lines from half of my top lip that lip stick bleeds into no matter which lip liner I use. I started using a retinal eye cream on my upper lip and it seems to be helping after a month of use. It‚Äôs formulated in a liposome so the product can penetrate well, without irritation. It is the Beauty of Joseon eye revive cream for $10. It takes forever to arrive from Stylevana. I ordered 2 tubes around November and it arrived after December 25. I also use the L‚ÄôOr√©al 10% glycolic acid serum on the upper lip 3x per week."
10rpflf,Good molecules has a wonderful range of inexpensive products. I love the face oils. I‚Äôm fact I love all their products!
10rpflf,"I have learned that we tend to absorb some of our facial bone as we age, so this creates wrinkles around our mouth,  Men have more bone so it doesn't affect them as much.  It appears that there is only so much we can do about it...But I am not going down without a fight!!"
10rpflf,"Pre hrt I had a kind of embalming routine which worked quite well - cleansing oil and a flannel to get whatever off, primrose oil, wait 5 mins and then an inexpensive night cream (oil of olay or garnier lavendar jobby).

Didn't need quite so much after being on HRT for a year - vit c serum at night instead of oil.

Face scrub once a week, face pack when I can be bothered.

Spf laden moisturiser for the day or if feeling a bit ick, another round of night cream.

I've had a couple of radiofrequency treatments at the beauticians (do people say that anymore ?) And had some good results ! Face is no longer racing to slide down my body :)"
10rpflf,"Hyaluronic acid as the main ingredient. It‚Äôs what holds moisture and hydrates the skin, I‚Äôm also taking Hyaluronic acid supplements plus Omega 7 buckthorn oil supplements."
10rpflf,"LED skin mask has started to reverse my skin aging. Received mine in the mail 20 days ago, already seeing results (I‚Äôve taken daily progress pics). AMA."
10rpflf,I like Estee Lauder's night time products.   Retinol causes me to get many red bumps and pimples.   Estee Lauder's Advanced Nighttime Repair serum is the best for me.
10rpflf,A Botox lip flip can help
10rpflf,"Get your hands on some retinol. Cerave makes a pretty good one. I also use their moisturizing cream and salacylic acid cleanser. I love that line and it's not expensive and you can find it at drug stores. Use the retinol 3 times a week to start to make sure you aren't too sensitive, then you can move to every day. The lines should soften, but they won't disappear. Also, wear sunscreen as your day time moisturizer. You could also look into filler for the lines to smooth them out. Gettin old is a bitch, aint it?"
10rpflf,"Palmers skin oil in the day and the retinol some nights, with Nivea BB cream over sunblock if I'm going out."
10rpflf,"As far as topical treatments, Vitamin C (Obagi makes a good product) , a retinol. If you can get Botox, that's great too, IPL laser. The upper lip is tough. Don't put filler in there, you'll end up looking like a duck. Microneedling may help"
10rpflf,"Ditto, been doing Angie's routine for 5+ years now and my skin is much improved.  I go with her recommendations because she trials it first, looks at the science and then compares ingredients with other products that are cheaper, so what she presents as working is fairly trustworthy."
10rpflf,Wow i never heard of her - been watching a number of her videos and she certainly has a complex routine - thank goodness she has a simple one for basic gals like me lol
10rpflf,I assume you are in USA?  It might be a bit trickier (but not impossible) for me - Im in the UK at the moment.   I‚Äôd be very keen to try it.
10rpflf,I dont spend a lot on other things so am willing to make an investment in skin care - not an insane amount though.  if the product shows results I‚Äôd be happy to invest.   Do you think that the more i spend the better the product?
10rpflf,Hmmmm i am wondering about fillers but for me that might be a slippery slope lol‚Ä¶.
10rpflf,Abso-bloody-lutley
10rpflf,Haha embalming routine made me lol.
10rpflf,I have one too! Been using it for almost a year. Gobsmacked by how much difference it's made to fine lines on my neck.
10rpflf,This üñï
10rpflf,It sure is a bitch - but it beats the alternative.   It seams that many people love and trust Cerave. I have started to use these products
10rpflf,Thanks - a lip flip might be a good idea rather than filler?
10rpflf,I apologize yes. I should‚Äôve noted. Try the US Amazon site maybe?
10rpflf,"I just ordered from the UK (after reading this post, thank you all!) via iherb. Seems to ship from the US. Fingers crossed there's no import tax."
10rpflf,"I asked this because some things are better to splash cash on that others.  But the best thing of all is treatments.  I use injectables and other alternatives, but needles aren't most people's thing, so a course of Radiofrequency where gentle heat is applied all over your skin will yield true, long lasting results as it stimulates new collagen.  I brought a home device, there is a top rated one on Amazon for around the 350 mark and you can give yourself a course of 12 treatments and then just once a month.

Ingredients wise, retinol is your best friend. Start at a 0.3% 2-3 times a week and seal in with HA Moisturizing Factors. Both of these are The Ordinany - medical grade at budget prices. Use an oil or balm cleanser in the evening and remove with a channel, which will add gentle exfoliation too. Don't wash your face in the morning, just splash water or a Rose Toner, keep your oils intact.

I'll reply again based on next reply lol. Not too much at once. X"
10rpflf,They definitely get rid of the lines and last quite a while in that location. I was told to stop using drinking straws too.
10rpflf,So you like The Ordinary product line?   I looked at these at Boots today and they had almost sold out.   I use a   Ceravie face wash; drunk elephant retinol some days and then a plain old cetaphil moisturiser.   I need to up my vit c and retinol efforts my top lip really bothers me   I will check out amazon - thanks for the idea
10rpflf,A little bit of botox above my lip works wonders for me. Pretty cheap too. I can't bring myself to do filler there just yet.
10rpflf,"Drunk Elephant is a fantastic brand. Their Vit C Firma is really great. The best vit C from The Ordinary is called Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%. Plain Cetaphil is fine. Look for Nadine Baggott on YouTube, she really covers all budgets. But knowing what I know now I would say buy The Ordinary and put your money into radiofrequency and/or lasers, effective collagen simulators. Alice Hart Davis and The Tweakments Guide is perfect for that info. Bit don't be afraid of DIY on a few gadgets if you use them regularly.  

Oh and the best hyaluronic acids cine from Korea. Nadine covers that too."
10rpflf,The Ordinary 25% Glycolic Peel is very good for once a week/fortnight.  Drunk Elephant TLC Sukari is you want to splash. It is the superior and less irritating but they do the same job. Also in the UK look up Zoe Bee skincare for nourishment. She's an amazing woman.
10rpflf,Just another afterthought because of your dryness try not to overdo the active or take a complete  break from them for a week.x
10w2muo,"Is it bad that while reading this I was thinking cake, champagne, balloons, and everything being the color red except the champagne."
10w2muo,"When I had my hysterectomy 10 years ago I celebrated by buying new white sheets.  

My bleeding was so heavy for so long it was life changing for me to finally be able to use sheets that weren't navy or maroon."
10w2muo,"I love this idea!  
I think it's great to have something to look forward to as well as a reward for getting through Perimenopause. I think a fab party, everyone can dress up in red. Or a trip to a bucket list destination."
10w2muo,"White roses and white pants? Big dinner if you like, with takeaway unless you like cooking? Pictures of happy and wise older women around? A crown of sage on your head?

You go celebrate! Have a hapoy happy day. And that menopause is bad for many doesnt mean it‚Äôs bad for all - or for ever."
10w2muo,"My menopause day is quickly approaching (trying not to think about it too much, because I've been fooled before, but it's literally days away).

My periods were nightmares from day 1....i do feel like I should celebrate. And Valentines being so close, there is a ton of red available....."
10w2muo,"I‚Äôm confused, are you having a procedure done that will put you into menopause?

If not, you don‚Äôt know the date in advance, in fact you only know you were in menopause the day you become post menopausal because for that whole year you‚Äôre just waiting for your period to surprise you."
10w2muo,"I'm flashing back to that M.A.S.H. party where everything was red, they even dyed people's hair, remember that?"
10w2muo,Pink champagne exists?
10w2muo,"This is a goddam genius idea.  I am going to Ice Dye a brand-new dress just for this.  Chartreuse, scarlet, maroon, rose, crimson, and red!"
10w2muo,"I sense from the post that OP is planning ahead how she wants to celebrate, even though she doesn't yet know the exact date."
10w2muo,She can have the menopause party once she‚Äôs post menopausal.   You‚Äôre being obtuslely literal.
10w2muo,">I‚Äôm confused, are you having a procedure done that will put you into menopause?

>If not, you don‚Äôt know the date in advance, in fact you only know you were in menopause the day you become post menopausal because for that whole year you‚Äôre just waiting for your period to surprise you.


Since I record my period dates, I will know when 365 days have passed since my last bleeding.  And since I can math and do calendaring, it's pretty easy to set a reminder for ""11 months since last period"". 

This isn't hard?  To figure out?  It's just simple addition?  And I'm trying to make something positive out of the shitshow that has been dysmenorrhea, surviving in society as a woman, and how Modern Medicine treats peri and menopausal women, so why are you trying to repress that positivity?  

I mean, if I get a period 10 months into the counting, I'll just... start counting again?  This kind of addition isn't difficult for most people, right? 

Also, if I were having a surgery that put me into menopause, why the fuck would I have to tell you about it?  Do you think anyone needs to explain or justify their medical history or personal decisions to you?  

Here it is, in advance:  u/drivingthelittles , I'm pleased to announce to you specifically that, after having been crippled by my period for so many decades, that I absolutely am allowed to celebrate the end of my Menstrating Years, however and whenever that is.  I will be celebrating sometime in the future, between 2 and 20 years from now.  Be there or be square!"
10w2muo,Never saw it‚Ä¶.way before my time
10w2muo,So do pink gummies!  I may get erryone stoned!
10w2muo,OMG love that! You have to share photos!
10w2muo,This is correct.  Thank you for standing up for me.
10w2muo,"Not being ‚Äúobtusely literal‚Äù but thanks for the comment, it made my shitty morning even shittier."
10w2muo,"Holy shit! 
I said I was confused, asked a question and then gave my experience. 
I‚Äôll be sure not to do that again unless im wearing my body armour!"
10w2muo,You're welcome! It's a brilliant idea!
10w2muo,"You didn‚Äôt need anyone to stand up for you, I did not understand what you meant by ‚Äúyou know the date in advance‚Äù hence the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused‚Äù statement and then the question about a medical procedure 

I then shared my shitty experience of only learning that I was in menopause after it was done. This was something that upset me at the time and I was trying to give you a heads up that this is how natural menopause happens - you literally don‚Äôt know until the year is up. 

Have a party, don‚Äôt have a party but I promise you, my comment was not meant to be mean in any way. 

The last thing I need is more shitty comments, in real life or on here. Once bitten twice shy, I‚Äôll slink off and go through post menopause alone before I‚Äôll wake up again and feel like this from a group of strangers who claim to be supportive. 

I promise you all who have left nasty comments that if your goal was to make me feel worse than I already do you have succeeded. 
I can picture a group of high school girls high fiving in the bathroom because they made another girl cry. 

Thanks."
10w2muo,"This woman wants to celebrate when she reaches menopause.   That‚Äôs all.  And your comment was just weird and pretty rude and yes, obtuse and overly literal.   Sure we are post menopausal the day after we reach menopause but that‚Äôs not really relevant for this op.  She wants to have a celebration of that milestone.  Your comment was rude and dismissive and missing the point.  We all have shitty mornings sometimes, doesn‚Äôt mean we should shit all over someone‚Äôs party plans."
10z8bl5,"Needing more research on menopause is an understatement. Getting buy-in from people to participate is one thing and has its own set of challenges from a research design perspective, such as massive, uncontrolled self-selection bias. But the bigger challenge is how to handle the data: meaning, how are the variables operationalized; even tricker sometimes, how is the data treated (nominal, interval, ratio, discrete vs continuous, etc.); how  is reliability and validity going to be handled? And, in terms of conducting sound empirical research, those are things that need to be sorted out and well-defined before you can even think of collecting data, because ideally, all those things need to be driven by a priori hypotheses. The reason these things are so important is because any sort of data collection and usage requires resources, sometimes massive ones, more than people realize, even in the age of the internet with easier data sharing, and it makes no sense to expend all those resources and essentially have data that is unusable, or at least not of sound, meaningful use. I do clinical research. While I think it‚Äôs great to generate a big data base sometime in the future, I think the best and most reasonable fist steps are funded, well-designed pilot studies. Even the most basic variables  affecting menopausal women have scant, quality research. Why is that? Because institutions don‚Äôt value issues that affect women as much as men, so they don‚Äôt get funded. It‚Äôs sad. 

Having said all that, I‚Äôd gladly participate in studies concerning menopause! Sign me up!"
10z8bl5,"I would participate. You freaking need FBI-level investigative skills to ferret out relevant information beyond hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness & mood swings. I'd found one article (somewhere, no idea where, now) about a woman's depression that had her doing suicide ideation, and it was the damn hormones. I'd had no idea, and even though that was where I was at, at least I could attach a reason to it. Until I found this sub, though, I had no clue these other symptoms I was having were even symptoms!!! Or real-life explanations on what even the most well-known symptoms are like-- vaginal dryness? Hello? It feels like I was using fibreglass pink insulation as a tampon. The crap we deal with from our husbands/ partners, and how *not alone* I am in wanting to just slap somebody for dismissing very real and very difficult experiences & symptoms."
10z8bl5,"I absolutely do *not* trust most people with my data. Especially my most personal information about my body. There are a few types of situations I would consider sharing data with, mainly university or nonprofit researchers, but certainly not interested in helping for profit companies or any person who isn't associated with kind of oversight."
10z8bl5,"I'm post-menopause, and I'd be thrilled to participate! I'm still learning about it, in this sub! For example, just tonight I learned that forgetting words is a symptom. I have that in spades! I forget names, and words, even when they were just there, in my head, ready to say? I really thought it was the meds I'm on, but nope! 

When I went through peri- and into post- I could find ZERO information. I even asked my post-meno MIL to enlighten me, and she had nothing to say about it, as if it were some kind of shame, or a big secret, or a big nothing! I have a son, but I am making sure he is educated about ALL OF IT!"
10z8bl5,I would participate too. I hope enough people would want to be included so the data would be helpful.
10z8bl5,"Love this topic and think about how much I want to explore this.  I would LOVE this and on some level would participate if there were assurances around patient data.  At the same time I worry because seeing individual pathways are personalized experiences driven by genetics, lifestyle, environment and what treatments people try and so much more.  So little of our healthcare truly feels like the 4 P's ([https://tech.cornell.edu/news/the-4-ps-of-health-tech/](https://tech.cornell.edu/news/the-4-ps-of-health-tech/)) and we need to move that way; at the same time while we need more research what treatments people have that work for them seem to vary by symptom.  The challenge I have right now is the tracking as much as the treatment options.  Some of the treatments tend to work (magnesium for sleep), but much of this is extremely emotional to deal with, so that 'track your symptoms' when I'm having so many is just fraught with so much trauma and sadness.  And I see where there is fact checking in media outlets (and social media like Twitter) increasingly, and think I would pay to have a plugin to evaluate all the new options in healthcare (or a stock market?) as I see the companies tied to more personalized hormone treatment pop up.  The amount of time required to tackle all of this, however, is just overwhelming, and even finding an app to track my symptoms and treatment and plan my life would be an achievement.

I think though where research studies hold home ('8 out of 10 had this result...') the community aspect would be key - how these symptoms impact and interact, and how we can get to feel more in control of hormonal fluctuations tied to symptoms.  This Reddit is a lifesaver and a way to build more communities in person would also be a huge help.  I'm looking to transition into femtech for a career, and keep an eye out on what advances people are exploring; most of it is tied to fertility but there's possibilities around peri and meno.  We just need to grow all of it.

I think sites like 'patients like me' are getting there, but the holy grail of successful healthcare - access to data and treatment, innovations, access to life stories and community, and ways to manage illness without being overwhelmed - is always going to be a set of duct tape and DIY.  I hope for all of us struggling that starts to change"
10z8bl5,"We definitely need more research.   But that won‚Äôt change the facts that peri and menopause are vastly different for everyone.   

And I think more than research we need education about peri/menopause for medical professionals!    Doctors should know about it!  No one should be told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too young for that‚Äù when they are absolutely the normal age for it!   This is far more important in my opinion."
10z8bl5,"I would rarely say that the government should spend money on something but this is an exception. The CDC ought to do a giant longitudinal study on menopause, HRT, risks and benefits"
10z8bl5,"When I was in peri- I feel into a deep depression, which featured weeks-long out-of-this-world anxiety. My son was 4, at the time, and I couldn't be near him, because I thought I would screw him up. I felt like just my mere presence would destroy him. Not physically, but mentally. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, lost a lot of weight. I finally wound up in an ER, begging the doctor to have me committed. She gave me anti-anxiety meds, and sent me on my way. It was awful; the worst time in my life. It never occurred to me (or any of the other docs I saw), that this was a hormonal event. I'm still pretty heated about it, and I'm still scared, even after 17 years, that I could go to a mental space, like that."
10z8bl5,I had a hysterectomy 8 weeks ago and kept my ovaries. My last bout with pms symptoms after my hysto sent me into a very dark place. It was scary. Thankfully it only lasted around 4 days. I talked to my naturopath about it and thankfully she immediately knew it was hormonal and that my ovaries aren‚Äôt giving me enough estrogen. So we are gonna figure that out once I see my surgeon for my follow up. She‚Äôs like well you don‚Äôt need an antidepressant but sounds like your ovaries aren‚Äôt working all the way like we had hoped. It‚Äôs scary how many doctors don‚Äôt see a correlation!

10z8bl5,"I üíØ agree more funding is needed (or at least different allocation of the existing). They still haven‚Äôt gotten wise to the fact that the productivity of our country as a whole has underutilized resources vis-a-via having enough knowledge (empirically-backed biological AND social science) to provide the resources and support women need and deserve across the entire lifespan. If they were smart enough to think ahead and invest in that, it would pay off in spades. I‚Äôm far from a politically-minded or capitalistic person, but even I know that."

BUT I run slowly and intersperse with walking, and usually run off road. I will do this until I can no longer move as it is the only thing that works for my mental health. Just started estrogen and progesterone patches 2 weeks ago. Not noticed any difference to anything yet, mood or otherwise üôÇ"

Then I found out my 70 year old mother has been running üôÑ tore her meniscus and had to get a total Knee replacement. I couldn‚Äôt believe she had been running. I said ‚Äúeven I don run- I‚Äôm too old
For it!

I‚Äôm Showing her this article"
10uu4xa,"any exercise is good for you, tbh.  I hate running and always have but I do other things that keep my heart rate going, make me strong and make me feel good.  Just moving more and sitting less is good for the mind and body."

10uu4xa,There ya go! You shouldn't be doing it anyway! You know what's nice? A nice walk.
10uu4xa,"I started getting all sorts of body aches nearing the end of perimenopause that were really affecting my running ability. I tried everything: yoga, heavy weights, you name it‚Ä¶ Coincidentally started HRT due to severe hot flashes and insomnia that seemed to appear from one day to the next, and all my body aches disappeared within the week. Perhaps if you feel nothing, that is a good sign that you‚Äôve stopped things before they‚Äôve started."
10uu4xa,"You've just described my entire professional life, thank you."
10uu4xa,"That's my question too. 

Women who lift heavy are dismissed, called masculine, called thirtsy hos for posting accomplishments, and accused of lying about what they're lifting (fake weight!) all the time. It's a subculture rife with misogynist bullshit. OP, please don't contribute to this nonsense."
10uu4xa,"It‚Äôs not even aging, I was in my early 20s when I went into menopause."
10uu4xa,"Hey, nothing lasts forever. Don't forget, if you're here, you already won."
10uu4xa,"Oh gosh, your poor mom! That must've been some meniscus tear -- usually with those they just do an arthroscopic debridement and send you home. Maybe there was bone damage, too.

Yeah, it's unfortunate, the whole American ""anyone can do anything and only weaklings don't!"" business has its time and place but you really have to apply it judiciously.

If people will just think back to the old people they remember from childhood, and what the more vigorous old people did, it really is pretty good clue. I remember old ladies with swimming caps swimming \*very slowly\*. Laps. Not a lot of them. They just kept moving. But they weren't trying to be in the Olympics, ykwim? And walks, walks are good, and when you get very old there's a lot of hats and sunglasses, and then there comes a time when the trip/slip hazards are maybe not worth the wandering around on concrete, or maybe your kid's along to help you, holds your arm. But that's 30, 40 years ahead.

For us, gauging the timing's going to be hard, just because what we've been doing all along is new. There aren't generations of sporty 30-year-old women behind us. For now, the science is what we've got. But I will say that these articles shed some new light on the phenomenon of mountain bikers tending to take a tumble in their 50s and break ribs, collarbones, etc. It's not just that they're falling hard or clumsily, it's that they're falling hard on bones that are already starting to get a bit fragile. 

Which does make me wonder about the old guys who used to pedal home -- oh, of course, they did a lot of physical labor. Farmers and all. Slow bikes, heavy bones, not so much damage if they took a spill. And it wasn't the 70-year-old wives on the bikes anyhow."
10uu4xa,"Right, exactly. I think the evidence is telling us that, ah...we don't last forever. Because that kind of regime is for someone on a sports scholarship at a Big 10 school. 

I don't think it means give up, I think it just means that we're going to have to, you know, coast and ride that aging wave till it takes us under for good. Just try to make it a good ride, all we can do. Personally, I'm looking forward to this new non-sport of tai ch'i, which looks very smart in how it takes you through ROM and light strength exercise."
10uu4xa,"Adding on weights during walking helps too, like ankle/wrist weights, or carrying heavier things in a properly fitted backpack."
10uu4xa,Finger's crossed üòè
10uu4xa,"Well she‚Äôs on Medicare which means they do everything but actually fix it until everything else fails. I‚Äôm still mad she was left to suffer for so long

Personally as a weight lifter I‚Äôd suggest that lack of weight bearing exercise is what causes these lifelong runners to break down- but that‚Äôs my own bias speaking. We know that weight lifting strengthens our bones"
10uu4xa,"Or, alternatively, get someone else to carry all that stuff so you can enjoy the walk more!"
110ob55,"I came here to post this same exact episode! I was so excited to see it, and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre following up on last week‚Äôs article in the NYT. Here‚Äôs their synopsis of the podcast episode: 

‚ÄúMenopausal hormone therapy was once the most commonly prescribed treatment in the United States. In the late 1990s, some 15 million women a year were receiving a prescription for it. But in 2002, a single study, its design imperfect, found links between hormone therapy and elevated health risks for women of all ages. Panic set in; in one year, the number of prescriptions plummeted.

‚ÄúHormone therapy carries risks, to be sure, as do many medications that people take to relieve serious discomfort, but dozens of studies since 2002 have provided reassurance that for healthy women under 60 whose hot flashes are troubling them, the benefits of taking hormones outweigh the risks. The treatment‚Äôs reputation, however, has never fully recovered, and the consequences have been wide-reaching.

‚ÄúAbout 85 percent of women experience menopausal symptoms. Rebecca Thurston, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who studies menopause, believes that, in general, menopausal women have been underserved ‚Äî an oversight that she considers one of the great blind spots of medicine.

‚Äú‚ÄòIt suggests that we have a high cultural tolerance for women‚Äôs suffering,‚Äô Thurston said. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not regarded as important.‚Äô‚Äù

ETA: After listening to it, it appears to be the author of last week‚Äôs article reading it aloud, word for word. Still, I‚Äôm glad they did this in podcast form so that it hopefully reaches more people."
110ob55,I thought this episode was really interesting. Would love to hear your thoughts if you choose to listen.

1134321,"I have almost constant sinus congestion. It's gone from ""period flu"" to ""period Long Covid relapses"" to ""perimenopausal chronic cold symptoms."" Ceterizin and extra B vitamins help.

Anxiety gets worse before my period but is overall better since I started addressing what's behind the anxiety."
1134321,"Someone on these posts had mentioned the connection between peri/menopause hormone fluctuations that can cause **histamine intolerance**. This can trigger anxiety and allergies. 

Perhaps look into taking a strong antihistamine and see if that might alleviate some symptoms."
1134321,"I have post nasal drip I've never had before.  I've never had allergies, but have read they can spring up in peri and I now wonder if that's the cause.  

Anxiety was also a peri gift to me.  My sister felt the same and she actually had a couple of panic attacks."
1134321,"Yes it could be related. This days I get anxiety even just from regular car rides, never had anxiety or panic attack until I started Peri."
1134321,"Post nasal drip is really ramped up, I‚Äôve been blowing through tissues like‚Ä¶ a lot. 

I think too, it‚Äôs contributing to swallowed air. I seem to burp and hiccup a lot, and I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm mouth breathing and sniffing a lot."
1134321,"Every couple of months I get a big flare up for no reason. The first time, I went to an ENT who prescribed a steroid nasal spray, which didn‚Äôt help."
1134321,It‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not alone . Sadly I‚Äôm not done with this battle. Made it 72 days and I can tell I‚Äôm starting again. 50 years old. But horrible anxiety almost to panic and post nasal drip a mess . Maybe time for additional help aside from HRT‚Äôs. It has not been easy for me the last 6 months with hormonal craziness ..

1134321,"This is the part where there's a tissue in every pocket or purse. If you go to like-aged people's homes, there are always tissues handy just like grandma's house had. Went to my ex sister-in-law's for Christmas. She's a couple of years older. I used my pocket tissue and needed another. I said to hubby: There will be a box of tissues near. I was not disappointed."
1134321,"Yes. I have an almost constant runny nose these days. It's to the point where sometimes my nose gets raw from using so much tissue.

Thankfully the anxiety is under control after starting birth control for perimenopause symptoms at the suggestion of my gyn.

However, prior to that it was extreme. I also noticed that the post nasal drip felt worse, which also seemed to make me feel even more anxious. Like it always felt like something was in my nose/throat, which I'd hyper focus on to the point of being unable to sleep. Hard to describe, but it was horrible."
1134321,"Yes I‚Äôve been to an Ent and several sinus surgeries and tried all the pills, maybe I will also look into histamine blocker supplements . Thank you"
1134321,I now understand old ladies when I was younger always having a tissue in their sleeve. I go through 2 full boxes of tissue in a week just from blowing and sneezing.
1134321,"Hi. CBD gummies really help with my anxiety‚ÄîI was having regular panic attacks without them. HRT helps with everything but the anxiety, and SSRIs and SNRIs are a no no for me.

Good luck in finding some relief!"
1134321,"This is me exactly. I have recently upped my HRT and crossing fingers . I am going to another Ent , my right side won‚Äôt drain or in chunks and it has caused severe anxiety , which I think is mixed with my hormone imbalance also"

10m4g8h,"OP get those thyroid hormones checked out. A TSH that high is a very clear indicator for hypothyroidism, which in itself would explain low libido, weight gain, lack of menstruation. 

Only if that has been properly diagnosed, and either excluded or treated, can the low estrogen value be interpreted correctly."

10m4g8h,"Yes it‚Äôs so confusing ‚Ä¶ it could be a completely different reading tomorrow. 
For aches I have been taking magnesium Glycinate which seems to help a little so that‚Äôs worth a shot but I am finding it really tough. 
Best of luck !"
10m4g8h,Collagen and vitamin k2 and vitamin D... For bones and aches...
10m4g8h,"Yay!! I was having a TON of wild symptoms. When I finally bullied my ex-primary doc into requesting testing for me, 2 of my numbers were showing mid-cycle results, and one of them was showing POST menopause, which is when my OB put me on HRT.  
Welcome to the club.   
Hugs"
10m4g8h,These tests aren't really that useful. They tell you your levels at one particular time. They aren't static and could be much higher/lower the next day. Concentrate on treating any symptoms you have rather than worrying about levels. I don't think they tell us much.
10m4g8h,[deleted]
10m4g8h,"Seconding this, that number is super high, should be less than 5, at least here in Canada. I suppose this might be dependent on where you are and how the units are measured."
10m4g8h,Is that maybe supposed to be FSH?
10m4g8h,"I think I need to find a new doctor who will take my symptoms seriously. I truly feel terrible and I need help. Thank you for your input, I appreciate your advice."
10m4g8h,"Curious, is that in a capsule, gummy or powder?"
10m4g8h,"Oh wow I had no idea. My gyn took blood at her office yesterday and sent me these results today. No hot flashes, but weight gain that's been impossible to get off, twin fibroids that have caused hell and bonus no period in over a year."
10m4g8h,"Estrogen would not drop below detection threshold in an otherwise healthy adult, despite it heavily fluctuating throughout the cycle.
And LH wouldn‚Äòt be that high either.


Those tests ARE useful, if you know their limitations: they can tell you, when your levels are definitely too low. They cannot tell you if they ‚Äörelatively‚Äò too low. That is to say estrogen can already be too low for your body specifically, while still appearing within normal ranges; because you tested at the high point for example."
10m4g8h,>Thank you!!!! I will put it on my list. Anything specific stand out for you?
10m4g8h,"It is probably meant to be FSH. In that case, it's totally fine."
10m4g8h,"Could also be in that case: op should just try HRT and see if it improves things.


Though thyroid hormones are standard on hormonal panels here, so it didn‚Äòt seem unusual to me."
10m4g8h,They are capsules x
10m4g8h,"If you've not had a period for over a year (and depending on your age), you want to consider getting a bone density scan.  It's better to know this sooner than later."
10m4g8h,"Nah they aren‚Äòt really correct. The tests are useful.

They just can‚Äòt accurately diagnose menopause when you Estrogen isn‚Äòt low enough yet.

Yours is below detection threshold, that‚Äòs as low as it gets pretty much. Which is clearly menopause range, even at the lowest point during the menstrual cycle this would clearly indicate menopause (or a more serious health problem)

Same with LH being at that level, if you were in the follicular phase of your cycle or don‚Äòt have one. 





Also get that thyroid checked out. It should be somewhere between 0.5 and 5.

Yours is massively elevated, indicating hypothyroidism. (Which in itself would explain the weight gain, and suppressed estrogen production btw)

Your Gyn really needs to test for T4 and T3 and substitute thyroid hormones accordingly.


And then check again once your thyroid levels are adjusted back to normal, whether symptoms persist and estrogen stays this low."
10m4g8h,"Eh, there can be weird variations. I have a friend who is still menstruating regularly, but her hormone tests were about the same as OP's -- they basically told her she had zero estrogen even though she was still regularly getting a period. She does have Hashimotos (mild, not terribly debilitating for her), so that could potentially affect these tests. But that was over a year ago and she still gets a period.

Overall, most important thing is treating symptoms if you have them, not worrying so much about your ""levels."""
10m4g8h,[deleted]
10m4g8h,Ah that makes sense!
10m4g8h,Which ones? Anything you recommend? Appreciate all suggestions.
10m4g8h,"I'm 50. I've never had one of those. Although when I fell on the ice last year and went to the ER, they told me I had arthritis in my neck and knees, after they took an MRI of me, is that a bone density scan?"
10m4g8h,"Thing is the natural hormone range for someone  at 20 is spread so far, that there‚Äòll be some where the normal is low enough that most others wouldn‚Äôt menstruate with their estrogen levels. 

So just because someone‚Äôs uterus is still responding to the minuscule amounts of estrogen, doesn‚Äòt mean they can‚Äòt already be expecting stuff like hot flashes and anxiety.


Though thyroid conditions themselves already directly mess with the uterus anyway, you are right.



Thing is, it would be much more useful; to get a personal baseline of estrogen levels around ovulation and menses at 30, to see how much the levels dropped once symptoms start.


Because the normal range for both the max and min during the cycle is just so wide.

You could be producing just a quarter of your prior estrogen and still show up within normal range. Despite already showing symptoms, and vice versa."
10m4g8h,"Oh yea, I'm gonna love this book. Thank you for your input. I so appreciate you."
10m4g8h,"You can buy them pretty much anywhere to be honest. I take 1000mg twice per day morning and night with food. 
Please check with a medical professional that that‚Äôs ok for you though ! 
Best of luck."
10m4g8h,Have you considered HRT?
10m4g8h,"My friend is 48 and in peri. She just is still menstruating, yes.

In peri, levels can start to go crazy, so, yes, you can show up one day on a test with post-menopause levels of estrogen, but the next week, those levels could be different. There is no one test that can tell you what your actual levels are, because they are so inconsistent, and in peri, you can have basement level readings one day and high readings the next.

A lot of doctors don't worry about test panels and will just give you HRT to treat your symptoms. They just don't matter very much."
10m4g8h,"You may also like reading MENOPAUSE Your Management Your Way by Dr. Barbara Taylor 

She goes through everything about menopause from peri through post-menopause,  anatomy, symptoms, and EVERY choice for hormone replacement from synthetic to natural, and the reasons for each. She talks about prevention of dementia. Osteoporosis. And heart health. 

She also explains this on her YouTube channel, MENOPAUSE Barbie"
10m4g8h,Yes my gyn is supposed to be prescribing HRT.
10m4g8h,"Yes! I know who you're referring to, I am following her on Tiktok and Youtube, she is fabulous!"
10m4g8h,"Ah, cool. I started HRT after missing just one cycle and feeling like maybe I had a couple of hot flashes. Since then? Not feeling any kind of perimenopause symptoms, really. And I do continuous combined HRT in pill form, so I also am not bleeding (other than some very light, very occasional breakthroughs)."
10m4g8h,I agree!!
10m4g8h,"Are you on prescription pills or natural? I'm very curious how you're dealing with this. I've been suffering too long and not realizing what it was, now that I know, I'm diving head first into research."
10m4g8h,"Oh, totally prescription. An estradiol/progestin combo pill."
10m4g8h,"Some people prefer patches or gels because the side effects may be less, but I honestly am having no side effects and my doc thinks pills are generally easier to deal with. Because it's a combo pill that includes synthetic progestin, that has kept the bleeding away for me for the most part (kind of like being on BC and not taking that week break). But some people do cyclical and still get a cycle.

Sounds like you aren't menstruating at all anymore, though, so combined continuous would also probably make sense for you. You should discuss with your doc."
10m4g8h,Fantastic! Thank you for your response. It's nice to know there's hope.
10ipo9e,"My mother went into early menopause at 41 (I‚Äôm 44 and am about six years into peri). She had struggled with her health for decades. I remember her being in bed for most of the 90s. In trying to figure out how to help herself, she turned to the library and research. In her 50s, she was diagnosed with autoimmune disease, in three separate organs. So, she researched again. And found a nutritional way to combat her symptoms. She turned 70 this year and is the healthiest and fittest she‚Äôs ever been. Her and Dad spend three months out of the year backpacking. They walk hours every day. And she puts me to shame with how healthy she is. My point is‚Ä¶ early menopause could be caused by chronic illness therefore leading to a lower life expectancy, but you can re-examine your life, get to the root of the cause, and reset. You can take control. I personally don‚Äôt believe anything is decided for us‚Ä¶ we get to decide. And you do too x"
10ipo9e,"This is very strange, I never heard of any correlation between early menopause and early mortality. Not saying it doesn't exist -- just, never heard. But stick around this sub for a bit, there are plenty of women your age going through it. I am sure they have stories. 

Mine came on at 48, which is not far off. And hormone replacement therapy has persuaded me that I will live forever. Welcome, and good luck."
10ipo9e,"I went into early menopause before 40. I think it takes some getting used to, but I haven‚Äôt heard we need to be worried about how long we will live! 

I‚Äôm in my early 50s now so have had lots of time to get over the shock. One thing that was a challenge was going through it alone, as most of my friends are similar ages to me and still haven‚Äôt started."
10ipo9e,"My mother in law went into complete menopause after the birth of her last child at 27. That child is now 51 and my MIL is 78. MIL washes the car once a week and mops her house twice a week. She has the longevity of a teenager. I‚Äôm 47, in menopause, and I have to psyche myself up to get off the couch.  Don‚Äôt believe all you read."
10ipo9e,"I‚Äôm 45 and fully menopausal. It was a chock and I did not react well lol. Menopause was the farthest thing from my mind, turns out I‚Äôd been in peri for years and no one had linked the symptoms (extreme fatigue, insomnia, vaginal atrophy, a few hot flashes years back ‚Ä¶). 

Give yourself some grace, you‚Äôre likely grieving the end of a chapter of your life, and it‚Äôs ok if you take time to process it. 

I was depressed and felt like a geriatric lady for a good five months. Been feeling my age again (versus feeling like an 80 year old) since I started HRT last October and weight training a few weeks ago. 

It gets better. Hugs."
10ipo9e,I started menopause at 41...it's been so much fun üò≥ü•¥
10ipo9e,My mom was through it at 42 and she is 86 now and doing well.  Her biggest issue is severe arthritis.   I also went through it early and have not heard of the linkage.  What I can say is that I am researching estrogen and cholesterol and that after menopause we become higher risk for heart disease.  That‚Äôs it though!  Enjoy the freedom to not care what other people think anymore!
10ipo9e,"I think I went through early menopause, but not sure because I have different circumstances.

I‚Äôm 44 and have been on birth control pills for over 20 years.  

I started with hypothyroid when I was 39.  

Then, when I was 42 I noticed weight gain around my mid-section I couldn‚Äôt get rid of and a general shift in my weight gain area.  I also started with night sweats at that time.

My special circumstance is that at 44, I was diagnosed with hormone positive breast cancer.  I had a double mastectomy in August and had to stop my birth control pills at that time.

My period has not come back at all since August.  My dr suggests that I could have gone through menopause while on the bc pill.  

So, it‚Äôs a waiting game for me.  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt take HRT, so I‚Äôm hoping I have already went through it.  But, we‚Äôll see."
10ipo9e,Girl I‚Äôm menopausal at 40. It‚Äôs a fucked hand but could be worse. Right there with you.
10ipo9e,Me. I just presume it will take years off of my life to not go on HRT but I feel so awful when on estrogen of any kind that I chose quality of life over quantity I guess.
10ipo9e,"Women in my family trend young for perimenopause: myself, my sister and my mum all started before our 40th birthday. My mum‚Äôs mum is still alive, in her 90s. It helps if stubbornness also runs in your family!"
10ipo9e,"Anecdotal, but here it is. My mom menopaused at 40, she's still alive at 75. Osteoporosis is her only real issue."
10ipo9e,"You could conceivably get a period before that time and continue in peri for years.   It‚Äôs possible.  

Don‚Äôt catastrophisize.   Just take things as they come.   It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs all really fucking hard but we all get through it.   Just take care of yourself and take it day by day."
10ipo9e,Went through menopause at 18. It‚Äôs not been easy but I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm a lot healthier now that I‚Äôm on better treatment.
10ipo9e,My grandma was 89 and went through it early 40s. I inherited that so I feel this so much!!! I realized it‚Äôs time to change my ways and figure out what my body needs and not be selfish about forgetting my vitamins or skimping on sleep. Reprioritizing things for myself.
10ipo9e,"I haven‚Äôt had a long life yet, but I was fully menopausal at 45 and don‚Äôt appear to have died so far. My mom, hers was at 42, still kicking around in her 70s. Her mom had a full hysterectomy in her 30s and made it to 82. And, honestly, we thought Nana was going to outlive us all out of sheer spite. 

Fair warning: I thought I was going to hit the jackpot at 43 and be done with periods once and for all. Had another one after 11 glorious period-free months, then another one six months after that. 

Whatever happens, make one hell of a lot of trouble with your doc if you are having uncomfortable symptoms and they write you off. I waited far, far too long to start HRT and spent years in misery when I could have been doing things like having energy, thinking clearly, and sleeping through the night. 

Take care of the rest of your health and let the chips fall where they may. Quality of life is most important, including now."
10ipo9e,Following.
10ipo9e,I only know about it because my mom had late menopause (60) and at 50 I have no signs. I found out when I was trying to figure out about late menopause because I‚Äôd never heard of it. My mom only told me last year when I told her my last two yearly blood work tests say I am nowhere near menopause. She was like oh you probably have a decade still. Could of used the info before now but good to know. We both also have the longevity genes. I never correlated that to late menopause but maybe it‚Äôs a thing. I don‚Äôt know.
10ipo9e,"There is a link, which is why HRT can be a decent choice in such earlier cases especially if one also has symptoms to manage.  But if one feels no need for HRT, some of that link can probably be mitigated through lifestyle, like heart disease risk can for instance, it's a major killer and lifestyle matters a lot."
10ipo9e,I‚Äôm 41 going through menopause what where some of your symptoms?  Any suggestions?
10ipo9e,Me too‚Ä¶any suggestions?  Advice?  Weight management?
10ipo9e,"Dang! I got diagnosed with hashi when I hit 41 and then all the weight started around my mid section and I cannot lose weight no matter what I do. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, why can‚Äôt you use HRT? I just had a saliva test that showed some eye opening things and I think my doctor is going to put me on a cream"
10ipo9e,How does estrogen make you feel? Might be a dosage issue.
10ipo9e,What HRT where you taking?  What helped?
10ipo9e,"Good info, thank you!"
10ipo9e,"Hot flashes, weight gain, dry skin, and low libido were my worst symptoms. I‚Äôve tried different types of HRT, but none have helped that much ‚Äî and literally nothing helps the weight gain. Surrendering to feeling more tired and doing what I can to eat healthy, set boundaries on my time, and taking naps is probably what‚Äôs helped the most."
10ipo9e,I went on bio identical HRT through Winona... I needed something more than supplements to get me through!
10ipo9e,"My breast cancer was estrogen & progesterone positive meaning it was feeding my breast cancer.  So, my dr will not allow me to take HRT."
10ipo9e,"I‚Äôm on the estradiol patch, progesterone, and vaginal estrogen twice a week (that last one is an absolute godsend for my poor vagoo - after a couple weeks it was already much happier). It took about 6 months of trial and error adjusting the estrogen patch dosage to find the sweet spot. I‚Äôm in a legal state so I used THC/CBD/CBN edibles to help me sleep until we got the estrogen dosage figured out. 

I‚Äôm also super careful about what I eat, drink alcohol very rarely, drink a ton of water, take my vitamins, and try to get active every day. I don‚Äôt know if any of that helps with symptoms, but it helps with bone health and general well being, so why not. 

Unfortunately there‚Äôs no magic bullet hormone combination because everyone reacts differently to things being put into their bodies. This was the right combination for me, but it might not be for other people. 

My first doctor‚Äôs office didn‚Äôt want to prescribe estrogen, so I went through Evernow until I could find a new doc (there is a physician shortage where I am, so it took a while). Evernow was very responsive, but about twice what I currently pay with insurance. I was desperate, though, so it was worth the money to me.

While you‚Äôre in the trial and error phase I highly recommend only adjusting one thing at a time so you‚Äôre clear on what may need to be tweaked next (or not tweaked). It seems like it would take longer but it‚Äôs actually faster to get to success that way because there‚Äôs more clarity on what specifically may need to change."
10ipo9e,Ugh sorry to hear that!!!
10ipo9e,"Thank you so much for your reply. I appreciate it much, as I feel like I‚Äôm grabbing onto strings, trying to figure out what to do in the storm.
Doctors did not believe me when I said something is off I think I need estradiol etc.  looking back hindsight I can see it was peri menopause.  
My FSH is 112 and no menstrual cycle for three months. 
I saw a gynecologist last week who put me on estradiol and progesterone and I can already tell a difference.  I‚Äôm just nervous regarding belly gain and low libido .  
Again, I appreciate all of your advice. I‚Äôm going to be working on adjusting my diet and possibly taking out sugar. I don‚Äôt drink much water but I‚Äôm going to start.  
Thank you!!"
10y8gbj,I use CBD for sleep only.
10y8gbj,"I was having hotflashes 2 every hour, night and day, non stop for 3 MONTHS.  It was never ending. I used 40mg of cbd and 10mg combined in a gummie at night for four days and it broke the hotflashes. I've been hot flash free for a few months but I also have Fibromyalgia which may have been the cause of the hot flashes.  Either way it worked."
10y8gbj,I use it to help with anxiety. But you need to understand that the effects can seem subtle and that for best results you need to take it consistently over a long period of time. I would suggest taking it at bedtime as it can make some people a little bit drowsy. It‚Äôs good stuff with not really any side effects to speak of.
10y8gbj,Which symptoms have people found it helps the most for? My sleep is up and down and wonder if this would help even things out
10y8gbj,I use to use that but now I use Kratom or half a delta 8 gummy.  They work better for me than CBD.
10y8gbj,I use 40mg per serving - just made it myself
10y8gbj,"A friend of mine was using it, and I don't know if she still is but is now on premarin"
10y8gbj,Yes! It‚Äôs my ‚Äúglass of wine‚Äù every night! [select cbd](https://selectcbd.com/collections/gummies/products/select-cbd-bites-chill-bites)
10y8gbj,Nuleaf naturals oil.
10y8gbj,"I went to a CBD shop yesterday. I went for advice about my tennis elbow and came out with a topical lotion and an oil to put under my tongue. The assistant spent a long time with me, explaining how to decide on dosage. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô thing. There‚Äôs lots of advice on their website. They do a menopause specific capsule but apparently the oil gives more bang for your buck so that‚Äôs what I went with.

https://hempwell.co.uk/"
10y8gbj,Doesn‚Äôt do a damn thing for me ‚Ä¶
10y8gbj,Yes for anxiety
10y8gbj,"Yes and I love it. Highly recommend the website, [Project CBD](https://www.projectcbd.org/)  Not selling anything, just research and excellent info. I personally use Healer CBD brand created by Dustin Sulak. Excellent stuff. Available online."
10y8gbj,"What sort?
How much?"
10y8gbj,That‚Äôs great!
10y8gbj,"Very true, it's much more effective when taken over time. I've been using it for over a year and find it very helpful for sleep, anxiety and overall aches and pains."
10y8gbj,It helps me tremendously with sleep. I use CBD with CBN (Joggy brand‚Äôs unwind formula) and I also use RSO THC gummies that I found at my local dispensary. These are the magic keys that unlock sleep for me.
10y8gbj,"Not OP, but I also use a CBD tincture for sleep. Full-spectrum seems to help me the most. Mama Lou‚Äôs and Sun God Medicinals are the brands I like. I take about a quarter of a dropper (edit: ~0.25 mL) under my tongue, and that‚Äôs enough to do it for me."
10y8gbj,"I can‚Äôt thank you enough for this. I‚Äôve been good with magnesium at bed time but am in another ‚Äò3am wake up club‚Äô moment and I need ways to stop that. If you don‚Äôt mind my asking, you felt it was more effective to have both? I‚Äôm a lightweight with much stuff like weed and really worry about finding the right amount to not feel groggy."
10y8gbj,"You‚Äôre so welcome! I‚Äôm happy to help anyway that I can üòä
I‚Äôm the opposite of a lightweight, hence my use of RSOs. The cbd/cbn work fantastically on their own. I took two once and they knocked me into a 9 hour sleep with zero grogginess on waking. One works just fine but I needed extra help that particular day. 
The RSOs I take separately and are wayyyyyyy psychoactive-they get me high as a kite-but they relieve my back pain and send me into a similar sleep as the cbd/cbn gummies, but with a slight grogginess the next day. 
Because you‚Äôre a lightweight, you could try the cbd/cbn on their own and see how they react with your body. I‚Äôm wishing you the best of luck, good night‚Äôs sleep and some overall sweet relief wherever you can find it! üíú"

https://www.larabriden.com/the-curious-link-between-estrogen-and-histamine-intolerance/"
10tjz6w,"All of a sudden I get itchy hive like rashes on my torso and following the bands of my bras. ALMOST everything is made from polyester or spandex!! I went to the dermatologist last year and we all didn‚Äôt know what it was, so he gave me steroid cream which didn‚Äôt help. I changed to free and clear detergent and that didn‚Äôt help. Now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs polyester. I‚Äôm having a hell of a time, though, finding any kind of bra (sports or otherwise) that does not contain spandex!! üò≠

Edit: thank you all for your replies and suggestions! I‚Äôm glad I posted in this community as I felt maybe others had experienced it and had wisdom to pass on. Thank you all."
10tjz6w,"As you head into menopause, your body produces more histamines. Allergies and asthma may get worse. New allergies may develop. 

Sorry. I know it‚Äôs not fun. If you‚Äôre certain it‚Äôs polyester, not the detergent or fabric softener, then don‚Äôt wear polyester. 

Allergies can be hard to pin down. So keep a record of when you‚Äôre having reactions, you might find another commonality besides the polyester. 

You could use an over the counter allergy med like Claratin, Zyrtec, Allegra, or Xyzal. Allegra is the only one that does not cross the blood/brain barrier."
10tjz6w,"If it helps, found this site/store that offers latex-free and spandex-free clothing (including bras): [https://www.cottonique.com/pages/latex-spandex](https://www.cottonique.com/pages/latex-spandex)"
10tjz6w,Did you look in dance stores?   I know they carry a variety of sports bras depending on the store.  I had to buy a few from there for when my daughter‚Äôs psoriasis acts up due to excessive sweating.   If I find any place else or a brand I will pass along.  Currently her psoriasis is not acting up but she just started running in PE so we will see.
10tjz6w,"My skin has become irritated by some clothing too,the bands on bras drive me nuts! Now I‚Äôm taking anti histamine daily as during peri menopause our fluctuating hormones cause histamine intolerances."
10tjz6w,"What about bralettes? Many of them can be found in cotton or other fibers. Also, I feel your pain, my peri allergy is deodorant/antiperspirants and there isn‚Äôt a single one I can find that isn‚Äôt making me have a reaction right now.  I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is I‚Äôm allergic to as even natural deodorants are a trigger. I live in the Deep South and summer is coming and I‚Äôm worried‚Ä¶"
10tjz6w,"I can't wear polyester either, and OMG is it a pain in the patoot to find things without it. Used to be easy...100% cotton tees were the norm. Not anymore.

I have some luck with more outdoorsy places, LLBean, Duluth, etc. Also the new Merino wool clothing is amazing and truly not scratchy. I love it. WoolX, Unbound Merino. Pricey, but well made and worth it in my opinion.

You might also experiment with spandex? I can't do polyester, but I can do spandex, which is a good thing because I don't know what else you can make a bathing suit out of. Although even there, it has become really hard to find ones that are just Spandex and not polyester. But you might be stuck with an allergy to both, which is extra sucky."
10tjz6w,I actually went through my clothing last night and put it all in a pile if it contains polyester or spandex. Which is 80% of my closet apparently. I bought cotton sheets and changed the bedding but the comforter is polyester so I just ordered a cotton duvet. This is upsetting and exhausting to check everything. I‚Äôm going to see an allergist so hopefully we can pin this down what‚Äôs causing my reactions.
10tjz6w,Thank you! I did look at their site last night but I noticed they don‚Äôt carry my size (36D). Although I haven‚Äôt measured myself so the cotton bras may size differently than Victoria‚Äôs Secret or something.
10tjz6w,"Thank you! I‚Äôve looked online like crazy and everything has spandex in it, which if I understand correctly, is made from polyester. I‚Äôm going to make an appointment with an allergist to do some testing so we can narrow it down. Until then, I‚Äôll just be a braless heathen!"
10tjz6w,I‚Äôm sorry that we‚Äôre all suffering but it is comforting to know that my body isn‚Äôt revolting against me alone. Thank you for sharing!
10tjz6w,"Oh, you poor thing! I‚Äôm only guessing at this point that it‚Äôs polyester but I‚Äôm going to make an appointment with an allergist and see if we can‚Äôt nail it down before I buy a whole new wardrobe, bedding, etc. I just found out that panty liners contain polyester which may explain my extreme vaginal itching this whole time!! I even had a biopsy done and there were no issues! This is fucking crazy! Anyways, maybe you can get tested as well to find out the ingredient? We can‚Äôt be the only ones, right???"
10tjz6w,"On the subject of deo.... Tom's calendula it's about the only one I can wear. I forget now what it was that was irritating me, maybe zinc? And for whatever reason the calendula variety of Tom's specifically it doesn't have that in it. So it could be worth comparing ingredients even within the natural brands to see if you can figure out what specific ingredient you're allergic to.

Worst case scenario, plain old cornstarch can help a bit."
10tjz6w,"Have you tried CertainDri for an antiperspirant? Or Lume deodorant. And if you shave, wait to apply anything else to give your skin a chance to settle down. I‚Äôve found the natural products to be more irritating. Good luck."
10tjz6w,"Thank you! These are the suggestions I‚Äôm looking for as there are a lot of clothing companies out there and you don‚Äôt know which ones are sketchy. I bought a jordache cotton sports bra that has spandex. After I wash it, I‚Äôll see how it does."
10tjz6w,I wonder if bamboo is safe for you? I got some bamboo sheets recently and they are very comfortable!
10tjz6w,"I have numerous allergies. When my son was young, I was having a reaction‚Äîitching, sneezing progressing to hives & swelling‚Äîevery time I walked into his elementary school. 

My assumption was that I was having a reaction to someone‚Äôs perfume or something they cleaned with. It had nothing to do with the school. I was having a reaction to Advil & didn‚Äôt realize it until I took one when I hadn‚Äôt been near the school. 

I‚Äôd recommend you keep the clothes until after you see the allergy doc, unless you‚Äôre looking for an excuse to buy all new clothes. 

Even if you haven‚Äôt changed laundry or skincare products, the ingredients could‚Äôve changed and that could be the cause. 

Eventually you get used to checking everything & it‚Äôs your new normal."
10tjz6w,"Have you been over to r/ABraThatFits? There are tons of resources there, and helpful hints (and people!) If you can tolerate bras that use a fiber where there is spandex inside the core of the but cotton wrapped around, so only cotton is in contact with the skin, you‚Äôll find a lot of options. But there are all-cotton ones out there for people with sensitivities."
10tjz6w,"Thank you tooüíö
yes there is a comfort to knowing it‚Äôs not just ourselves having all these weird things happening to us üòÇ"
10tjz6w,"No, it‚Äôs pretty common. I had a friend of a certain age several years ago that developed an allergy to whatever is in elastic, so she had to find socks, bras and underwear without it, and to add insult to injury, not long after that, she developed a latex allergy which sucked because we worked in healthcare back before there were a lot of non latex options."
10tjz6w,"I will try that one, I have two different Tom‚Äôs one is unscented deodorant and I forget what the other is, but it isn‚Äôt calendula.  I‚Äôve been trying to figure out what the common ingredient it is, and damn is it mind boggling looking through all these ingredients even with ‚Äúnatural‚Äù deodorants‚Ä¶"
10tjz6w,"I have no underarm hair, so no shaving. Lume ate up my underarms and underboob. I have a CertainDri product, but I‚Äôm not sure which one, will have to check my ridiculous deo stash of what I‚Äôm currently allergic to."
10tjz6w,"I would think since they are natural that they‚Äôd be ok, but what do I know?? I was wearing all of this stuff a year ago and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs Rash City! I‚Äôm really curious to see what the allergist finds. I hope I can be seen soon."
10tjz6w,Thank you! I had joined that sub in the past so I will ask for suggestions there too. Thank you!
10tjz6w,"It is mind boggling! I just looked at the ingredient list on my calendula deo, and it does not have zinc in it, so I'm thinking that's the ingredient that was bothering me. So that is one to check for!"
10tjz6w,"I feel for you! I always ran hot in every season, and was a super sweater, before I even hit perimenopause."
10x7wvc,"This is fantastic, thank you!"
10x7wvc,Thank you so much for your efforts in researching and compiling this.
10x7wvc,Thank you so much for this. I went on HRT and loved it but have had a BC recurrence. And yet I wish I could still go back on it. Who can I see who would prescribe it to me now. üò´ it‚Äôs like reading about a beautiful chocolate cake and knowing no one will give it to you because you *might* be allergic. Sigh.
10x7wvc,Thank you for taking the time to research and share
10x7wvc,Thank you so much for this!
10x7wvc,"I'm sorry. I do believe this is a tough one. IIRC, in the podcast interview (linked from the document in the post) on Peter Attia's podcast with the authors of the book Estrogen Matters, Dr. Bluming (an oncologist himself) mentions that one whole chapter of that book is specifically about breast cancer survivors, so you could start with that I guess. They said each chapter has extensive references. I believe it is easy to find the book.

There should probably be a whole on-line community/forum (whether a more narrow Reddit sub or on some other platform) just for BC survivors still interested in using MHT. My guess is the number of such people is nontrivial and likely to increase in coming decade or so. Ideally something where some fraction of practicing oncologists & ob/gyns & PCPs participated too (the way both scientists & practicing drs participate on science Twitter and some science-y subs here on Reddit) would be ideal. I don't know of such a forum but neither have I tried to find one.

Weighing the highly uncertain estimates of net health benefit in terms of things like CVD & AD risk reductions (plus hip fracture risk reduction) vs the also highly uncertain mortality risk increase from higher BC and a few other narrow cancer risks seems very hard. Whether or not one could reduce the increased mortality risk from BC through more vigilant & more advanced screening is another good question (as is whether any such increase in screening would be covered by insurance). Good luck."
10x7wvc,Yes unfortunately they don‚Äôt want to do clinical trials of breast cancer survivors with ER+ and HRT. I did read the book and went on HRT and got a recurrence. It is unclear if it caused the recurrence but there is an undeniable feeling it may have grown the tumor. Fed the baby as it were. I‚Äôd love to get back in HRT. Just wish there was another way to fight the cancer at the same time. Sigh.
10yfr40,Sounds like you handled it all very well through your tears which is no easy feat. I‚Äôm sorry to hear you are having such a rough go of it. I remember those crying spells and they are so hard. I did find hormones cleared up all the crippling sadness and crying (and all the other horrible bits). I know they aren‚Äôt for everyone but they returned me to my normal self and I have my life back.
10yfr40,"You do not need to suffer like this through peri or even full blown menopause. There‚Äôs many clinics that are covered by your health benefits that can balance your hormones and have you feeling like yourself again. Reach out to a woman‚Äôs clinic , they are there to help you and trust me it‚Äôs worth every ounce of energy that you invest into yourself."
10yfr40,So sorry you were hit! Talk to your doctor. Zoloft has been a life changer for me. I started taking it perimenopause bc my pms was out of control!
10yfr40,"I just switched insurances and the soonest  new patient appointment for the GP is end of April. I will call the famous women's clinic and see if that's any better, that's a good suggestion."
10yfr40,Don‚Äôt let them or a gyno talk you out of hormone replacement either . The NYTIMES just had a huge article on it and how they are under prescribed. There are several ‚Äú online‚Äù sites too that may be able to help . I know exactly what ur going through. I felt like I was losing my mind . I did not feel like me . Got put on Zoloft by my PCP which helped but my mind would still go haywire . Wasn‚Äôt until I pushed for HRT that I got them . Felt like me again after 3 plus years of suffering. Off zoloft too
10yfr40,"Thanks, I appreciate you sharing with me."
10yfr40,No problem üòâ.
10l8gif,Her situation can absolutely improve .They will offer her vaginal estrogen and if that isn't enough she can add a pill or patch for extra hormones. The sooner she sees a Doctor the better but it's not too late.
10l8gif,"She's in her early 50's she's still young and should be enjoying sex if she wants to have it. The loss of estrogen and testosterone can make it difficult, but there's hormone replacement for that. She's not ""lost her junk"" it doesn't go away, it can and will get thinner and sex can hurt, but again, there are hormones and lubes for that. She needs to be encouraged to speak with her Dr."
10l8gif,"yes, it can improve. i am 55. tho i am not a doctor. a year ago i asked my ObGyn for something because i was experiencing weak bladder (leakage) and painful intercourse (like someone trying to stab my inners). She put me on vaginal Estradiol suppositories. I also tried the ""Julva Feminine Cream"" at the same time. They helped a little bit. As did grapeseed oil for lubrication during intimacy. But sex was still painful - like my walls had fused together painful! i did the vag Estradiol for a year, but was never pain-free. And then because the menopause was coming on strong -- weight gain, skin dryness, and everything else, I sought out a new ObGyn and she put me on HRT in September. I am going on a little over four months on HRT and sexual intimacy has much improved. It is a little bit painful upon insertion, but with attention to using the grapeseed oil during intimacy, i can say it is a world of difference and getting better.

there is also PT for women's pelvic floor. and i have female friends who have benefited immensely from it. i never had kids, so my ObGyn did not feel it necessary for me. not all doctors are informed about pelvic floor physical therapy. in fact i would say the majority are not. or at least are not that helpful with the menopause journey. the estradiol suppository did not work for me and i had to persevere and hunt down a new practitioner.

please tell your mom, ""her junk is (NOT) gone""

check out this website -- it is located in the Los Angeles area. there is a lot of good information on their website and hopefully your mom can find someone local to her. good luck *to mom*!

10l8gif,Just commenting to let you know I think it‚Äôs great you care enough about your mom to help her like this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10l8gif,"HRT helps delay if not avoid heart disease, osteoporosis, and a host of avoidable vaginal issues. My empathy is so strong for the generations before us that we‚Äôre sold a shitload of lies. Basically  brainwashed into a life of fear. Menopausal women need to take HRT for mental health and well being. Hormones are woven into our biology and make the world turn. She will not regret the burst of life the HRT will bring her. I took the combo pill before the patch and I‚Äôm so glad I realized I needed it. I have the vaginal cream and use it only as needed along with progesterone cream. 

A wealth of information awaits anyone willing to step out side the box of their own limitations. I truly understand as my mom is extremely stubborn, also. She‚Äôs blessed to you as her advocate."
10l8gif,"Hi OP-first off, you are a wonderful daughter!

Secondly, as others have stated, science backs the ""use it or lose it"" philosophy when it comes to pain/elasticity. 

Hormones are generally accepted to be the best method to treat issues, but some women can't take hormones for medical reasons or won't take hormones because of their own perspective. A doctor can describe the proper course of action regarding hormones, but there are non hormone solutions (bonafide's revaree, for example.) Also, if you read this channel you will see that in addition to vaginal issues, some women struggle emotionally/mentally and physically. Everyone approaches menopause differently, and there is no right or wrong way, but it is a complex situation with more layers than most people know and your mom may need help/advice beyond the vaginal issues. Good luck."
10l8gif,"You don't need to be penetrated to have sex.

Yes, penis in vagina can become difficult as people age due to erectile dysfunction and vaginal atrophy, but that doesn't mean you can't have sex."
10l8gif,Sorry OP! You are a wonderful child. She's very lucky to have you!
10l8gif,Is there ever such thing as too late? Can the body actually be beyond ‚Äúfixing‚Äù for some people?
10l8gif,I will add that to the post bc I forgot- I have absolutely been pushing her to see a doctor for years now. Thank you
10l8gif,"Was there anything else with your bladder than leakage? And was the leakage hormone related? 

My mom has had bladder problems and I‚Äôm wondering if that could be why"
10l8gif,"Hi im helping my partially blind aunt she is in menapause...So my aunt can use the estrogen creme with synthetic estrogen and progesterone tablets? The doctor said no, do not use them both at the same time and we found that hard to believe!?
You mentioned you were on synthetic estrogen and progesterone? What tablets did you use and what strength? Here is the situation with my aunt she wants a synthetic tablets of estrogen and progesterone..We are looking into activella which is 1mg of estrogen and 0.5 of progesterone(norethindrone) and also angeliq it comes in higher estrogen and the progesterone is (drospirenone) we heard that angeliq is a better tolerated combined tablet but it can raise potassium levels? What name brands of synthetic do you recommened and how does she know what dosage she needs like what hormone helps with what?(the doc is clueless) Also is there estrogen synthetic tablets and progesterone synthetic tablets by themselves(not combined)?Thank you!"
10l8gif,"Son haha, but thank you"
10l8gif,"I know how sex works haha, I‚Äôd assume most men her age would still want vaginal sex which is where her concern is coming from"
10l8gif,"[Nope!](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33038141/) The less advanced the atrophy the easier/faster it is to treat, but believe it or not your mom is still in the younger age group for treatment! 

It's not even just a sex thing - she might never want to have sex again and that's totally fine! She doesn't ever have to have sex. Treating atrophy is about her experience within her own body, not potential sex partners. It is more comfortable for her to have a vagina with a healthy pH, thicker skin, more lubrication and a healthier bacterial community. 

It also helps to keep her urinary tract free of pain and infection, and it helps to keep the skin of her vagina, vulva and perineum strong enough to avoid getting cracks or tears (just from walking around) that might otherwise make her susceptible to infection.  

So on the whole, she is in the exact prime time to get treated for her own comfort and health, even if she never wants to have sex again."
10l8gif,"If so, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case for your mom. 

Localized Estrogen and/or vaginal moisturizer and/or lube. I was just reminded by an obgyn that lube is most definitely not the same as moisturizer. Moisturizer is multiple times a week; lube is for penetration. 

It‚Äôs not too late!"
10l8gif,Yes! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
10l8gif,My bladder leakage has resolved itself. I had two nocturnal emissions (about six months apart) that freaked me the f*ck out ‚Äî this was before I even started the suppositories. The ‚Äúleakage‚Äù was when exerting myself when hiking or exercising or laughing ‚Äî I would lose strength of holding in my urine and emit just a tiny amount. I have read that pelvic floor PT is helpful for that. Estradiol suppositories did help me with the bladder stuff. But I think the estradiol was just not in the form I needed to really get relief vaginally. I am on HRT (a combo of estradiol/progesterone/testosterone) now.
10l8gif,"And, yes, it could be related to hormones (mine was) But I‚Äôm not a doctor‚Ä¶ But there is hope. She needs a good practitioner."
10l8gif,"Yes, my older sister, in addition to vaginal estrogen, went to pelvic therapy and it really helped her."
10l8gif,"Activella was the combo pill I was given. A year after taking, I had a tiny benign mass removed from my dense breast tissue so I switched to patch since it is considered safer. Research states progesterone pill is safer than the estrogen in pill form. No breast cancer in my family but my sister has taken the patch for many years so I wanted to try it. The progesterone seemed to give minor mood swings. Minor bloating with Activella. My GYN annual is in a two weeks but of course nurse stated the only way to know what I needed was by stopping HRT before labs. I‚Äôm using the .075 estradiol at the moment. Vaginal cream helps with UTI‚Äôs and ph balance. I‚Äôm trying progesterone cream for the first time for sleep etc. The combo pill may have caused daytime drowsiness. It‚Äôs truly trial and error it seems like most Rx. So many diseases are preventable with HRT according to research. Mild osteoporosis shown on my bone scans already at 54. This is not medical advice. Please do your own research."
10l8gif,"Oh my. You‚Äôre a son, no less! Well, for heavens sake, that is so great!!!"
10l8gif,">I‚Äôd assume most men her age would still want vaginal sex which is where her concern is coming from

Why would you assume that? ED is becoming common at that age and so they may not be capable of penetrative sex either. But even if they are, why assume that PIV is necessary or even preferred? Also, why assume that the man's wishes are the determining factor? That seems a bit silly."
10l8gif,"This is exactly correct.   Also, since she is single and not seeing anyone she should seriously look into getting a vibrator or dildo.

The saying ""Use it or lose it."" is completely true.  And she can start hormones to feel more comfortable and then introduce ""play toys"".  This will also help once a future partner comes along."
10l8gif,‚Ä¶because that‚Äôs the same assumption my mom is making??

10ena4l,"So so SO much worse.. Everyone talks about pregnancy, but this‚Ä¶why is this so taboo?"
10ena4l,"I have been beating this drum for 25 years. My therapist,  who is retiring and leaving me at the end of the month, said that in his 30 years of practice, he was astonished at how little the subject came up. 

I went through peri-menopause right in front of and along with my psychiatrist AND while under the ""care"" of 4 different GYNS over the last 20 years and none of us picked up on it!!

I could scream."
10ena4l,Antidepressants should not be first line tx for peri or menopause. HRT and somatic therapy first. I‚Äôm with you and I stand for your well-being.
10ena4l,"I‚Äôm almost 41, possibly started peri in the past  year, and WOW my mental health has tanked. I‚Äôm so very grateful for this subreddit and these discussions, bc at least I‚Äôm prepared for the worst! I won‚Äôt hesitate to do HRT and/or prescription anti anxiety if it gets really bad. I wonder if there‚Äôs any preventative things I can do now (other than a good therapist, walking, yoga and mediation?)"
10ena4l,"I‚Äôve been a mental health nurse for over twenty five years. I‚Äôve sat in on literally thousands of psychiatric assessments with a psychiatrist. Only once did I witness reference being made to menopause transition symptoms. It was many years ago. He wrote a diagram for the woman describing how first-time hospital admissions are highest for women between 45-55. I did speak to one of the female psychiatrists about my surprise that this wasn‚Äôt routinely explored. She agreed, and to my pleasant surprise, the next time we saw a patient together, that became the second time the menopause was considered by a psychiatrist ‚Ä¶in my full 25 years!"
10ena4l,"I wonder if the profession has pushed the mental health/menopause connection far, far away because they want to separate themselves from the many hospitalizations of women for ""hysteria"" back in the day? It just doesn't make any sense to me. No, we don't want to go back to those days, but could we at least get a little attention paid to the issue?"
10ena4l,I guess I'm a rare lucky one. My regular gyn was all over this with me.  She calls me out and has helped me so much!  I did end up with antidepressants after exploring options and it's been a game changer for me.
10ena4l,"No, I don't think they are. Have you had any lab work?"
10ena4l,Seriously. My mother bought me a book about puberty when I was 8. There was certainly no lack of information about pregnancy. But menopause? Crickets.
10ena4l,"But antidepressants are the first line choice for any ""female"" complaint. They definitely are for thyroid problems."
10ena4l,"When things got very bad for me, getting on a personalized regimen of supplements helped a lot. Not sure if it‚Äôs something that can serve a preventative or protective function?"
10ena4l,Wow. I am saddened but not at all surprised.
10ena4l,"I suspect this is very much what it is about. The pendulum has swung too far. Regardless of how the symptoms are being framed, people of menopausal age are still at high risk of hospitalization! Let‚Äôs just be honest about what‚Äôs happening, I say."
10ena4l,"All I‚Äôm saying is that they should not be. They often worsen the issues we want to treat, like low libido, weight gain, and clitoral atrophy and numbness. This pisses me off so much I can‚Äôt even."
10ena4l,"No, they definitely should not be. All I'm saying is that they are the first choice of doctors for medical complaints from women. I've spent a lot of time on thyroid forums and the majority of women say that they were first offered antidepressants when they complained of thyroid symptoms. I was and when I said I felt even worse and was gaining weight for no reason, I was told I just needed to double my dose. It is infuriating, but I won't worry my pretty little head about it."
10ena4l,"I‚Äôm going to worry my pretty little head over it.
antidepressants almost killed me, and of they almost killed me, they‚Äôve definitely killed some people.
I‚Äôm so glad you shared your thyroid experience. I have a friend who had a similar experience and she almost killed herself.
It sucks we must battle for HRT and thyroid meds. All my best to you!"
10tp2lt,"Hi there. If I have understood your post correctly, you‚Äôve missed only one period thus far at age 50?

ETA 1: I may have not understood but if I did, then my own opinion would be yes, unfortunately, you need to use contraception because how can you know if you won‚Äôt get a period again in a month or two? The established consensus appears to be  one year without periods. 

(er, assuming there‚Äôs nothing else going on, although considering your age and your peri symptoms, it doesn‚Äôt seem likely; I just mean, if you said you were 30 and you‚Äôd gone a year without periods, menopause does not seem like the only likely scenario; I digress.)


ETA 2: that said, are condoms really off the table? Because of course, not only are they easy, you‚Äôre protecting against sexually transmitted diseases as well as preventing pregnancy, but also there seems limited opportunity for adverse side effects / discomfort such as you describe with iud/coil, hormones, etc."
10tp2lt,"Yeah, you‚Äôre kind of tempting fate if you use zero protection. Especially as it‚Äôll be hard to tell whereabouts in your cycle you are if it‚Äôs becoming irregular."
10tp2lt,"Yes, you still need a plan to prevent pregnancy."
10tp2lt,"You are NOT menopausal.    You‚Äôre in perimenopause.  Menopause is when you‚Äôve had no periods for a full year.   

Please read this subs wiki page to find out more about perimenopause.   And you do need contraceptives until you actually reach menopause."
10tp2lt,"I think you answered your own question. I know of a few people who got pregnant at 50, I personally didn‚Äôt think it was worth the stress so I used condoms. Polyurethane (Skyn) helped with issues re an aging vagina and using condoms. 

With continuing weirdness around your cycle do you really want to add pregnancy stress?"
10tp2lt,I'm married and I just got my mirena out in December.  Then ugh had a period Jan 1.  Cramps and nothing a couple days ago so I think that was something.  My libido is still strong.  Definitely starting birth control.  I don't need any surprises and neither do you.
10tp2lt,"My great aunt got pregnant at 52, baby at 53, after 18 years of secondary infertility. Yes, it's rare. Also yes, it can happen. Whether you 'need' contraception depends on how much you like gambling."
10tp2lt,I am fully post menopausal and in my 40s. My GP says I will need contraception until I am 55. I think it would be sensible to take precautions for a while ...
10tp2lt,"I‚Äôm 4 years post menopausal‚Ä¶ with my tubes tied‚Ä¶ and we are still cautious and use protection!  The last thing this 47yo, post meno woman needs is a baby!"
10tp2lt,"Yes I am 50 and so far have only missed one period. This is big for me though because my periods have been so reliable ever since they started.

It‚Äôs ok. The missed period was BEFORE any activity and more than two weeks after I would have ovulated. Also, no pregnancy symptoms.

I should just bite the bullet and go with the condoms. I know."
10tp2lt,Wait. That's a little weird. Four years out from full menopause? Plus tubes tied??? There is zero chance you're getting pregnant. It's silly to still worry about contraception when that's one of the benefits of menopause -- not having to worry!! What makes you think it is even remotely possible a woman in menopause for four years is getting pregnant?? Are you going to use contraception when you're 75? Lol.
10tp2lt,"Um. Missing just one period does not make you menopausal. You are very likely in peri but you can't say you are in menopause until you've missed a full year of periods (barring any other reason for missing them such as medical issues or taking consistent BC, etc). Your odds of getting naturally pregnant at age 50 are astronomically low anyhow, but why take even a minuscule chance of disaster?"
10tp2lt,"Well, hey, I hear you though. but if that bullet can be bitten, bite it, I say! üôÇ"
10tp2lt,I‚Äôm just saying we don‚Äôt want to risk having a baby. No need to make fun of me.
10tp2lt,"Also, this woman was 7 years post menopausal‚Ä¶ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299412/"
10tp2lt,"I'm not making fun, but I HONESTLY do not understand. Menopausal women do not get pregnant. That doesn't happen. One of the great things about being in that stage of life (and FOUR years on) is that you no longer have to worry about birth control."
10tp2lt,"Oh, for fuck's sake. This is a total freak incident. But OK, sure, we'll all just use BC until we're 85 years old. Come on. Menopausal women are not fertile."
10tp2lt,"This page is the one place I can go to feel safe.  I come here and feel like I am in a supportive community of women who understand what I‚Äôm going through.  Let‚Äôs keep it that way.  If you don‚Äôt like my choices, just move along."
10tp2lt,"The study says they found over 700 post meno pregnancies in a 20 year time span.  The possibility is very small, but it‚Äôs not 0.  Why are you arguing with me about my choice to use birth control?  It doesn‚Äôt affect you in any way."
10tp2lt,It seems like some kind of denial. As if you are still clinging to being young and fertile even if you are four years past actual menopause. The chances are basically zero -- those odds are far less than 1%. But whatever.
10tp2lt,"I would also guess that in cases like this, there is some weird shit going on/the women thought they were in meno because they stopped bleeding, etc., but they were not actually in full meno and there was some other reason they thought they were. Something was off. It isn't really physically possible to get naturally pregnant once you are in menopause. It just isn't.

But OK, again, whatever. Do you. It's just sad you don't get to enjoy one of the actual benefits of being post-menopausal, which is not worrying about pregnancy."
10tp2lt,And you have an uncontrollable need to control other people‚Äôs decisions.  So we‚Äôre even.
110tv9i,YES!! Someone mentioned it in another post. Fabulous! We are making inroads!!!

10sb977,"Same here, worsening anxiety and developed PMDD over the last couple of years. I've been started on HRT, estrogen only for the first month and then introducing progesterone for 2 weeks a month. It's like night and day. I'm only on my first estrogen patch and I already feel like myself again. We're moving house next week with all the stress that involves and I'm chill, able to get stuff done, anxiety is gone."
10sb977,"My pmdd was off the rails in perimenopause.  My cycles were 25 days so I was just constantly ovulating and cycled between periods of mental anguish, and rage. It was actual hell just being trapped in my head."
10sb977,"I was diagnosed with PMDD at 40. It worsened as I got older because of the hormonal fluctuations. Also, PMDD is so vulnerable to stress ‚Ä¶ and there are quite a few around midlife aside from what hormones are doing. If I could give one tip (apart from the usual stuff) based on my own experience, it‚Äôd be to make sure you never grow hungry, especially if you have a tendency for irritability/anger. That was an absolute red flag for me when I was stressed. Having a banana was like taking a Valium!"
10sb977,The only thing that has helped me is a low dose bc pill. My pmdd rage is gone.
10sb977,"I had my ovaries removed last week @44yo. Peri made it all üíØdebilitating. I felt instantly better after 30yrs of living with pmdd. We‚Äôve already adjusted my BHRT 3 times in a week, which was rough. I‚Äôm a very sensitive creature, which is good because the doctor and pharmacist were able to adjust quickly based on symptoms. What we found is I don‚Äôt tolerate as much estrogen, need 100mgs of progesterone and a nice dose of testosterone which is making me feel good. I‚Äôm happy with my decision and am looking forward to a pmdd free life!"
10sb977,"Yes, while I certainly always have had PMDD, I experienced a worsening of those symptoms when I was in perimenopause. (I did not realize that is what it was at the time.) also my ADHD issues / executive functioning issues intensified."
10sb977,Estrogen becomes dominant when progesterone drops more significantly then the estrogen drop.  I'm trialing chemo meno because I don't tolerate bc
10sb977,The difference is amazing once the hormones start to even out. I don‚Äôt think enough doctors have the confidence to prescribe HRT for this sadly
10sb977,"Right?!  I‚Äôm going nuts. My cycles are not predictable so I keep getting caught off guard. What did you do? Did it stop eventually? With actual menopause, if you‚Äôre there?"
10sb977,May I ask you which bc pill you're taking?
10sb977,I am so happy for you! Much admiration as it can‚Äôt be an easy choice but I 100% think this should be an option on the table for anyone who feels PMDD is severely limiting their life. üíú
10sb977,I agree that they don‚Äôt. Just as they don‚Äôt seem to have much to offer for PMS/ PMDD during the menstruating years (prior to peri).
10sb977,"I knew I was going to demand a hysterectomy in my 40s but I knew it would be a fight. So I started in on it when I was 42. 

My cycles were always on schedule and I tracked my cycles obsessively so I wasn't caught off guard with the timing. However I was usually caught off guard with the intensity of emotion shift. 

I highly auggest tracking your cycles with an app. That is very helpful. I also suggest stopping eating carbs and sugar and alcohol during your luteal phase. The inflammation made everything so much worse for me. Magnesium and D3 are helpful supplements.  I manage to get all the side effects from medication so I typically,  and unfortunately, self medicate. Alcohol has been a disaster for me through many years so at this point I'm pretty dependent on Marijuana.  To sleep, to be calm, to organize my brain. 

No, it didn't stop. I was a rage filled hysterical mess with very little mental control. I also had physical pain and heavy bleeding.  Took two years of planning with an endocrinologist and I had everything removed. All of it. I would not have lasted through the mental anguish for 10 more years. 

So I got thrown into surgical menopause immediately.  A lot of women hate being in menopause.  I, however,  feel free."
10sb977,"I am now in second year of menopause and I do find that the PMDD is no longer there. Which has  been a relief. 

But I have still had very bad issues with my executive functioning and my ADHD  and have found that my lifelong coping mechanisms have fallen short for the first time ever. (Well, arguably, my coping mechanisms were not the ideal ones to begin with, but at least I could always get things done in the end.  COVID life and working from home appear to have added to the difficulties.)"
10sb977,"At some point before i entered menopause, in the late stage of peri, I cursed myself for not having seriously considered having everything taken out (ie, not just the uterus but the cervix, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes) long before. 

But cursing myself was not helpful since a, nothing to be done to change my past and b, it‚Äôs hard to see me not being too afraid of all the risks (not to mention that most if not all docs would likely not have consented to removing everything.)

But I applaud you! I believe PMDD really limited me."
10sb977,What did you do for the other stuff?
10sb977,"Ha. Well‚Ä¶ to be honest, so far I‚Äôve only done two things. 1) my doc increased my dosage of adderall and changed it to XR instead of non-xr; 2) I‚Äôm trying to eat regularly and BETTER (as in, not just protein bars): vegetables, for instance.

I suppose there‚Äôs a third thing that has helped in many ways but it was not my choice: I was fired in October. üòñ (I am married and my partner works so, for now it is ok; I know that is not the case for everyone.)

While I (really do) fear that I may never be hired again and have no current idea what I am going to say when they ask me why I left my last job (I mean‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwell, I became incompetent.‚Äù?!), something had to give because I had run myself into the ground while also messing up and I was in bad shape. 

Ha. So, that‚Äôs the answer. Not sure how helpful, practical, or encouraging any of that is for you, though. 

It is because of my history of PMDD that I am very anxious about starting HRT. I do not want it to come back. 

If you do not currently take any medication for anxiety and/or depression (I do and did well prior to perimenopause) and are open to that consideration, that is something that might help. 

If you don‚Äôt exercise, you could try exercising. If you already do exercise, you could try more of it. (I myself haven‚Äôt made it to that level yet but it‚Äôs on my list.)

Finally, if I were in your position, I would talk to a provider, preferably one from the NAMS list (if you‚Äôre in Canada or US), about your options. There may be more than you think. I know some women take birth control to help make the PMDD /PMS bearable. (There appear to be a range of experiences with this.)

I found this and it made me hopeful: https://iapmd.org/menopause. You have to scroll down a ways to get to it, but it says ‚ÄúPMDD experience abnormal negative emotional reactions during hormone changes. However, recent studies ALSO show that these negative emotional reactions usually go away about one month after starting HRT ( https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.16101113). Therefore, if you can tolerate the symptoms in the first month following the start of HRT (or any changes in HRT), symptoms usually subside. ‚Äú

The study they link to looked at only 22 women‚Ä¶ but the idea that PMDD/PMS may have more to do with fluctuating hormone levels and not *steady* hormone levels seems logical to me. 

But when I tried low-dose bc about 25 years ago, I felt like it made me feel crazily moody and I went off it immediately.  Maybe if I had been able to stay on it more than a month‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know."
10sb977,"Thanks for this long response, thanks for taking the time.  That means a lot, and good information too."
10iqzh4,"Thanks for sharing ‚Ä¶

Her song ‚ÄúSilent All These Years‚Äù has been on repeat through peri and these lyrics are especially poignant:

‚ÄúYears go by, if I'm stripped of my beauty 
And the orange clouds raining in my head‚Äù"
10iqzh4,"Oh wow, I used to love her so much! Cornflake girl getting hot flashes!"
10iqzh4,"There is a KCRW benefit album from forever ago with live version of Silent All These Years that opens with Leonard Cohen reading a poem - if I remember correctly:

I heard of a man who said words so beautifully 
that if he only spoke their name
Women would give themselves to him.
So if I am silent 
It is only because I heard a man climb the stairs 
and clear his throat 
outside our door."
10iqzh4,"In one of the toilets in my Oxford college someone had written ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a woman to look after me‚Äù (women‚Äôs college, many lesbians). Underneath someone had written ‚ÄúYeah, your mum‚Äù üòä"
10iqzh4,"And to think, she‚Äôs been Silent All These Years."
10iqzh4,"There's now a graphic novel available based on Little Earthquakes (or at least one of her early albums). Haven't bought it yet, but it looks very interesting."
10iqzh4,"I listened to her so much to the point I burned out hard on Tori. It‚Äôs been a long time since‚Ä¶ where are my CDs, it‚Äôs time to revisit! 

*This is not, this is not happeningggg*"
10iqzh4,She has long been my absolute favorite - but I took a pause after the American Doll Posse - it just didn‚Äôt do it for me.  The newest album - Oceans to Oceans - is one of the better recent albums along with Native Invader.  Both are pretty political but I appreciate the no fucks given approach she takes.
10iqzh4,*You bet your life it issssss...*
10iqzh4,"I'm listening right now off YouTube and I remember every word. It's insane, I'm so happy singing loudly in my house!"
10iqzh4,"Oh, yesss, there is something about her that is prone to bringing on ""burn out."" I LOVED her in college and then began to get extremely annoyed by her, like she was almost a caricature of all of the worst about the Lilith Fair crowd. But now, with some distance, I think I can appreciate her in a different way."
10iqzh4,"Sometimes listen to her earlier stuff again (I am old) but A Sorta Fairytale is still on my regular playlist. Saw her in 1998, Unbelievable Truth opened for her. Was an amazing show."
10iqzh4,I agree with the ‚Äúburn out‚Äù from listening to her so often throughout college and again in my late 20s into early 30s.  I can appreciate her music and artistry from several steps back.
10jm5xf,"I would insist on a neurologist consult. These symptoms are not something I would typically associate with menopause and I would also insist on fairly extensive bloodwork to identify any deficiencies such as vitamin D, potassium, sodium, etc.  Menopause just sounds like an easy out for what sounds like an atypical medical situation. Good luck, pushing doctors to dig deep can be a giant pain in the ass."
10jm5xf,"Really strange! Does it happen after she eats? Im assuming they checked her for diabetes?

If they have ruled out anything neurological, take a look at this, 

https://www.healthline.com/health/auto-brewery-syndrome

I came across this quite awhile ago. It's probably not that, but it's interesting none the less."
10jm5xf,Are you absolutely sure she's not drinking? I know some highly functional alcoholics who were able to hide it from their family for years.
10jm5xf,Could it be auto brewery syndrome?
10jm5xf,"No doesn't sound like menopause (The slurred speech afaik is not a menopause symptom). What about myasthenia gravis? Is she warm when these episodes hit? Does she have problems swallowing as well? What about labored breathing?

Whatever the cause, you are right to be concerned, please insist she take it seriously and see doctors until they figure this out! You may want to go with and advocate for her, as well as be able to explain what you see when it happens."
10jm5xf,"I would check with a neurologist about whether it could be an unusual type of epilepsy. Also write down everything you remember and start a log, and try to identify any triggers,"
10jm5xf,"I just wanted to say I'm going through something similar. I'm in my early 60s. Mine started after having the second Shingrix shot. Medically, everything has been ruled out from autoimmune to neuromuscular, and anything sleep related. I do have an autoimmune disease and it can cause neurological issues but nothing resembling this. The neurologist thinks it may be caused by a silent migraine but my symptoms don't really match up. I do have migraines though. One is a very rare type that looks like a stroke but isn't. However, the symptoms from the Shingrix related ""episodes"" are very different from the infrequent migraines.  It's important to recognize that there are migraines that will have symptoms like you're drunk and hormone changes just exacerbate everything. That's where a skilled neurologist comes in and you may have to shop around.

I wish I had the answer for you as it's terribly unsettling. My guess is it's something migraine related. I wish the best for your mom."
10jm5xf,"In addition to the ideas others have, I'll add another possibility: Munchausen's Syndrome (Factitious Disorder [edited for spelling error]). You are in your early twenties and looking at your post history, you've got a lot of signs of being parentified. Her having an unexplained illness could be attention seeking behavior (selling attention from doctors and from you)."
10jm5xf,"I hate to say this but it sounds like it could be a stroke. My father had all these symptoms during his strokes. I hope she gets answers and feels better soon.

He would go from normal baseline self to slow speaking and slurred words. His face would also twitch and sag on one side. ( he‚Äôs better now. )
You should take her to a neurologist to rule out any brain / blood barrier issues."
10jm5xf,"I agree that she really needs to see a neurologist. I am sorry to scare you with this because I know you are already very worried but the slurred speech and difficulty walking were the first signs of my father‚Äôs ALS. If anything, it would be good to just rule a neurological reason out."
10jm5xf,Otolaryngologist!? Neurologist ??
10jm5xf,"Thank you. I agree. Her vitamin D, potassium and sodium are fine as they were checked a couple of times. Her thyroid was fine too and that was checked a couple of times as well. I heard vitamin B deficiencies can sometimes cause issues, so I got her a complex B-vitamin tablet to take each day, but hasn't changed anything and she's been on it for a few months. I am quite concerned that it's something neurological like MS, ALS or myasthenia gravis. She has faith in our GP, but, I stress to her that even the most competent doctors can be mistaken. I have no idea what to even say to her to get her to consider otherwise."
10jm5xf,"Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post. It doesn‚Äôt happen after she eats, actually, not eating can make it slightly worse. I invested in a blood glucose monitor and measured her blood glucose before and after eating and it was within normal ranges. I did it quite a few times and all fell within normal range. Her HbA1c has been fine too. Interestingly, auto-brewery syndrome was actually something that I had read about, but doesn‚Äôt seem to fit her symptoms."
10jm5xf,"Yes, I bought several urine tests to test for alcohol and I‚Äôve been in the room with her when it‚Äôs started to happen. So the chance is very very slim."
10jm5xf,"Thanks for the suggestion, I‚Äôve previously researched into it. My mum will eat a lot of carbs during the day (and at night) but it only happens at night. It doesn‚Äôt seem to fit the pattern of auto-brewery syndrome. It seems to be exacerbated by periods of tiredness or stress."
10jm5xf,"Thank you so much for your reply, I am oddly comforted by it. I hope that does not come across as insensitive, but you are the first person I've come across that actually has had similar symptoms as my mum, and I am sorry you are going through something similar. We have found a great neurologist, we are just waiting for his secretary to get back to us what day she can see him for an initial consultation. It should be within the next 2 weeks!"
10jm5xf,"I have health anxiety (and had an extreme health anxiety spiral a couple of years ago), and I‚Äôm in therapy. I don‚Äôt see the signs of malingering or Munchausens and nor has my psychologist or therapist. Although I‚Äôm no doctor, I‚Äôve been fascinated with Munchausens/Munchausens by proxy and it just seems highly unlikely. I feel like a more likely manifestation would be a psychogenic or psychosomatic, with something like FND."
10jm5xf,"Thanks for replying back to me. If you don‚Äôt mind me inquiring, did your father have multiple strokes? If so, over how long of a period? Once I got the money together, we are going to go to a neurologist. I decided to record her during an episode and showed my mum a video of herself slurring her speech and she didn‚Äôt realise how bad it was. So it‚Äôs moving in the right direction."
10jm5xf,"Sorry to hear about your father. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking. Did your father have episodes of slurred speech and difficulty walking? Or did his speech and difficulty walking progress steadily over time? 

We are searching for a neurologist in our area."
10jm5xf,Contacted the neurologists secretary. She is going to arrange an appointment within the next 2 weeks.
10jm5xf,Try a B1 only supplement. This can be depleted in alcoholics and cause long term damage leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
10jm5xf,"I hope they get to the bottom of it. How upsetting! 

Have you looked into possible epilepsy?"
10jm5xf,That's very scary. I hope you find some answers soon and post back!
10jm5xf,"Yes, def could be those, too. Or migraine. Or long Covid. Or asthma. Or stress. There's a lot it could be. But it's been a year and she's not been diagnosed? That's when you start looking at other potential things with specialists (not online forums). 

(Also neither you nor your therapist are in a position to be able to assess your mom. My therapist is a diagnostician - literally teaches that at a university level - and cannot diagnose my mother. You can't diagnose some one unless you are working with them. We can speculate. Which is what I'm doing.)"
10jm5xf,"He was acting strange for a few years. My mom brought him to a neurologist and they ran tests and an mri. He had had at least one stroke. He has had a few mini strokes since but his meds seem to be working. He acts normal usually , but he has dementia now . His first stroke was around 70 years old, he‚Äôs 80 now. Please get your mom checked out hopefully it‚Äôs not a stroke, esp since she‚Äôs relatively young.
He had a few strokes (3?) before he was diagnosed. He‚Äôs stroke free now."
10jm5xf,"I wasn‚Äôt living with him at the time so I don‚Äôt remember if there were episodes before full blown symptoms. I do know he fell down the basement stairs about a year before diagnosis so there is a chance that could have been an episode long before the other symptoms. I remember talking to him on the phone a few times before his diagnosis and thinking he sounded drunk which would have been way out of character for him. It confused me at the time and I didn‚Äôt comment on it, but he and his wife eventually took him to a neurologist after a few months of this symptom. He was kind of private about his health so I don‚Äôt know what the other early symptoms were. Probably weakness in his arms for one and I think he mentioned twitching and leg cramps at night.

From my understanding, there are two types of ALS in general. One effects more of the upper body and speech first and the other effects the lower body first. My father had the first but I have a friend whose father had the other. 

Of course there are other neurological diseases that probably have similar early symptoms like MS or Parkinson‚Äôs.

I wish you the best of luck and I hope for her sake it‚Äôs just hormonal because that can be corrected."
10jm5xf,"I‚Äôve heard of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. However, she has not drunk in a decade. Her current B-vitamins have 100mg of thiamin in."
10jm5xf,"I have - but it doesn‚Äôt seem to match up with the symptoms. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs something like FND? I‚Äôve searched through Reddit, asked on r/AskDocs and other subreddits and I‚Äôm just at a loss. I‚Äôm just desperate for someone who‚Äôs had similar symptoms to somehow find these posts and point us in the right direction."
10jm5xf,"No, no diagnosis. It‚Äôs causing me a lot of second-hand stress but she does not seem to be too concerned and is happy to go with menopause being the reason. Almost selfishly, I want to get to the bottom of it for my sanity and peace of mind. Nevertheless I do appreciate the time you‚Äôve taken out your day to respond, I appreciate it."
10jm5xf,"Thank you. Neurologist is on the cards, just searching for ones in the area."
10jm5xf,"get some Magnesium glycinate and D3+K. Is she hydrating enough? Our bodies don't produce Mg, they absorb it. And they don't test for it on ordinary panels.

The ""drunkeness"" sounds like my mom when she was in a T1D high or low."
10jm5xf,"Maybe go post this on other subs too. That's what I would do. Try, maybe r/migraine and maybe see if there's a sub for epilepsy too. There's so many types of both things. Not just the usual suspects.  It's worth a shot. Someone out there will know something. Good luck! I hope your mom feels better. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10jm5xf,"I agree it's selfish of her. 

The best advice I ever got was from a nurse: ""Don't care more about her health than she does."" (It's a traumatic story I won't burden you with. We don't know if my mom had Factitious Disorder or Schitzoaffective or it was just Narcissistic pretending, but it was bad.)

Let it go, for your own sake. 

(You've got my empathy.)"
10jm5xf,"I‚Äôm your moms age and I‚Äôve had these symptoms. Upping my estradiol to .07 has helped. I am hypothyroid, chronic migraines, IBS, heart murmur and dysautonomia (electrolytes imbalance) low blood sugar, low blood pressure. I have to stay very hydrated and stay healthier than most. I‚Äôm  basically on my on to figure it out as medical only knows how to add another Rx to the list. I stopped them all except Synthroid. I can feel like I water running through my veins vs minerals with the fatigue some days. Menopause makes it worse but I‚Äôm learning to balance it. I drink IV liquid packs, eat fruit, no dairy or gluten. I attempt to eat as clean as I can most days. High protein and low carbs. Yoga and or walking is a must or it seems the toxins build up. I‚Äôve been tweaking this most of my life. I‚Äôm just allergic to the modern world so I supplement and live a calmer life than most due to necessity. 

Our doctor told my daughter as she left for college  that she must take better care of herself than others. She‚Äôs taking this semester off to create a better routine for food prep and lifestyle. It matters. Genetics! Urgh!!! 

My mom has most of these except thyroid and she gave up on a medical diagnosis, also. It is extremely frustrating though when there‚Äôs not one answer and each doc wants to add another prescription or supplement. My mom eventually had a mini stroke while we were walking by continuing to push through when she should‚Äôve known to rest. She‚Äôs recovered but it took years. She has a mental block for self care."
10jm5xf,Good to hear. You‚Äôre welcome .
10jm5xf,"She takes 3000IU of vitamin D and has a K2 spray. She also has tried magnesium glycinate, magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide and they all give her stomach issues. The only other form I can think of that we haven't tried it magnesium l-theonate, but I've yet to find a good supplement in the UK. Thanks for the suggestion."
10jm5xf,"Thank you so much. It‚Äôs getting late in the UK, so I‚Äôm off to bed shortly. Thanks again for the help, hopefully me and my mum get an answer soon. üòä"
10jm5xf,"Yes, this is something few people understand -- that depending on the area of the brain that gets disrupted, an epileptic or migraine episode can look a variety of ways with weird sensations and symptoms. Not just the classic twitching epilepsy or migraine headache type."

10jm5xf,"Thanks so much for replying and I am so sorry that you are dealing with these symptoms, and I hope you and your family are taking care of yourself. If you don't mind me asking, how often/how severe were these stroke-like symptoms/alcohol-intoxication symptoms? Do you find you are able to manage your symptoms?"
10jm5xf,Blessings to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10jm5xf,"Hi, I go through this (not as intense though) with  aura migraine. Slurred speech, dizziness and impaired balance, fatigue and difficulty concentrating plus, indeed, the fear of appearing drunk. I had this since I was young and I believe there is a link to hormones. 

Do check the migraine sub for more.

Wish you and your mum the best."
10jm5xf,"Thank you. Yes, my symptoms improved recently with upping the HRT. I wish I had know so much of mine was HRT related. My labs tested fine until they didn‚Äôt of course. I take better care of myself now in stead of heeding my mom advice of that‚Äôs just how it is. Suck it up. I‚Äôm a medical nerd so research is my jam and I assist my family if they are not in denial."
10jm5xf,"The intoxicated stroke like effect came on quickly but was noticed as we joked about it so the estradiol was increased from .05-.07 and rectified. Nothing else has been changed that my husband and I can credit it to. If I think of something else, I will update. It can be  concerning with so many changes happening at once."
10jm5xf,"Thanks so much, I have a graduate science degree so I‚Äôve been trying to navigate my way through journal articles. I will get my mum to speak to her GP, who specialises in women‚Äôs health, and see if they can sort out HRT and I‚Äôll be searching for good neurologists in our area."
10roxcf,"‚ÄúMoon face‚Äù can be a sign of Cushing‚Äôs disease. 

If you haven‚Äôt had labs done in a while for thyroid and related disorders, ask for them."
10roxcf,"I have no idea what menopausal moon face is? Most women are losing fat in their face around this time. If you're actually gaining facial fat, is that really a bad thing?"
10roxcf,My face got thinner while my waist got fatter. This needs checking out.
10roxcf,"If you take any oral or inhaled steroids for asthma, copd, an autoimmune disease, or any other reason, contact your doctor asap."
10roxcf,Thought the same thing - am making an appointment with my doctor today.
10roxcf,Right. I don't think it is specifically a menopause thing. It can also come with steroid use.
10roxcf,What test should I ask for? I get thyroid panel annually since I‚Äôm hypo but wondering if I have the same since I cannot lose weight to save my life and my face is kinda round though I think it‚Äôs just fat and not another condition. Though I could be wrong
10roxcf,"Yep, I am over here looking like droopy dog while there is still plenty of fat on my body."
10roxcf,"My doctor (endocrinologist) ordered a blood cortisol test to check for Cushing‚Äôs.

I ended up getting diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and low ferritin, which can also contribute to weight gain. So ask also to check your iron and ferritin levels."
10roxcf,My endocrinologist used a blood cortisol test.
10roxcf,bless! we are so hard on ourselves!
10roxcf,Same!
10roxcf,I surely will!
10roxcf,What are you doing for your low ferritin? I have the same issue.
10roxcf,"I was somewhat upset by the options I was given. It was either- do nothing, or take supplements. I actually do like my endocrinologist in every other way except for how she handled this‚Ä¶ when I asked what kind of iron, she was like ‚Äúwhatever you try that you like‚Äù.  (Some people have IV infusions of iron offered, and at my lab levels I‚Äôm still shocked I didn‚Äôt get that offer.)

So I researched myself online and came across ‚Äúheme iron‚Äù being used for iron deficiency. I take those pills, and cook now with a cast-iron skillet (the latter sounds like it might be a ‚Äúwoo‚Äù idea, but there is a little research to support that it can add some iron into your diet).

The plan is to test again at one year and see how I‚Äôve done."
10eyt0a,"Hang in there, friend ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I don‚Äôt think this is the same as you but a whole bunch of early childhood trauma memories flooded my brain, body and soul when I hit peri, about 3 years ago. I understand your fear ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10eyt0a,‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
10eyt0a,I can relate.  Still trying to suss out what is trauma and what is menopause.  I wish you success with your therapy!
10eyt0a,"Yes. 

In addition, I had a traumatic childhood (ACE score of 7-8) and **then** in my twenties I was held hostage at work - which caused PTSD symptoms for years - **and then** another traumatic event happened 3 and a half years ago when I was in late perimenopause that brought back flashbacks of that previous trauma **and** also the trauma from my childhood. I'm now in therapy for C (complex) PTSD. 

The flashbacks and panic attacks were amped up 1000% when it happened in perimenopause. Plus they'd bring on hot flashes. HOURS of hot flashes and my heart racing. You can see how bad it was in my Fitbit heart rate data. My therapist called it ""anxiety cardio."" Literally looks like I ran a marathon. 

I didn't do therapy in my twenties (but I did do a lot of self-therapy techniques, including journaling). So even though it was milder (""just"" being unable to sleep thinking the men who had robbed my store and taken us hostage were breaking in to my house) it took longer to heal. 

The trauma in perimenopause (it's complicated but essentially my mother pretended to die in my arms to keep me from leaving, a lie which led to me finding out a lot of other lies, the most traumatic one being that she knew my little sister needed hearing aids as a kid and refused treatment) was accute and horrific, but comparatively has taken a lot less time to heal from. Maybe because I put so much into healing myself in my twenties? Maybe because my therapist is amazing? Probably both and more. 

It was brutal, though. That first month I thought I might need to commit myself bc I felt like I was dying (not that I wanted to hurt myself, but that my brain/ heart would explode - it was really intense). 

What helped was: writing it all down. Going for walks in nature. Extreme self-care. I cut out all alcohol and caffeine bc it made it worse. I had to wait a few months for my therapist and the attacks had already lessened significantly by then. (It was still awful and I'm still in therapy and I had a mild panic attack today and I'm ok. I'm ok.)

You'll get through this, too. I believe in you and I believe you're going to be ok."
10eyt0a,"You are going to be fine. I understand panic attacks of several varieties and have had them since my 20s. 

While in peri-menopause,  I had my daughter, lost both in-laws, my mother was diagnosed with 2 types of cancer, my best friend from high school lost her son in a car accident and my husband sued me for divorce.  His lawyers raked me over the coals, his PI had the cops bang on my door after I got home from a women's shelter and ripped her out of my arms, and threw me out of my own house.

Fortunately,  had a therapist and was already under treatment for depression. Despite 4 different gynos. I never got the hrt that might have made me feel better able to handle all of that. Just a crap load of drugs with wild side effects,  disappointing results, and wicked withdrawals.

I got through it. Ironically, I recently got a jury duty summons, and just going downtown brought up a lot of painful memories of going through the courts. It made me realize there were scars, but not raw trauma. 

Get all the support you can in every form available. You deserve it."
10eyt0a,Just a suggestion but you might be suffering from the effects of an absence of progesterone.  You won‚Äôt have a medical ‚Äòneed‚Äô for it as you don‚Äôt have a uterus however body identical progesterone has a calming and soothing effect and helps sleep.  It‚Äôs worth trying some of the body identical progesterone pills like Utrogestan to see if it helps and to see if you tolerate them.  These are not the same as the progestins that come in the patches that only keep the womb lining thin and don‚Äôt have the same calming neurological effects.  There‚Äôs been big changes in your biology plus some traumatic events and your body will need time to heal and adjust-  so as much rest and self care as you can possibly muster rn.  Sending hugs ü§ó
10eyt0a,"If you are taking oral estradiol, try splitting the pill and take it in the morning and then later in the day(5-7). I had a spell of panic attacks during a stressful time and the panic attacks were always in the evening. Once I started spitting the pill, the evening panic attacks stopped. Low estrogen made me extra anxious and I could tell when I forgot to take the second dose. I am older(57) and on the patch now. It takes awhile to get hormone replacement sorted out. I did eventually add 20 mg of Prozac(2years later) and it has really helped to tamp down anxiety levels. Some women don‚Äôt need an antidepressant in menopause but some of us do benefit from the right antidepressant. I would avoid those that are more difficult to withdraw from(Cymbalta/Effexor,etc). I was very hesitant to add an antidepressant but it has helped a lot."
10eyt0a,[deleted]
10eyt0a,"Surgical menopause is in itself traumatic, at least in my experience and I was older (49). And it also makes us less capable of handling life's stresses so it's no wonder you're struggling. I had to go through quite a bit of therapy from the trauma of having my organs removed (when they shouldn't have been).

1mg oral estradiol is a low dose for surgical menopause. You likely need double that. But It's typically best to increase slowly. You could try upping to 1.5 and see if that helps after a week or two and then increase more if needed. Some split their dose, taking half in the a.m. and the other half in the p.m. But generally your body will get used to one dose if you let it."
10eyt0a,"Kinda different‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ 

My menopause was due to my hysterectomy that I had for endometrial cancer.  I‚Äôm still in my 30s and having to make the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù to have a hysterectomy when I have wanted children for my entire life was traumatic.  Not only that, but having to deal with insurance issues because my oncologist didn‚Äôt have privileges at the hospital that was in network exacerbated it.  Consequently, I can relate in my own way.  I‚Äôm seeing a therapist to work through grief and trauma, plus meds and a psych referral.  Still waiting on that to come through but‚Ä¶ yeah."
10eyt0a,"Uhm how old are you OP? 1mg a day Estradiol is an extremely low dose for someone in premature menopause. 

Like it won‚Äòt get you anywhere close to the levels of the average 30 year old."
10eyt0a,"Hi, I only had the one ovary out and I was in bed with no energy or life for 3.5 years before I came across perimenopause, so my hormones were halved overnight and we don't know if my other ovary does much. I need a lot of HRT including testostorone to function. I am on 100mg patch (equiv to 2mg pill) and 1-2 pumps of oestrogen a day as top up."
10eyt0a,I listen to asmr videos..youtube has some delightful ones‚Ä¶warm baths too‚Ä¶they help calm.
10eyt0a,I knew I was going to need therapy after my surgery for the way I‚Äôve been treated by the medical field (accept for my last surgeon). I was told once things ‚Äúcalm‚Äù trauma can hit and unfortunately I had surgery and the tree all at once. Sucks really bad. Thank you for replying to me
10eyt0a,"I throughly enjoyed your response to me. I am so sorry you went through all that traumatic stuff!! I use to do therapy in my 20‚Äôs here and there and my 30‚Äôs a little bit. I think I just got annoyed of talking about the people who hurt me and how my first bullies were my family. The tree hitting and me thinking my mother was dead by it (she lives with me and I help take care of her), is what I feel what opened Pandora‚Äôs box. I‚Äôm going to bring up menopause Monday to my new PCP and therapist. They want me to try EMDR technique since this trauma I‚Äôm experiencing right now is very new. I am absolutely terrified of the medical field. The way they treated me like i was a drug addict trying to help manage a chronic pain disorder was RIDICULOUS! then when the endometriosis and adenomyosis pain started to really ramp up about 3-4 years ago I was gaslit, told to find a monk to breath my pain away, I was sitting at home more often so I had more to think about it, some people are just more susceptible to pain then others, after stitching me up from a laparoscopic surgery the surgeon woke me up off the OR table, etc. my last 2 surgeons who are partners were the absolute best to me! And oddly all the male drs were so empathetic towards me. Not the first Dr and her entire team. I still can‚Äôt wrap my mind around it. She sent me home so loopy and out of my mind I kept gasping for air. It was really horrible. I woke up about a week ago disoriented and gasping for air and that‚Äôs when the panic began. Like wtf I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and started to reach out to therapists I have a seen in  the past for all that Endo stuff and then that tree hits! I‚Äôm rambling but it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm also anxious too right now. üíú"
10eyt0a,I still can‚Äôt believe your mother did that! She‚Äôs not a good person to have done that to you and your sister. I‚Äôm so sorry about being held hostage. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine
10eyt0a,"Thank you for this. And I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. That‚Äôs one thing after another. My life use to be chaotic up until my early 20‚Äôs. I felt in my 30‚Äôs that I kept cheating death because of endometriosis and having ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, being gaslit but drs, and now the tree opening Pandora‚Äôs box. It was a lot of physical pain and suffering. I thought it was over and I could just do therapy and start the healing process. This all just flat out sucks. The panicked attacks and anxiety out of no where is really killing my back. Anything you recommend √ìthƒór then breathing and taking baths?"
10eyt0a,I take Zoloft. Before I got my ovaries taken out my breasts were so swollen and felt like knives were going through them. Now they feel fine. How do I know if my estrogen levels are too low? I do sometimes wake up so sweaty I have to change my clothes.
10eyt0a,Was it menopause? And did you get relief from it? I‚Äôm sorry you have cancer. Have you started treatment for that? That sounds really scary and heart breaking. I hope you have a wonderful support system. üíú
10eyt0a,I‚Äôll ask my gynecologist. I already sent them a message in the portal of my rambling like a moron. It feels good in the moment though word vomiting at the mouth. That‚Äôs why I came here. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through surgery like that
10eyt0a,I just turned 40. I‚Äôm in medical menopause because I had the hysterectomy.
10eyt0a,Endometriosis made me feel like I was whacked due to the gaslighting from the original drs I had that I was referred to from a friend. I have all of these appointments set up to see what‚Äôs going on. This panic fight or flight mode is absolutely awful. My chest and face burn sometimes it‚Äôs from a hot flash and sometimes it‚Äôs not ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am so glad I posted when I did and I appreciate each and every single person who responded to me!
10eyt0a,I listening to relaxing music. I try baths. I had a panic attack in the car this morning. It felt like the fight and flight feeling. I just wanted to get home. I took Xanax and I take Zoloft. I‚Äôm hoping therapy really helps me
10eyt0a,((Big hugs))
10eyt0a,"I also have medical trauma so I totally get it! It's important to find doctors who understand and empathize. 

(Though my therapist is younger than I am and doesn't understand menopause, she is empathetic and willing to learn about it.)

I have heard VERY good things about EMDR from fellow CPTSD survivors. I hope it will help you a lot!

(And yes, my mother was not a good person. She did so much more, it's an entire memoir! lol)"
10eyt0a,"Thank YOU! As far as back pain is concerned,  you might try yoga, aquarobics,  or a trainer who once taught me to relax my muscles while lying on one of those hard foam cylinders. She taught me some breath control while lying on it, the roll parallel to my spine. I swear, when got up, I felt 20 years younger. Now that I remember that, I gave to go dig that thing out and give it another go!"
10eyt0a,"Wait, back pain? Have you had your breathing checked? That sounds like asthma. (I have asthma and having an asthma attack during a panic attack does that to me.)"
10eyt0a,"Yea if you hadn‚Äôt naturally went into menopause, your blood estrogen levels are likely far too low for what your body needs with just 1mg a day.

Like you shouldn‚Äòt be kept at the 25-50pg/ml menopause HRT levels, but rather above 100pg/ml."
10eyt0a,"It is one of the most under-treated and serious illnesses that doesn't get the respect it requires from health professionals.  I knew things had never been right, but it took my first operation of a torted ovary through ER for the surgeon to see I was covered. I was 32 then. Two more emergency surgeries followed, then serious neglect that left another growth in me for so long it wrecked my body.
They will tell you not to take HRT, I would rather the endo return than the hell I was in stuck in that bed. It saved my life. I hope you get treatment, it's so hard to fight for ourselves when we are already down!"
10eyt0a,I dont have asthma. My back hurts from being so tense from the panic attacks. Im sorry you have asthma!! That doesn‚Äôt seem fun whatsoever!!! I hope you‚Äôre able to manage it successfully üíú
10eyt0a,The Dr said between 1-2mg my age is a good dose so we upped it to 1.5mg to see if that at least helps with the night sweats. I know my body and my mind is in total shock as well with all the new change we all just went through in my household. Thank you for your reply I truly appreciate it
10eyt0a,"I was just talking to the nurse and she said the shift is changing when it comes to endometriosis here. I‚Äôll believe it when I see it honestly. It‚Äôs always  ‚Äúit‚Äôs complex‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs too hard to diagnose‚Äù. They‚Äôre upping my estrodiol to see if that helps al√≠viate any of my symptoms. Definitely can‚Äôt wait for therapy Monday. 
I‚Äôm sorry you went through all that. It‚Äôs all traumatizing. The practitioners/drs are suppose to help us and listen and be empathetic but a lot think everything is in a text book and don‚Äôt think outside of the box. Fragile egos can‚Äôt simply say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Idk but here‚Äôs a referral I think who might help you‚Äù. Are you ok for now?"
10eyt0a,"Yeah I am stable now, although I think some is coming back as having serious urethral tube issues, but that could be that I need more vaginal oestrogen.

I've had all √≤ut wars with docs on wards who tried to dismiss me. I ended up with 4 surgeries in 5 years, it's took it's toll on me.  Wishing you wellness. Xxx"
111bb29,"I can't speak to the sudden occurrence of symptoms, but would suggest you get a thyroid check?  

Also even those with endo can take MHT/HRT. Once your body has been w/o estrogen for a while they have a chance to die off, and then a low reintroduction of estrogen can be successful.   Even a cancer scare isn't reason.  So definitely revisit this with your doctor (especially if symptoms are affecting your quality of life) and if they are not supportive, find another doctor.  

Also, I suggest getting a bone density scan, as bone loss is accelerated once we become post-menopausal."
111bb29,"Yes, I had the same thing happen to me a couple of years after surgical menopause (uterus and ovaries removed). I expected to have symptoms right away, but they were fairly mild and not disruptive. A few years later I got clobbered by severe symptoms‚Äîanxiety, palpitations, insomnia and night sweats. I learned from the hystersisters.com website that it isn‚Äôt unusual to have symptoms appear years after surgical menopause; some people said that it occurs when our bodies would have gone into natural menopause. But from my reading, it can occur any time; my doctor said the same thing (wish he would have warned me in advance!)."
111bb29,"If you‚Äôre in the USA, for folks who truly can‚Äôt take HRT, there‚Äôs that new hot flash med that coming down the pipe soon (from the company that did the super bowl menopause awareness ad). 

The wiki in the ‚Äúabout‚Äù section of this subreddit lists other treatments / supplements available.

There‚Äôs also info there about HRT + different cancers. FWIW, some cancers are not reactive with HRT."
111bb29,"Wow, you were lucky to have had 5 years with only mild symptoms. Mine were many and severe even though I was 49. Since you had / have endo, I suspect that any remaining endo was producing enough estrogen to keep symptoms at bay. But those implants may have died off by now hence the symptoms."
111bb29,"Interesting timing with this post. I am 10+ years out from surgical menopause but I too feel like now, at 52, am getting hammered with symptoms. I am planning on getting a full workup of blood and thyroid to see if anything comes up, but the theory that your body gets affected around the time of what your natural menopause might have been is interesting."
111bb29,Good luck

10zo9vs,"In a sense, this experiment has sort of been done by women who take birth control pills in their 30's and 40's. They don't see a decline in estrogen because the pill provides a steady high concentration for them every day/week/year/decade. Yet they still fall within normal levels of aging, and you'll only really see a difference in their bodies/skin/cells when they hit their peri years, when women who are not on the pill will on average have more symptoms than women taking the pill. If there was an anti-aging benefit to extra estrogen before peri starts, you'd see women on the pill having better health outcomes (or whatever your markers are for anti-aging) than women who are on non-estrogen based contraception. But in reality those differences only really start to show in peri. 

So while I'm not sure there is a clinical study looking at progressive estrogen supplementation in the form of HRT before peri, looking at the birth control pill outcomes suggests that maintaining estrogen levels really starts to matter in peri.

Having said that, I wish there were studies that look specifically at this, no reason why we shouldn't investigate the possibility of preventative health in women at all lifestages. 

And if you feel like declining estrogen levels in your skin are starting to show, they do make estriol based skin cream that has some clinical backing for it thickening some of the age-related thinning of skin. It wouldn't raise your body's estrogen levels, but would add a fairly safe form of estrogen to the facial skin, if you wanted to experiment with that."
10zo9vs,"No, there really isn't a reason to start before peri, and HRT is not prescribed for ""anti-aging,"" nor does it actually prevent it."
10zo9vs,"HRT doesn‚Äôt work the way you think it does. It‚Äôs used to treat specific symptoms and / or risks that increase in women during their 50s. 

If you are looking for an anti-aging  regime, ensure you exercise regularly (aerobic and weights), eat the recommended level of fruits and vegetables, eliminate or reduce alcohol, and wear sunscreen."
10zo9vs,"HRT is not some magic anti aging miracle.  And there‚Äôs no anti aging miracle.  Humans age.  It‚Äôs reality.  

HRT is wonderful for treating peri/menopausal symptoms.   That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for.  It‚Äôs got benefits like maintenance of bone density but it‚Äôs also got risks like any medication.   

We all need to take care of our health but seeking things for anti aging is a never ending merry go round of expensive false promises, dangerous injections and surgeries that usually lead to looking really weird eventually and then still aging.  Aging is life."
10zo9vs,"No I definitely wouldn't do that.  It adds risk for no reason, HRT has side effects (that most of us only put up with because we have bad symptoms, I'm tired of breast tenderness for instance).  It's a difficult balancing act even in peri.

And I doubt your estrogen is really decreasing much either, estrogen can actually \*INCREASE\* in the early parts of peri, but you aren't even in peri.  How it works is follicle cells produce estrogen, so as long as you have those you have estrogen.  When follicles start declining (peri and especially menopause) one loses estrogen because they aren't around to produce it anymore.  It's not that estrogen declines a bit every year, it's that estrogen falls off a cliff when we start running low on follicles (whatever age that is, normally 40s or 50s).  But if one still has normal periods they aren't declining yet.

If you are worried about wrinkles and the like use retina A/renoval or similar skin prescription (best if it's a prescription but even the over the counter stuff might work some).  If you are worried about health other stuff is what matters now, exercise (weight lifting especially, build all the bone you can now) nutrition."
10zo9vs,"I get the desire for a systemic approach to anti-aging, but unless you‚Äôre in peri then HRT won‚Äôt do what you probably want it to do.

Stay active, eat well, get LOTS of sleep, use sunscreen, cut down on the sugar and alcohol and nicotine, exfoliate, hydrate daily, moisturize, get your annual checkups with the various doctors (Gyno, primary, dermatologist for skin check), etc. 

If you want something to hold off on Botox, etc., I‚Äôve found that the Musely tretinoin (sp?) system is great! (You could also save money and just ask your dermatologist for the straight tretinoin too.)"
10zo9vs,"Like others I don‚Äôt think HRT is the right course of action for so many reasons, but if it‚Äôs something you want to dig into, there may be foods or supplements that can influence how the body produces or processes oestrogen and probably other hormones. I don‚Äôt know enough about it but I love what I call a therapeutic probe or experiment n of 1. 

Too much oestrogen sucks so you‚Äôll know pretty quickly if things are out of whack. I‚Äôm having a %#^* of a time trying to get my hormone levels right so honestly if you‚Äôre feeling good, don‚Äôt mess with the balance. Just enjoy it!

‚ÄúAnti-aging‚Äù scientist David Sinclair is an interesting listen especially if you love an Aussie accent! There are others but I can‚Äôt think of them. Bear in mind that the vast majority of research is based on men‚Äôs bodies."
10zo9vs,"I don‚Äôt think HRT is what you think it is. I‚Äôll be 51 next month and I don‚Äôt take estrogen yet because I have no symptoms and my estrogen is fine when tested. I do take 100mg of progesterone at night. I also did progesterone cream after ovulation until my periods in my 30s/40s due to pms migraines. It‚Äôs more symptom based then anything, not a fountain of youth. 

The best thing you can do is exercise, eat Whole Foods, get plenty of sleep, and focus on stress reduction from therapy, meditation, journaling, and changing your life as needed."
10zo9vs,What is the estriol skin cream you are talking about?
10zo9vs,All of this and I'd like to point out that progesterone cream is not effective for MHT.  P does not absorb through the skin. Any provider trying to sell you that is scamming you.
10zo9vs,+ sleep upside down like a bat
10zo9vs,"A lot of the online HRT telehealth clinics are offering prescription skincare products at the same time, often [estriol-based](https://www.myalloy.com/m4). But there are also a lot offered on Amazon, not sure what the source of the estriol is in those. Estriol is considered a relatively weak form of estrogen but it still has been shown to have a thickening effect on skin when applied (thickening in the good sense, combating the thinning of skin with age) - it seems to be more available than estradiol-based skin formulations, possibly because estriol is a weaker estrogen."
10zo9vs,"This is actually incorrect. And, here is some proof: [The Use of Progesterone Cream to Treat Dry Eye](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2382585). 

Personally, I was able to manage for several years using over the counter progesterone cream for sleep before needing to switch to a prescription, and if I forgot, I would end up being awake half the night. Just because it did not work for you does not mean it does not work.

Also, my dry eyes were in SEVERE condition and after finding that study I've been using it on my eyelids and the sandpaper feeling is now gone. I was in a tremendous amount of pain and was grateful to find that study because I never would have thought to try that! And it worked!"
10zo9vs,"Glad to hear your dry eye symptoms are now reduced. I had a gander at the study you linked, and it includes men, so I presume the use / treatment is not connected with menopause."
10zo9vs,"The amount used on eye lids would be safe for either men or women, but again, this is proof that progesterone can be absorbed through the skin or it would not work - and THAT was my point."
10zo9vs,"Sure, in empirical terms. But the dose, the proximity, and ability to manage the dose is always important in medicine. Your eyelids are among the thinnest skin on your body and is right beside the organ being treated. Progesterone in menopause is only given to folks with a uterus because the only reason it is mandatorily given to folks on estrogen therapy is to counteract the uterine cancer risk. You can use the progesterone pill vaginally, due to due similar aspect you describe with dry eyes / eye lids ‚Äî proximity."
10ng6yz,"It's your hormones. I have quiet borderline and I figured that my periods and hormonal shifts are the main triggers. I fixed it it with continuous birth control pills (skipping the placebos) and antidepressants. Never felt better in my life. I don't know what's waiting for me when I'll get older, though."
10ng6yz,Your hrt needs to be tweaked. You‚Äôll be ok üòò
10ng6yz,"I found your post while searching up menopause and bpd.  I am definitely having major severe issues with bpd now that I'm through menopause.  I'm trying to figure out if HRT helps or makes it worse.  I can't find any real data on it out there and doctors are kind of like uh... maybe, maybe not.  I don't know anymore but I'm having a rough rough time.  Good luck to you."
10ng6yz,Yep - no BPD but OCD/horrible anxiety - now add depression to the mix.  That's what happens in peri. THIS is a really great article on mental health and peri.  [https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/is-estrogen-the-key-to-understanding-womens-mental-health.html](https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/is-estrogen-the-key-to-understanding-womens-mental-health.html)
10ng6yz,"Already on the progesterone only pill (started some years ago as my periods were causing mood swings). I'm on 4 pumps daily of Oestrogel and 100mg of Utrogestan a night. Consultant at the menopause clinic said that because I am under 45 and the progesterone only pill isn't licenced for use as HRT in the UK, I have to take the Utrogestan as well to avoid the possible cancer risks from the extra oestrogen. Only been on it since September. Also on fluoxetine 60mg daily for the depression I've got alongside the BPD."
10ng6yz,"Same thing, can't work out exactly how the HRT is affecting my moods even though it's helping with the physical symptoms. I feel like I've gone back nearly 17 years to when I had the first breakdown, but because I was lucky enough to have DBT 15 years ago (holy crap, didn't realise that much time has gone) I have the skills to deal with it. 

Unfortunately since 2019 I've been treading water. Sister had a nervous breakdown in 2019, then Covid happened for nearly 3 years, then my mum broke her shoulder in 2021, dad has had cancer and a pacemaker in '21 and '22 respectively and my stepmother is currently in hospital with a botched gall bladder operation. 

And this is all aside from the daily stuff like 3 jobs, my benefits being constantly recalculated, cost of living crisis and perimenopausal symptoms which I've probably been experiencing for at least 2 years prior to starting HRT - not that I'd noticed because they had mostly been the same symptoms as my BPD/depression. Until the physical symptoms started and the anxiety became unbearable. Didn't help that the first doctor I saw said I was far too young for menopause. It took another 10 months to get a consultant to try the HRT option and diagnose primary ovarian insufficiency. I'm 40 next month.

There's been a lot of external stress with no break in between, and the hormones are tipping it all past my coping point. And I'm tired of trying to hold it all together because other people need me to be functioning. I feel like I'm in limbo all the time.

There's so little in the way of research into menopause and BPD, which means very little understanding from professionals. Which means I will be treading water for some time to come."
10ng6yz,"You may want to consult with your psychotherapist and up your antidepreassant's dose. When I was only on birth control pills, my depression was getting worse. Now I'm on 300 mg of fluvoxamine and I've managed to stabilize my mood with Yaz and Belara."
10ng6yz,"Man do I get it.  They need more research on all this.  I can't tell if its meds I take for various other crap, hormones or bpd.  I feel like a teenager all over again and not the good parts.  LOL  Take care, feel free to vent anytime.  I'm 52 and just finished my ""year without menses"" but I want to do HRT and no clue if it helps or hurts."
10ng6yz,"Not under the care of the mental health services, GP is in charge of prescribing the antidepressants. Therapy for the BPD was many years ago."
10ng6yz,"I think you should definitely consult with a psychotherapist since menopause hits harder BPD women, but also you should tell your HRT docs that you suffer from BPD and to tweak your doses, like the other user has just posted."
10ng6yz,"I'm going to make an appointment with the doctor, hopefully I can get one fairly soon."
10ng6yz,Do it ASAP. BPD sucks üôÅ. Please update us.
10rws45,"If you‚Äôre talking about Menopause Taylor, I agree. She has great info but her voice and presentation just don‚Äôt do it for me."
10rws45,"I‚Äôve been in menopause for over two years and still don‚Äôt really want to think about it. I‚Äôm only 42 so it makes me feel like I‚Äôm going to age faster than my peers, even though I know that is not true and my mind is just playing tricks on me."
10rws45,"I'm glad you asked this question. In particular, I'm glad you mentioned the ""A Vogel Talks Menopause"" channel because I looked at it and next thing I know, I've watched about 10 of her videos in a row! I find her information helpful, so, although I don't have any new information for you, I appreciate you sharing this resource! üòÅ"
10rws45,"I too would love to find someone who is scientifically informed, realistic, articulate and also involved in going through peri or menopause herself. 

I personally find myself avoiding Jen Gunter. She gets so involved in internet in-fighting that half of her feed sometimes is nothing but clap backs to trolls. Who has time for that? I get trying to correct public and popular medical misconceptions, but siphoning out random troll comments and posting them so she can give them a zinger response is... well, it's depressing. Why is she spending her time like that? 

Also she has this IMO erroneous take on scientific research. I'm a researcher myself. Just because a substantial clinical trial hasn't been done does NOT mean that something is bullshit, dangerous, or ineffective. It means **we don't have enough information for a scientifically directed opinion**. That goes in both directions. It isn't scientifically supported, but it's also not scientifically invalidated. We are at point zero. Neutrality. Jen Gunter somehow equates lack of clinical research with ""dangerous, doesn't work, bullshit"" - and that's not how science works. Surely she must know that. Funding doesn't *make* a medication or treatment work; funding creates the opportunity to *see if it works*. If there's no research, the answer is 'we just don't know yet'. 

And it sucks because otherwise she's a font of great information. I wish she would just stick to that part and ignore the squabbling and troll baiting. 

What we need is a female Avrum Bluming currently going through some stage of menopause. He's practical, a good communicator, cites research, gets appropriately outraged at the lack of research and medical misinformation, and then always reinforces the correct take-home message at the end."
10rws45,"Menopause Taylor constantly stresses to watch her videos **in order** and that's total bunk.  Her info (while informative) is repetitive and rambling so bouncing around is preferred.  You can adjust the video speed which helps make it more digestible.  Also the consults she offers are iffy.  

Check out Dr. Jen Gunter on Insta, she does (almost) daily a *Menopause Minute* rant/info session and provides update info on her Vajenda blog about the latest scam, etc.  She's good about calling out the bullshit and setting the record straight."

10dpix6,"I don't know what spammy link is, you attached but perhaps you can remove it.  

There is a lot of research about this (and it's listed in our Menopause Wiki as well), and most legitimate Menopause Societies agree....that:

**The risks outweigh the benefits when MHT/HRT is *started* after the age of 60 AND more than 10 years beyond your last period**"
10dpix6,"I started at 60 about 3 years post menopause. I needed it well before, but you know, doctors‚Ä¶Anyway helping me now!"
10dpix6,I started at 58 - 6 years after menopause.
10dpix6,"My mom is 70 and I demanded they let her try HRT. She had a Heart attack in her mid 50‚Äôs which I attribute to smoking and no hrt. 

She feels like a kid again and is coming off of the twenty prescriptions. Down five prescriptions working on getting her off all of them but three and hormones."
10dpix6,I resumed hrt at 60 after years of being off of it.
10dpix6,"This was one of the important findings of the massive HERS study from the turn of the century. The study famously found that there were all kinds of risks to using HRT and they discontinued the study for the PremPro group and a few years later for the Premarin-only group. There was a massive hue and cry across the land. Then further examination of the results found that the risk was basically there for women who started HRT after 60 or 10 years after menopause.  The study had preferentially recruited older women who had tended never to have used HRT nor had particular problems from menopause, and that turned out to be a flaw, since they unexpectedly found that there appears to be a window of opportunity when you can start HRT and receive numerous benefits, but if you start outside that window, the risks on average outweigh the potential benefits."
10dpix6,"I've posted a similar question here and on a different sub! I'm not a doctor, but there are medical studies showing that **combined** HRT can help post-menopausal women.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/10eevzl/hello\_im\_new\_here\_and\_i\_just\_posted\_this\_question/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3"
10dpix6,My mother is 76 and on estrogen. She and her Dr. weighed the pros and cons and it's changed her life :)
10dpix6,The recommendations are under age 60 or ten years after menopause
10dpix6,"From what I‚Äôve read, there is a 10 year window but it could be dependent on varying factors."
10dpix6,">under age 60 or ten years after menopause

Not ""or"", but AND"
10dpix6,My doc disagrees.
10s3nju,"No advice- but I also have Kaiser and am curious as well. I‚Äôve made and cancelled so many appointments so I haven‚Äôt been yet but I know I need to. I have a history of trauma with doctors (specifically obgyn üò´) so I am, for lack of a better term, scared shitless. Best of luck to you and I‚Äôll be following the comments!"
10s3nju,"You can see an OB/GYN without a referral at Kaiser, so I looked for a female OB/GYN with lots of good reviews, made an appointment, explained I was really suffering from hot flashes and wanted to try HRT. From what I've read/heard, this is the reason most are willing to let you try. And for me it was true, I was waking up multiple times a night due to them. I also had terrible anxiety but I didn't focus on that as much because I just think not enough doctors understand that is a symptom of menopause. She was willing to let me try with starting at the lowest dose and trying it for a couple of weeks. It didn't do much, so I wrote to her and let her know, so she increased the dosages. I've now been on the patch and progesterone pills for a few years. So not sure who you are seeing tomorrow, but if it's not an OB/GYN and they say no, try that route next. Good luck!"
10s3nju,I have Kaiser. I haven‚Äôt had any issues getting what I need. I guess I‚Äôm lucky or else it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm surgically menopausal so there‚Äôs no debate if I‚Äôm menopausal? I had trouble with my thyroid needs at Kaiser but I switched to a different endocrinologist that time and the other guy helped me.
10s3nju,I‚Äôm seeing my family practicing at Kaiser and it‚Äôs not going well.  Basically they are reluctant to prescribe unless your symptoms are bad -so stress how bad they are.  Especially hot glasses and night sweats.  Those are the symptoms they want to treat .  If you mention anxiety or anything else they will try to Rx anti depressants or anti anxiety drugs and recommend behavioral treatments like meditating. Good luck
10s3nju,I don't know if [navigating your medical appointment](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_navigating_your_medical_appointment) from our Wiki is helpful as I don't know what Kaiser is/does specifically.  But maybe it will provide some relevant info?
10s3nju,I‚Äôll do my best to update my experience. I might need a reminder because my memory has gone to shit in addition to all the other symptoms. ü§£
10s3nju,"Thank you so much. I‚Äôm actually seeing a nurse practitioner of the Ob/Gyn because it was their suggestion that i come in as soon as possible. 
I am going in with a list of symptoms: night sweats resulting in very poor sleep and several others major issues being only a few.
Your reply gives me hope!"
10s3nju,Kaiser is an HMO that encompasses all services into one system instead of a separate doctor and a separate pharmacist and a separate specialist and etc. It‚Äôs a slightly different process.
10s3nju,Oh! And I should add- my trauma was NOT through Kaiser. Hope that helps a tiny bit!
10ph7ra,"I was skipping some periods when I was 54 but still mostly regular. At 55 I did not miss a single period. I‚Äôll be 56 this year and still working like clockwork. 

I‚Äôm not on any hrt. My doctor does not seem concerned about this. She‚Äôs done a few tests and it seems that everything is still working like it‚Äôs supposed to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôm ready to be done with it."
10ph7ra,I am 51 and still bleeding every 28 days. Would the DNC be to check for something or just clear out your uterus?
10ph7ra,"I was 55-56 before periods skipped cycles.  If your doctor is concerned and/or the bleeding is painful and unusually heavy then maybe worth a check, but if periods are consistently average, then it's likely okay.

Edit: to clarify...were you getting periods the previous year while on MHT/HRT?"
10ph7ra,Your oven still works!
10ph7ra,I believe both
10ph7ra,Thanks for the reply l.  Trying not to get freaked out about it.  Yet your share is so helpful!
10ph7ra,"I've been regular 28 days till 50 then every 25 days and got on hrt at 52 1/2 and been regular since.  So my gyno is perplexed that I'm still regular even on Hrt
 Gng to finish the hrt at end of February and go see my dr to schedule a DNC and hoping it's just to clear out"
10ph7ra,"Angry old lady face, shaking her fist at the sky!"
10ph7ra,"MHT/HRT isn't meant to 'regulate' periods...it's simply topping up declining hormones, so if you're still having fairly regular periods at 54, then that's still within normal ranges.  The average age of reaching menopause (aka post-meno) is 51, but some folks it's later...like 55-57ish, and that's still normal. 

The only time MHT has a more significant effect on periods is when the progesterone is a higher dosage or if you have a Mirena IUD for the progesterone piece (progestin)."
10r26ja,"I could've written this. I'm early peri and I live in constant torment of finding a lump. My breasts literally terrify me. Showering is terrifying. I do breast checks a few times a day to the point my breasts hurt. This has been going on a few months. 

Growing up, breast cancer was my mother's greatest fear, even though we had zero family history of it. I think breast cancer awareness campaigns were and still are terrifying to women. I vividly remember her anxiety attacks when she was in her 40's. 

It realize this obviously had a a profound effect on me, but it doesn't make it any less terrifying. 

Ironically, my mother did end up getting breast cancer in her late 50's. Thankfully, she was diagnosed with stage 0 and only needed radiation. She's been in remission for nearly 20 years. She religiously went in for mammograms and found it a year after starting HRT. So her doctors strongly felt that was the cause. Because of that, I absolutely refuse to be on any BC or HRT. 

Running/cardio used to help but now the anxiety is getting the better of me. I'm going to seek therapy to try and get a handle on it. üò¢"
10r26ja,"I am having this also.  I tend to focus on my husband‚Äôs health instead of my own, but I can relate to the constant anxiety and scanning for symptoms.  I used to love reading articles about health and medical topics but had to quit looking at that stuff because it just added to my fears.  For me the anxiety over this really wasn‚Äôt there until the past few years in peri.  Sucks!"
10r26ja,Feeling this so much. I think it‚Äôs the randomness of all these symptoms as our hormones shift that is making me extra anxious. I‚Äôm trying to find a routine to track symptoms and do more preventive medicine without feeling besieged by what feels like a war in my body. I want to find some apps to help with the tracking and healthier habits.
10r26ja,"I am lucky in a way having had benign breast masses in the past (first lumpectomy at age 19) and am actually now having mammograms every 6 months to monitor a current mass.  I got used to the uncertainty and since everything has been benign so far I feel somewhat confident its all fine.  I instead focus on my husband‚Äôs health struggles, so the anxiety will find an outlet no matter what!  So tired!"
10r26ja,I agree the randomness and struggle with symptoms leads to anxiety.  I think also you can‚Äôt help but have some existential dread as you are confronting an aging body.  I too work at tracking and understanding and normalizing symptoms to establish a bit of agency to help me feel less groundless.  Good luck to you as you navigate this.
10ro51a,"This is absolutely me, my periods have always been irregular but the past year I know exactly when im due by the horrific night sweats for about a week leading up.

Doesn't matter what temperature the room is, what I wear to bed, what covers I have on. I wake up soaked and disgusting. Horrible"
10ro51a,"üòÇno you aren‚Äôt alone, how many are in the sub?"
10ro51a,"Defintely not alone.  I can't offer advice on how to stop them, but I have a couple of thick flannel sheets I double up and lay on top of my actual fitted sheet so when this happens at least I can just toss that one in the hamper and don't have to remake the whole bed.

Also, I never would have thought in a million years I'd be able to sleep without pajamas, but sometimes naked really helps."
10ro51a,"Yes I've tried cotton bedding, sheets instead of duvet. The bed has been stripped and aired all day because it was so wet. 
I'm wondering if it's the memory foam mattress that's keeping the heat in?"
10ro51a,"Well mine isn't memory foam so in my case I can say that's not an issue. It's so miserable waking up drenched at 3am, having to change,  and I'm always knackered."
10w4bfj,"Birth control doesn't stop or prevent menopause from happening, it simply masks some symptoms.  Perimenopause was happening you just weren't aware of the 'classic' symptoms.  

Generally doctors should offer MHT/HRT to those who stop birth control at that age, as this helps the transition into menopause, again by minimizing symptoms so you're not experiencing what you are right now."
10w4bfj,"This sounds exactly like my story, except I had Covid last July. I couldn‚Äôt kick the dizziness and brain fog and I started getting hot flashes, which I never experienced. I started HRT in October and my dizziness cleared up right away! That was my biggest issue. The hot flashes took awhile later and one increase of estrogen to stop. 

So to answer your question, hard to say but Covid absolutely exacerbated my symptoms. I was going to go to a primary care Dr to discuss my concerns but canceled and went to a Gyno instead to start HRT. Good luck!"
10w4bfj,The pill has hormones so you were effectively on hrt but they don‚Äôt call it that.   You need to go to the dr and try hrt.
10w4bfj,"You are still recovering from Covid, so it's hard to account for whether this is covid or menopause. I would recommend continuing to take it easy. The vertigo sounds more like Covid than menopause. It does matter which it is because treatment is different. I think now, though, you should assume it's both and go back on the birth control pill to reduce any menopause symptoms. That will help you to determine if the rest of the symptoms are covid. If it's Covid, then again, your best bet is to take it easy. With menopause, exercise is good. With Covid recovery, it's not: https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20220803/why-exercise-doesnt-help-people-with-long-covid"
10w4bfj,"I'm wondering if your symptoms are meno related or viral.  I'm currently being treated for vestibular neuritis which I got after having the flu, and it sounds like you're going through something similar.  I've been on estrogen for 8 mos or so, started abt 10 years after hysterectomy (still have ovaries) and no bcp because I didn't need it.  Meno symptoms completely stable"
10w4bfj,"I wish I had advice but this is all new to me as well. But wanted to add that I stopped the pill at 52 and did not have any menopause symptoms. My doctor feels the pill was masking any if I had them at all. 8 months later and I just had a monster period. 2 weeks of bleeding and now spotting. I just had a saline hysto procedure today and now need a D&C with ablation. This was out of nowhere. I really thought I was in menopause. 
It seems like every person is different. I wish there was a ‚Äútextbook‚Äù scenario but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be. 

Hopefully you are able get some answers soon."
10w4bfj,Should I make appt with ob/gyn then or primary doctor?
10w4bfj,Thank you!  I‚Äôm going to call mine today. I haven‚Äôt thought much of menopause until now because I‚Äôve never had symptoms!
10w4bfj,"Very good question.  I do to wonder about the Covid I had, since I have not felt the same since.  Vertigo started about a week ago.  Hot flashes started a couple of weeks ago.  So confused - I did make an appt. with Ob/gyn next week but I don't want to rush into the hormone thing which I haven't even had time to research yet."
10w4bfj,Oh my goodness I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through that. Lord I hope I don‚Äôt start having periods again!  My doctor told me that the pill could mask symptoms. I went ahead and made an appt for next week. I usually feel like I know what‚Äôs wrong with me but this vertigo issue is confusing me. It‚Äôs awful. Hope you get your issue worked out soon!
10w4bfj,Makes sense. If the vertigo is awful I'd recommend seeing your primary too.
10s1pke,"Blood tests can be suuuuper wonky during peri, and the results you get can differ widely by the day. So sometimes you might show up with ""post-meno"" levels because of the wild dips and swings of peri. I wouldn't worry too much about blood tests. They aren't that important. It's the symptoms that are key."
10s1pke,You can't be post-menopausal while still having periods..this is why hormonal bloodwork to diagnose menopause is not worthwhile.
10s1pke,"Yep. One iffy doc ran that test and told me I was totally in menopause. Then I got my period a week later. 

I reread the WIKI and the light bulb went on! The WIKI has sooo much info that every time I read it, I learn something new about my latest stage!"
10s1pke,"Blood test results can definitely be wonky and confusing. Even after my periods had stopped for over a year and I had my bloodwork done, the doc said, ‚ÄúYou are ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô in menopause.‚Äù I was upset‚Ä¶. you certainly don‚Äôt tell someone they are ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô pregnant - I wanted definite answers!! I switched docs and she looked at the same test results and said I was in menopause based on bloodwork and when my last period was. I thanked her for being the one to finally confirm.

The biggest giveaway was my FSH level being so sky high. My brain was trying very very hard to talk to my ovaries and my ovaries were saying, nope, not today, we‚Äôve checked out, lol."
10s1pke,Thank you for responding.  This is helpful.
10s1pke,Makes me wonder why the Dr ordered bloodwork. I'm still learning
10s1pke,Thank you
10s1pke,"Sure! Peri is a weird time. You could request another panel if you want, at another time, and see if there is a marked difference in your levels."
10s1pke,Because doctors don't know enough about menopause. Most know nothing at all.
10s1pke,Thank you
10l0tw9,Boooy that ep hits different this time around. Geez.
10l0tw9,Wow. This is great. Thanks for posting.
10l0tw9,Yup. This is why our generation has NO INFORMATION!! Thanks mom and grandmom!!ü§™
10l0tw9,I know right? Especially her mom saying she never went through it!
10l0tw9,Lol yes.
10n16tp,"Yes, but because the worsening coincided with the pandemic, I blamed it on pandemic stress for a couple of years. Since I‚Äôve been on HRT, it‚Äôs been a lot better. 

I was actually diagnosed with asthma as an adult, just a few weeks after I‚Äôd had a miscarriage. I really think there‚Äôs a connection between declining estrogen and asthma symptoms."
10n16tp,"Yes. So, I developed asthma as an older teen, and it was a ""thing"" for about 10-12 years, then it just faded away. I wasn't quite sure why, but several of my living situations no longer included carpet and I figured that was the reason why. Maybe my environment was bothering me less. Now in Perimenopause, my asthma came back. However, I'm also living in a home with carpet again, so I assumed that was the reason why - but, lately I've been thinking it's actually Peri because I am also dealing with severe dry eyes, and worse seasonal allergies than I've ever experienced in my life."
10n16tp,"It wouldn't be weird. Estrogen protects against inflammation, so when it declines, inflammatory processes run on more easily.

Don't let the inflammation run, though, get treatment. Steroids have some side effects but work. Anti-allergy medication, too. Clean up your environment."
10n16tp,I read this whole thing about histamines and your hormones. And also being allergic to my hormones. I ended up seeing a lot of connections. After I had my ovaries out I had way less asthma issues.
10n16tp,"Yes. I had severe allergies & asthma as a kid, better as a teen. No meds were needed as an adult, but I would take longer to get over an illness than most people. 

When I was fairly far into perimenopause, my allergies & asthma came back with a vengeance. I now have a nebulizer at home & one for travel. I need a few prednisone bursts each year in addition to my controller med, currently Breo Ellipta (ICS +LABA). 

In addition to hormones, minerals and vitamins can affect asthma. I pushed hard to get my Vitamin D levels tested, and found out I was deficient.

Even though there‚Äôs a family history of cancer, I‚Äôm considering HRT. Dr. Symptoms-last-a-max-of-2-years says I don‚Äôt need it. But, I figure if I can‚Äôt breathe, the rest doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I would recommend talking to you allergist or pulmonologist before deciding on HRT as there are some studies that show it raises asthma risks. There hasn‚Äôt been enough studies showing benefits or harms for there to be firm conclusions."
10n16tp,"I‚Äôm having dry throat issues with it too. It can come on suddenly and send me into a violent coughing fit. I have to carry lozenges and a glycerine based throat spray my ENT recommended, because I‚Äôve had embarrassing coughing spells in public (during covid times that‚Äôs extra fun üôÑ). If I can get to my throat supplies fast enough I can keep it from happening."
10n16tp,Thank you for all this info.
10n16tp,"I've been wondering if this stuff  (worsened allergies)  will continue once we are post-menopausal. I'm just experiencing so much insane weirdness... how much of the craziness sticks with us and becomes, ""oh, that's just old age""?"
110trst,The precursor to a patented pharmaceutical.  I need insurance coverage that does not exclude my hormone labs and an HRT doctor that can find their ass with both hands.
110trst,Look I'm just happy to see a MENTION. I've got an extremely unresponsive female dr.
11246bt,"I had an ablation that didn't work so was followed by a partial hysterectomy at 45 where I kept my ovaries.

I was still having a monthly cycle of ovulation usual PMS troubles etc for years.  I'm 55 now and it wasn't until the last few years I'm not ovulating monthly anymore.  My last was over this past summer.  

I was told because I kept my ovaries I'd go through natural menopause, just without the bleeding to track where I'm at.  Fortunately my ovulation has always been so obnoxious I could pretty much track that way."
11246bt,"Me. I had a few years where I had extreme pain while ovulating etc‚Ä¶ and then bam, hot flashes. All the time. Then anxiety‚Ä¶. So doctor gave me the common combo pills called Activilla I think‚Ä¶ anyway they didn‚Äôt help at all‚Ä¶ so I tried this pharmacy that compounds creams and such, that didn‚Äôt help‚Ä¶ so 2 years of having hot flashes so severe that I was waking up numerous times a night and getting zero sleep ‚Ä¶ my doctor gave me the Combipatch and I‚Äôm not having hot flashes, I got Paxil for my anxiety (I tried so many things before going to that) and for today, I am good. 

I‚Äôm so grateful I didn‚Äôt have to go through all the bleeding and irregularity.  The Ablation was a miracle and I got to save everything so no bladder issues etc so far."
11246bt,"I had ablation in my 30's, and now 46 and I have done so much digging and I also cannot find an answer.  I am fairly certain I am in peri and have been for many years.  Sometimes every 2 weeks my breasts blow up like balloons, then nothing for 2 months.  I've now gotten to the place where dryness is a massive issue, ( but yesterday I had discharge and later realized how damn irritable I was.  So I assume I am cycling.)  Some days are a hormonal roller coaster, I get hot flashes, some brain fog, and aching body.  All of these I assume are peri.  My watch takes my temp every morning, not sure how accurate it is, but  when I look at the last 6 months chart, I've only had one ""blip"", and since I have no period, and there is so little information out there for those of us who don't have a period, I'm going to go with it.  Long story short, I have allllll the symptoms, and if I go by my sister's age of hitting menopause,  I'm right on schedule."
111f4g7,"I see from your post history, you're in the UK?  If so, then they seem to be leading the way in recognizing menopause in the workforce.  There's been a lot of recent new pieces about this.

10snqj8,"Age differentiates between perimenopause and POI/POF.  If you are young, like between 20-35ish, then that's the general age range for POI/POF.  It's usually noticed by the absence of periods, not just irregular periods, but **not having a period**. 

Forty is a bit of a gray area for POI.  

Perimenopause is **irregular periods** plus a bunch of other symptoms which is commonly experienced between the ages of 40-50.  (Although it can occur in the late 30's too).  

Menopause is when you've gone 12 full months without a period, and this usually occurs between the ages of 45-60.  (Average age is 51)."
10snqj8,[deleted]
10snqj8,"So would you wait 12 months before starting HRT? I'm reluctant to take it:
1. Because what if my lack of menstruation is because of hypothalamic ammenorehea,
2. I stopped taking the combined oral contraceptive many years ago, when it was linked to my melasma and apparently hrt can also cause melasma.
3. My GP was so horrible to me and just brushed me aside telling me to take HRT and get on with it, when not him or the fertility clinic have checked my thyroid or estrogen levels.

Like before I agree to HRT I want to be sure it isnt something else."

10snqj8,"Thank you, my late mom did have a pituitary adenoma, which sadly meant she was at an increased risk of colon cancer. This too was something I wondered about for myself, although it's very rare that it's genetic.

I'm sorry that you were misdiagnosed. I feel like doctors just don't listen to people's instincts. Surely we're more in tune with our well being and bodies. 

I'm going to test my estrogen (no one has done that) and do one more FSH test (as per the guidelines, 4 to 6 weeks after the first one) and then based on those results make a decision.

All I want is to follow the recommended guidelines so that I can make an informed decision."
10kvvjg,"Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure you actually didnt do this lesson. Back in high school we had an English teacher who was going through a messy divorce - we would often tell her she did not assign homework that she definitely had, we would tell her we hadn‚Äôt done lessons that we had done because we wanted to push the test off‚Ä¶ we took complete advantage of her brain fog. 
Just saying, kids catch on to situations like this and turn it to their advantage real quick!"
10kvvjg,"I get that too when brain fog was really bad.  It‚Äôs funny how kids are, they know the moment something is up with me.  If I am tired they offer to help me, if I forgot something they remind me, etc.   Especially my 3rd and 2nd graders."
10kvvjg,Lol. I‚Äôm sorry. But they sound like good kids.
10kvvjg,"This is the first time it had happened, and one of the kids gave me a summary of the lesson, as it involved a real life scenario.  Only a few kids remembered it, so they got to read while I did the lesson with the rest of the class."

Now and then I have to argue with docs if they get a reading in the 70s because it's ""normal"", but it isn't at all normal for me.)

Again, it's not my opinion, just read any Menopause Society's mandate, or follow Dr. Jen Gunter."

There isn't anything in particular. I have just been concerned because of the drastic change in cycle length despite changing much in my lifestyle. I learned about premature ovarian failure and became concerned that maybe the reason why my cycle length increased was due to perimenopause."
10n47n2,"So your question resonated with me because I experienced weird and unexplained changes to my period at 30, and I too always wanted to be a mom and was afraid I had started perimenopause. I was also worried because my mom went through slightly premature menopause. I went on to conceive naturally as soon as I started trying at 35 and had a healthy baby at 36. I‚Äôm in my 40s now and my period is normal, although I find myself lurking on this subreddit because I expect menopause to be coming soon based on my mom‚Äôs experience.

So I‚Äôm not a doctor and can‚Äôt give a medical opinion. But based on what you shared, the changes to your period are probably not caused by perimenopause/menopause. Hopefully my own experience can provide you with some reassurance. I‚Äôd talk to your doc more about what may have caused the change in your cycle, but I don‚Äôt think you have to worry."

10oks19,"You could also try an anti-inflammatory diet, like the Mediterranean diet.

10oks19,"Good luck with finding your answers. I also was a fitness instructor for 30 yrs. Taught many different kinds of classes and loved it. My favorite was step aerobics on an 8 inch step with a bunch of jumps, jumping jacks, scissors etc. So I get it. But in my 40s I got sciatica that took me out for 3 years. I got going again then 6 years later I got severe pinched nerves that took out both legs till I could barely walk. I had to have a L4 L5 fusion and decompression of bone growth on where the nerves exit the spine) Here I am doing silver sneaker level workouts with pilates and stretching still feeling constant tingling in my legs and feet hoping I dont get long term neuropathy. So at some point which for me should have been a long time ago (Im 58 now), I should have listened to my body saying to slow it down and just be happy with fit and not ultra fit. I always heard during workshops that most back pain was from weak abls. Well I didnt have back pain, but that didnt stop my nerves from being compressed from bone growth from all that inflammation I had. No family history of back problems. So if old me could tell young me what might happen, I may not have listened but here it is anyway."

10n0sfr,"personally for me, I do a moderate 20-25 minute workout every day.  They usually involve some cardio, some strength and balance all in one.  I do a different workout every day and over the course of a week, I get a good dose of everything.  Because it's moderate, I don't suffer from pain/inflammation and there's no ""recovery"" day.  Again my personal fav is [Pahla B,](https://www.youtube.com/c/PahlaBowers/videos) a perimenpausal women who puts out free workout videos. 

The workouts are gentle (no jumping, no floor work) and you can go harder or lighter as needed.  Her messages make sense and are very motivational.  From someone who did ZERO exercise pre-meno, twenty minutes a day is doable and now I look forward to doing it every day.  

Another one I recently discovered, which is strictly weight training for women over 40, is [Life with Cee](https://www.youtube.com/@LiftWithCee/videos), another youtuber, who has changed her workouts to 20 minutes as well, so it's ""just enough"" without pushing too hard.

EDIT:  also if this helpful, from our Fitness Wiki, here's the required amount of exercise, so essentially 23 minutes of moderate exercise every day x7 days = 161/week, which is within the recommendation below:

**How much exercise do we need?**

According to a number of health resources (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The American Heart Association, and Department of Health and Human Services) adults need least 150 of moderate aerobic activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity every week, with the optimum goal of 300 minutes per week. This amounts to 21-42 minutes of moderate exercise, or 11-21 minutes of vigorous exercise every day, or approximately 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. Also incorporating moderate-to-high-intensity muscle strengthening (resistance/weights) at least 2 days per week.

Aerobic exercise is cardio (brisk walking, running, cycling, dancing, swimming, tennis)
Muscle strengthening includes lifting weights, using resistance bands, push-ups, planks, carrying/lifting heavy things

* Moderate intensity is easily defined by using the 'talk test', which means you can talk, but not sing while doing the activity.
* Vigorous intensity is when you cannot say more than a few words without pausing for a breath."
10n0sfr,"\- What sports provide strong cv workouts without requiring repetitive high-load muscle contraction 

I dont think that is possible. You have to contract large muscle groups of the body to raise the heartrate. But if you mean with stress on the joints and are low impact/hi intensity I have these suggestions. There is high intensity water aerobics. There are real water athletic shoes for it. Jumping jacks, scissor jumps, frog jumps. Water walking with blue jeans on. There is Pilates jump board workouts. No arms needed and no bodyweight impact. Both legs, single leg, side lying, all fours kicking the board away like a donkey kick. Also makes your abs strong because between jumps in supine when your legs have no support it comes from your core."
10n0sfr,"Absolutely not an expert and you‚Äôve probably explored these, but just in case‚Ä¶

HIIT - I believe gives the CV benefits without the sustained duration/stress.

Static cycling - e.g. spin. Less impact, don‚Äôt have to use arms and can get options that support the back.

Good luck x"
10n0sfr,"I can see this being great, especially if you're coming from a place of not having done any exercise before. 

If you've got a lifetime of sport behind you, though, and you're used to a 5k being a warmup, it doesn't feel like nearly enough -- it feels like (and is) deconditioning. So while technically we may be able to get by with less, that rapid, big-bump-down deconditioning thing is still what I'd like to avoid as far as possible."
10n0sfr,"Hi. Yeah, I don't know of anything that'd make it possible, but that's why I asked, maybe someone knows something I don't. Unfortunately impact isn't really the issue: it's the repetitive contraction yanking on tendon. It was always a problem eventually pre-menopause, but now I find the tendinitis and bursitis come on way faster. Which is not surprising given the pro-inflammatory force of dropping estrogen. It's why I thought, you know, maybe a daily low dose of ibuprofen? I really don't know."
10n0sfr,"Hi - yeah, unfortunately, chronic cycling, even without the push of spin, does in the quad tendons around the groin area after a while. Impact isn't the issue. Better the workout, the faster it happens. Used to be tolerable but now it's like one good workout and bam, I'm gonna pay for it. I think what I need to do is find a way to manage the lower bar to inflammation -- again, if that means a low dose of aspirin or ibuprofen or something regularly, that's fine so long as it's not taking apart internal organs along the way."
10n0sfr,"Yeah, I‚Äôve definitely heard not great stuff about long term use of ibuprofen. Hopefully there‚Äôs an alternative out there!"
10i4rtg,"I don't have any answers for you, but I hope you find what you need."
10i4rtg,"I'm so sorry you are in this predicament. What a crappy situation! I'm also in surgical meno but thankfully can take estrogen.  

One of the SERM drugs such as raloxifene may be an option. It is effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. According to [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960076013002847) there are also drugs that combine a SERM with an estrogenic drug to give you the bone benefits along with the symptom relief effects of estrogen. Of course, this combination with an estrogenic compound may not work in your situation. But since it's paired with a SERM maybe it wouldn't elicit the anaphylactic response?? 

Tibolone is used in Europe (Livial) and Canada (Tibelia) but not the U.S. It is used in postmenopausal women to relieve vasometer symptoms and prevent osteoporosis. So it may be similar to a combined SERM + estrogenic drug previously mentioned. But it is my understanding that it is oftentimes prescribed for those who cannot take estrogen. Even if you are in the US you may be able to get this from a Canadian pharmacy. I used to get thyroid meds from a Canadian pharmacy.

I hope you can find something that works for you."
10i4rtg,"I'm 44 in surgical menopause. I'm. Currently not on any hrt and at the moment, I don't want it.

I'm definitely stressed about the health effects of not taking it, but I don't feel good taking it. I actually feel better not having any. And while I'm concerned about not taking it, it makes no sense to me to take something that makes me feel worse. 

I plan on looking into alternatives to hrt. Currently I'm taking bone health vitamins. 


My thoughts go like this: if not having estrogen could increase my risk of heart disease or cholesterol issues by a percentage, so I take estrogen to decrease that, but then going on estrogen makes me gain weight,which put me in a bad BMI, and gives me more anxiety, and increases midsection weight, didn't I just raise my percentage of risk of heart disease? For me it just feels like a wash."
10fdpmq,"Everything WILL be okay. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will.

I went through chemotherapy-induced menopause at age 46 (possibly 43; I stayed on oral contraceptives until I threw a clot, which resulted in a pulmonary embolism, and was taken off, so I'll never really know the exact age for sure). One of the first things my oncologist told me is that my fertility would most likely go bye-bye; I never wanted children, but the minute I realized that the choice to not have them was taken away, I was pretty upset (and then I asked myself why I was upset when I didn't want them in the first place!!!).

Because of the pulmonary embolism, I was told that I couldn't do HRT (which I'm now finding out might not be correct info, but at 10+ years out, it is what it is).  I've been very fortunate; I haven't had symptoms that I would consider terribly bothersome, while other women have. Some of my issues COULD be menopause related, or they could be late-term effects of some of the neurotoxic chemo I had (""chemo brain"", neuropathy in my hands and feet). Since I had a bone marrow transplant, I'm followed very closely and so far, no cardiac issues or bone density changes. 

And that libido? Aww, shucks. My partner and I have been humping like dizzy bunnies.

You aren't being dramatic at all. We all think we're invincible until one day, we find out we aren't. Your feelings are completely valid. 

Hugs to you."
10fdpmq,"You'll just have to talk with your oncologist. I had a borderline tumor (though was removed by my endo surgeon, she was trying to save my ovary and did a great job for nothing) and I did have the option to keep my ovaries, but on monitoring... but a much better outcome to get more biopsy and remove ovaries, it was more or less if I had the money for surgery to just get it done.

But it is always case by case basis and a good oncologist knows the score. They would have to figure your risk vs long term health as they don't remove that last ovary unless they have to as you need those hormones. You can always get a 2nd opinion. Borderline tumors are slow, mine was growing for over 4 years as other gaslighting shitty gyns ignored it thinking it was a regular cyst.  But same time, you don't want it to spread and or the chance it becomes worse.

It isn't completely end of the world for sex. It isn't 100% the same, but Testosterone helped me loads to be almost normal. HRT/ Estrogen helps me function without surgical menopause and testosterone takes care of energy and libido. My life is even better than before as I'm not in pain from all that.

It is scary and crazy, but all gets better once you know more information and odds. As always, you can find another doctor if you are not satisfied. You pay them."
10fdpmq,"i feel the exact way about the kids thing. i‚Äôve never had that desire for them so oh well, my parents will probably be more upset about that part than i am.

with my first tumor, the fist doctor i went to said it was just a regular cyst that would go away on its own. which was so crazy for me to comprehend because i was literally in the worst pain of my life i could barely move. then got a second opinion where they said ‚Äúno this is a tumor & needs to come out asap.‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me how some doctors can be so wrong and dismissive. i mean maybe it was a plain mistake but i‚Äôve seen this same story happen to countless of women.

10tp1zj,"I read the article.  Not too bad, at least it does say that estrogen replacement is safe and effective for most women.  It just keeps saying a woman should talk to her healthcare provider, but it doesn't mention the fact that most of them will not really be helpful (as WE know) and the profession needs a serious upgrade in it's understanding and response to helping women in menopause.  I wish it would have advised women who get blown off by their doctors to keep at it until they find someone who will listen.

They finally did mention testosterone at the end, but only mentioned one of it's benefits, libido (of course!) and said it's hard to get and difficult to dose properly.  So that's going to discourage women who read or listen to this article from asking for T, and that is yet another continuation of inadequate advice for women who are looking for relief.  

That's my take on it, anyway."
10umhxp,"I've been told by my GP that family history isn't important, however on my dad's side of the family there are very few women compared to men and we all suffer the same absurd hormone issues. I don't believe genetics isn't playing a part. 

My grandfather had 1 sister who never conceived, was menopausal in her early 30s and had a hysterectomy aged 35.

My dad has one sister who needed a hysterectomy aged 32. 

My dad is 1 of 8 boys, accross those 8 boys they have produced 24 grandsons and 6 grandaughters. 

Out of 6 grandaughters (myself included) 5 have been diagnosed with pcos. 2 of us have had hysterectomys before the age of 40. I believe at least 3 of us have PMDD (only I am diagnosed, along with endo and due an oophrectomy in April). Only 1 of the 6 has had children and that required IVF. 

I may not have a medical degree, but I refuse to believe that's not a hereditary issue. It worrying because I now have 1 biological niece aged 12 who is already experiencing the problematic periods I experienced in my teens. 

You know your body better than anybody, don't let a doctor tell you you are wrong about your hunches without proper examination and investigation. 

(Side note; I once saw a psychic who, amongst other things, told me I was carrying the generational trauma of a woman who was cut open at her womb and died in an asylum. Digging around on ancestry.com it turned out I did indeed have an ancestor who died in an asylum, although no further details are available.)"

‚ÄúWhat Fresh Hell..‚Äù is just humorous enough to have the underlying truths hit home (as opposed to something more clinical and dry). It really gives depth to the realities of Peri/Menopause. 

‚ÄúCome As You Are‚Äù should simply be required reading for every human at any (post-adolescent) age. But especially if your husband is struggling with your changes (and perhaps changes in libido) the perspective on ‚Äúcontext‚Äù and all of the things that happen in Peri/Menopause that ‚Äúhit the brakes‚Äù on libido is quite illuminating. 
And it can be re-assuring that it‚Äôs not so much that your partner doesn‚Äôt have interest in you anymore so much as 1) just not having any interest at all, 2) having interest but being completely uncomfortable in a new/changing body and/or 3) being overwhelmed by so many other issues that they just can‚Äôt get to ‚Äúsexy‚Äù context. 

However nothing (NOTHING) is as instructive as checking this sub daily and being reminded about all of the Hells each and every one of you are facing all the time."

10odn24,"Many opt for the Mirena IUD as the 'progesterone'/progestin piece of MHT/HRT.  The other piece of MHT is estrogen, so they will add on an estrogen patch to help with symptoms.  This combo seems to work well for many, as the progestin provide superior uterine protection (it delivers the hormone directly to where it needs to be), while the estrogen helps eliminate symptoms."
10eg2dk,"It‚Äôs highly unlikely that your blood / lab work will tell you anything about your hormones, unless your FSH levels are above a certain number that I cannot recall, which is indicative of being menopausal. It will likely NOT tell you you have exceptionally low estrogen or progesterone, because even a 25 or 30 year old woman can show that, depending on the day in her cycle. 

It‚Äôs just what hormones do. Unfortunately.

That said: one of the hacks that is available to us is to take our basal body temperature, a la natural family planning method. It‚Äôs very specific + kinda high maintenance though, so I haven‚Äôt tried that yet, post hysterectomy [I did use it for both birth control + trying to conceive a decade-plus ago].

Next up: Those ovulation test kits or strip thingys that you pee on. Which I‚Äôve also not used, since I think I have a fairly decent pulse on my cycle, even with a radical hysterectomy. But it can be done‚Äîand, at least let you know if and when you‚Äôre ovulating, to help you try to shake out where you might be in your cycle. 

In the meantime: I track everything else on a period app [mostly for mood, energy + sleep purposes] so I can have an idea of where I might be at and why I always feel crummier / crazier / unhinged in that ‚ÄúPMS week‚Äù zone. Which is definitely shifting some, but still staying somewhat regular. 

If anyone has other suggestions out there, I‚Äôd love to know! ‚ÄòTis the blessing + the curse of no bleeding.

PS: I‚Äôm 42, almost 43, and have been having hormonal wonky-ness for a year or so. Regular acupuncture, plus some ancient Chinese herbs she also prescribes, seem to have also helped level me out ‚Ä¶ For now."

10xgkny,This feels like an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls‚Äù statement wrapped up in pseudo-feminism.
10xgkny,"She's one of those ""Oh, I never really had a problem"" women ü§®"
10xgkny,It sounds like internalized misogyny has her by the neck...hope t starts to squeeze.
10xgkny,I am tempted to post the first two paragraphs of this editorial in r/thathappened
10xgkny,"i'm going to grammar shame, because this is a person holding herself out to be some sort of authority on something...

""myself and another woman assured her...""  wtf is that ungrammatical nonsense?"
10xgkny,"Comparing our experience to that of men our age?
Oh, and by all means, let‚Äôs shame women into being quiet because the status quo might not let us into the boardroom. Maybe the problem is not menopausal women sharing their truth, but rather a male-dominated culture that makes entry into high-level corporate roles difficult.
Bang the drum for older women whose children are grown? Very narrow. Why not bang the drum for all women? How about considering those menopausal women who had children in their‚Ä¶say, mid-thirties‚Ä¶and still have plenty to offer while caring for their families, often as single mothers. Let‚Äôs consider that not all women crave boardroom roles. ‚ÄúDeficiencies‚Äù?? 
I will bang my drum for the women kicking ass everyday, despite challenging symptoms, in whatever role they choose or find themselves."
10xgkny,"Wow not only did she make us out to be sex starved animals, but she mentioned bc we are OLDER.  There are a lot of debilitating symptoms with menopause and yet she tries to compare them with a mans loss of virility. What a schmuck."
10xgkny,"It's 4am, I am awake because an hour ago I woke up having a panic attack which I didn't know was a thing until I became peri-menopausal. I was also awake at 12.30pm changing my pajamas and sleeping on a towel because I woke up soaked through. I have a funeral to go to today which I will have to take beta blockers and vape lots of cannabis for because the idea of being out, around people is filling me with such anxiety that I have spent the last 3 days wishing I would break a leg and couldn't go and I still get excruciating cramps when I should be due on so that's not helping. And to top it off I have ADHD which has been greatly exaggerated by the peri menopause üòî I'm so glad there are women who don't have such a terrible experience whether that be great genetics, incredible healthcare etc I don't know but I hate it and I am struggling but it's not because I'm just not coping well enough which is what that article reads like, it's because for some women, it's debilitating and to suggest otherwise is what is doing women a disservice."
10xgkny,"Thanks for less than nothing ALEXANDRA!!!
My husband is 80 and has not lost one OUNCE of male vitality. I'm 64 and out of fucks to give! You have sent us BACKWARDS with your misogynistic elitist old attitude!

I hope she gets a whif of this subreddit."
10xgkny,And what‚Äôs with the dumb shoes? I don‚Äôt understand how she can walk in them and I don‚Äôt trust anyone who can.
10xgkny,Some women never age out of the ‚ÄúNot like other women‚Äù and ‚Äúpick me‚Äù demographic.
10xgkny,And she can fuck off! Asshole.
10xgkny,"‚Äúendless talk‚Äù?! There has been _no_ talk and I was blindsided. I had to ‚Äúkick up a fuss‚Äù to get medical care. Took me two years and it was the last effort I was _able_ to make that finally got me the help I needed. What would have happened to me after that? 

If there were adequate awareness and education, adequately educated doctors, and affordable, readily available medical care this article couldn‚Äôt be written. Instead of using her platform to call for these things, she threw us under a bus. 

Special place in hell."
10xgkny,Internalized mysoginy is a very ugly trait.
10xgkny,"My peri was absolute hell. I developed severe anxiety which eventually became OCD (constant, distressing ruminating thoughts). Wild mood swings. Weepiness. Rage. Inability to focus. Not to even mention the hair loss, insomnia, etc etc. For over 3 years I struggled with this shit. Supplements, meditation, CBD oil. Nothing was more than a bandaid over a gaping wound.

I started HRT at the start of the year and all of the emotional symptoms are now gone. I feel like myself again. The relief is indescribable.

Fuck this woman. To minimize the experience that some women have because she didn't have it is beyond ignorant. It's smug, arrogant and damaging."
10xgkny,"How about we don't normalise feeling terrible all the time? It doesn't matter how old you are, if you're male, female or non binary, you shouldn't be forced to cover up your discomfort or distress to keep up in the workplace.

The last thing anybody needs is another journalist saying ""don't speak up, it makes you look weak""."
10xgkny,I‚Äôm not interested to hear anything from someone wearing such stupid shoes.
10xgkny,I‚Äôd like to slap her silly
10xgkny,"By talking about menopause, we could create new doubt in our employers minds? Implicitly saying that employers are men who shouldn't be inconvenienced by us meer, menopausal women. Also inferring that there is no room at the top for women and menopausal women themselves can never be employers (probs because of their menopausal disability that only exists because some women are bleating on about it).

This is an inaccurate, lazy and wholly revolting piece of writing.

I've also posted this comment on her Instagram."
10xgkny,"Love the little tossed bone about how some women may experience menopause more intensely than others. It's clear it's been a picnic enough for her to inspire internalized misogyny. Meanwhile, I was up once again at 2:26, drenched in sweat, with the middle of the night dreads, and I am still constipated after four days. My boobs are staring at the floor all the time these days and I've got new deposits of fat around my bra line despite my regimen of targeted exercises.  I have to psych myself up for the things I do automatically, like food shopping and cooking dinner, mopping the floor, and even taking out the garbage, because I am so tired and achy.  I do take a thyroid supplement, which helps, but everything else is a one day at a time proposition. Some days are better than others. Today is bad. And according to Shulman, I should just shut up about it because the Tate gallery has no women painters. What?"
10xgkny,"So in her oh-so-feminist (heavy sarkasm) column, she perpetuates the stereotype it's a woman's job to care for children... yeah no, complete fail, lady"
10xgkny,"Looks like the Daily Mail, which explains a lot‚Ä¶"
10xgkny,"No, no, no!! WTF?!? Things like this set women back years! You can be assured that if this was happening to men it would be acceptable for days off, openly sharing symptoms and lots of empathising/sympathy. But women have to be silent in their struggle?!? Fuck. Right. Off. üò°

Set me off on my worst day. Just see what happens. I. Dare. You ü´£"
10xgkny,"Such an illuminating article. She wants women just to shut the fuck up about debilitating menopausal effects because some women (such as her) are either unaffected or less affected.  So don't ruin the prospects for the fortunate ones. They don't want to be confused with those pathetic women who are unable to cope with a natural life process. 

I've worked with women like this before. Yes, I will lump them into the same category; competitive nature, low emotional intelligence, unpleasant personality, intolerant."
10xgkny,No words.
10xgkny,We want info and resources. Not sure why she‚Äôs freaked out
10xgkny,"Should we then not speak about the realities of heart disease in women, because ‚Äúnot everyone deals with it‚Äù and we‚Äôll just be frightening young women coming up? Don‚Äôt discuss what to look out for, ways to prepare, where to look for treatment if the need arises? Because men have stoically and bravely died from THEIR heart disease throughout history and we don‚Äôt want to look weak compared to them, right? 

This is stupid."
10xgkny,I‚Äôm handing out upvotes like Oprah here.
10xgkny,I can‚Äôt get past ‚Äú49 year old‚Äù and ‚Äúwailed‚Äù. Bitch please. Gen X doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwail‚Äù. We rage and burn the fucker down. üòè
10xgkny,If she's lucky enough to have mild symptoms she should just shut up. What a narcissist.
10xgkny,"This fucking biatch drones on later in this article about the lady boner she has for books of matches, about how she‚Äôs launching a one woman campaign to delay the extinction of postcard use, and about how she can‚Äôt bring herself to throw away old letters that no one but her gives a shit about. Fuck her narcissistic, shallow noise. She should just shut the fuck up until she has something worthwhile to contribute to the world."
10xgkny,"This whole article is a mess. There‚Äôs no coherency or basis to ANY comparisons. 

1) Age isn‚Äôt a true determinant of menopause ‚Äî if it were, all female fetuses would biologically have to be born with the exact same amount of eggs‚Ä¶ that all die at the exact same time. Freaky. There could be no premature ovarian failure, PCOS or endometriosis (which she probably thinks aren‚Äôt real issues)Also, factor in shitty food preservatives, smoggy air and Rx-filled water that contribute to poor reproductive health. 

2) No researcher would conduct a comparison study with one body comprised of estrogen, progesterone & testosterone, to one body with testosterone. You can‚Äôt even accurately test or theorize a hypothesis. 
So male v female (age, hormones, et al this shit) is futile. 

3) The shelf-life of male sexual vitality is covered by insurance in the form of viagra. Meanwhile pregnancy is STILL a predisposition for insurance & discriminate in the workplace; Childcare is unaffordable, and abortion is illegal. So where is the big win, the one that ‚Äúwe‚Äôve come so far‚Äù with - women can wear pants to work now? 

I‚Äôm 45, in menopause, mom of twin 5-yr-olds, and I work.

10xgkny,THE MENOPAUSE
10xgkny,I‚Äôm just over here laughing every time I read ‚Äúthe menopause‚Äù.  üòÇ
10xgkny,"none of us are exactly alike and some of us experience things differently.  I am on about 4 different sub reddits and sometimes when I read them, I completely understand because I have that.  On others, my symptoms don't seem as bad, but does that mean I assume their pain isn't genuine, no, it means I offer sympathy.  What I'm learning in all this is that we as woman have to stand up in unity for these things no one talks about because we are supposed to cross our legs and shut our mouths."
10xgkny,‚ÄúKicking up a fuss‚Äù - those silly silly gals
10xgkny,"Yeah this has that foul ‚Äúableist‚Äù odor about it.

I can be pretty bitchy about anyone who constantly grumbles and complains about every last thing, but I know damned well to keep my opinions to myself.

Some (people assigned female at birth) absolutely sail through the time when their bodies are no longer producing estrogen (or if this happens via surgery.

Others are not so lucky.  I felt like I was losing my goddamned mind. It also sent my ADHD symptoms into an entirely new level of dysfunction.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that my stress and anxiety kicked up to 11 was what caused me to get Shingles a few months after I turned 50.

I honestly don‚Äôt know how I was able to keep myself together.

This woman would find a more receptive audience if she understood how bad the physical and psychological symptoms can be for those without a formal diagnosis and symptom treatment /management protocol. 

It‚Äôs not just an inconvenience.  I‚Äôm 56 years old and at probably the high point in my career. I‚Äôm not sure how well I‚Äôd be doing right now without my MHT."
10xgkny,"Instagram is NOT letting her off the hook for this one. The comments pretty much tell her she's delusional, and she doubles down by saying her article is about the Equalities Act.

Whatever, Alexandra."
10xgkny,Oh fuck off Andrea.
10xgkny,"I agree and disagree. Clearly, the first two paragraphs should come with a trigger warning that you will throw up. But I think she‚Äôs right to say that ‚Äúthe last thing we need is a climate of uncertainty around whether older women are healthy enough to do their jobs.‚Äù

What needs to change is corporate culture. Everyone should have the right to a personal life and time off to care for themselves or their families, whatever that looks like to them. But in the current climate it‚Äôs frowned upon to not work 24/7/365, at all hours, to the point beyond burnout and women especially are victims since we often have more reason than men to require this time.

But specifically asking for protection for a woman‚Äôs natural functioning? No. Being a woman should not be considered a ‚Äúdisability.‚Äù That demeans us all."
10xgkny,What a heartless cow.
10xgkny,Pick me girl
10xgkny,"It‚Äôs amazing to me how many women take on the same hatred of other women that they witnessed their  fathers, brothers, boyfriends, male friends live with. God forbid women open their mouth about their suffering. She can take those minuscule heels and flop right off. Asshole"
10xgkny,"May I have your attention please?
  
*AHEM*
  
Just because your experience wasn‚Äôt that bad, doesn‚Äôt mean that is the experience everyone else had, or is likely to have. 
  
We all get our own journey. Some have easier times, some have extremely difficult and challenging times. Everyone deserves to be heard and considered in these discussions. 
  
My own mother said menopause wasn‚Äôt too bad for her, I‚Äôm only 40 and hitting the night sweats, brain fog and I‚Äôm expecting a bit of a rougher go than it sounds like she had."
10xgkny,Yet no ‚Äúthe‚Äù before ‚Äúhospital!‚Äù Haha
10xgkny,"Wow. I just have so many responses to this in my mind the unpacking of it is giving me tachycardia. Whoops! I shouldn‚Äôt say that, even though it‚Äôs right in line of being passive aggressive but silent. I just keeping thinking men don‚Äôt complain because they literally trade in the old pseudo mother model for a new pseudo mother because the original one doesn‚Äôt have fucks left. The actual self loathing this woman must have and the hate for her own sex. Blows. My. Mind. I‚Äôm not going to shut up or stop talking because  this Phyllis Schlafy wanna be wants to bitch because women are actually discussing the issues of life."
10xgkny,Ableist garbage.
10xgkny,"It‚Äôs ok, she can have a heart attack at 52 and be diagnosed with diabetes too. Then when the ignorant doctor says ‚Äúwell you just need to eat right and exercise‚Äù, then Maybe she‚Äôll change her tune."
10xgkny,"What's this about different people having different symptoms and intensity when experiencing the same health condition and maybe disability being determined on a case-by-case basis instead of a blanket rule? That's just crazy talk. My uncle had prostate cancer and he just had an operation and now he's fine. That's proof that men who think they had to have extensive treatment and/or died from it are just hysterical, lying for attention, or lazy and don't want to work. 

(Yes, I am fluent in sarcasm. And as an aside, I didn't believe and have sympathy for women with much greater menstrual discomfort than myself in order to win the same for myself when perimenopause kicked my ass a few decades later. But it sure would be nice to get some of the same belief and sympathy I gave those women now that it is.)"
10xgkny,"That was a lot of words to basically say men suffer through their mid-life crisis and don't complain, so we shouldn't either. We should try to be as man-like as possible to ""earn"" these positions. There are so many reasons this thinking is wrong that I will not begin to list them. However, I will say that if men are suffering in their middle age, the way women do going through menopause, then they absolutely should have protection from job loss if they need extended time off. This would reduce the burnout of highly trained and experienced employees. This benefits everyone. The same reason we need protected maternity and paternity leave."
10xgkny,"In my experience, it's not that it's such a ""grim experience that needs protection"" but it's a medical condition that's not given the attention or study that it deserves. I'm all for having menopause considered a disability if it gives doctors and the FDA the ability to make insurance pay for HRT, approval for new drugs, more study on the effects of hormones, for employers to accommodate my hot flashes and my new need for more personal time off work to deal with my new medical condition and my increased doctor's visits."
10xgkny,What an asshat.
10xgkny,"RRRRRIIIIIGHTTTT.!!! I'm off, I'll be back in a minute.




'ehhhemmm......not all men...'"
10xgkny,"I watched as women were let go/fired from the office I worked at because they were being difficult, abrasive or had a short fuse.  They were all between 45 and 60 years old.  I was younger and ill informed on what they were going through.  They were absolutely targeted for having menopausal symptoms, I have no doubt about it.  I didn't find any of their behaviors bad enough to warrant dismissal but some of the middle aged men that ran the office certainly did!

There needs to be more discussion about this at the workplace level.  No one should be fired for being menopausal!!"
10xgkny,"As a 29yo woman who's on this forum to help my 52 yo mom, this pisses me off. We are dealing with ever changing, life altering symptoms over here and it's this sh!t (the article) that's perpetuated this all (menopause) being so sudden and unexpected. I feel like I have started counting down my days before this rollercoaster of a hard phase to hit and I'm completely alone besides this forum!"
10xgkny,"""Myself and another woman assured her....""

I sure hope this author isn't a professional writer."
10xgkny,I think the bigger issue is dealing with the fact that as you age you start to deteriorate. Living is painful and where is the line that defines what pain or deteriorations grant you allowances such as disability?
10xgkny,Nice kitten heels.
10xgkny,She is making me feel rationally irritable with this garbage.
10xgkny,"She must have deleted her profile because searching her name gave zero results.

Good."
10xgkny,"And that it's exactly my problem with this post. My menopause experience was hell, my sister's experience was a lot tamer (by her own account) neither one of us claims to be the rule by which menopause should be measured."
10xgkny,Classic pick me.
10xgkny,"Can it be because she belongs to the school of women don't sweat or fart?!!! But seriously, I think we all know this type of woman who think of themselves as breezing through because that's what they were told to do. ""Don't inconvenience a man, ever"" 

I just can't with the level of BS"
10xgkny,Sounds like my own mother telling me  morning sickness was in my head because she never had it.   Fml take that shit elsewhere.
10xgkny,"I work with a woman who is like this and she's insufferable! Not because, in her words, she breezed through menopause, but because when the full table at lunch is talking about how menopause was for them she shakes her head with a pursed up mouth and says ""it doesn't have to be that way"". Like all the others somehow bought it on themselves. It drives me nuts."
10xgkny,and pregnancy was a breeze too üôÑ
10xgkny,100%
10xgkny,The fact that a woman like this has a very public column is giving me a very unnecessary hot flash
10xgkny,"Dear Lord, please do. This woman's privilege is too much"
10xgkny,"Exactly!! And too assume you know everything because your symptoms were XYZ!! Like damn, mine were EFG, everyone's different!"
10xgkny,"I just commented about the same thing! I sure hope she isn't a professional writer. Yet I see that specific grammatical error frequently these days, and it drives me bonkers."
10xgkny,And she doesn't even consider that many women go through menopause in their 30s. I was 38 when the doctor told me I was fully done and 100% menopausal. My symptoms were freaking hell and I had 2 eight year olds and a full time job.
10xgkny,"It's called blaming the victim.  We are responsible for age discrimination against us somehow, because we discuss if we struggle with menopause, as if keeping quiet somehow meant age discrimination didn't happen.  It did."
10xgkny,"The thing is, she's identifying some of the right issues while arguing all the wrong things! Yes, men who are sexist WILL USE women's hormones against them. As they have from time immemorial. Yes, she's identified another area in which men will use women's hormones as a weapon against us in the workplace.  

The argument is not - 'therefore women should pretend not to have hormones and should suck up any and all symptoms privately, without a peep!'

It actually should be - 'therefore we need to talk about it MORE openly, fund research that will keep women healthy and our bodies operating comfortably and safely, and not allow an employer's negative inferences about women's health to dictate how we navigate our profession.'

Because we currently have insufficient professional structures that keep employers from using periods of health crisis against us. We need MORE of this, not less. Maternity leave, paternity leave, time off for rehab when facing addiction, support for workers who have to be primary caregivers for a loved one in crisis - most of us agree we need to transition to a system in which health/mental health support is baked in to our professional systems. Why is adding 'menopause' to that list any different? We should all be in agreement already that we should have all kinds of safety regulations so that ANY health challenges can be met with support by our employers. 

IMO, that's the argument."
10xgkny,This is true feminism.
10xgkny,She used to be an editor for Vogue UK so maybe she's wealthy and incredibly out of touch. But the fact that she's striking women at one of the most stressful times in our lives tells me how she's been influenced by the patriarchy
10xgkny,oh the comparison with men was stupid.  My man doesn't really complain about aging or loss of virility despite being 45 (I was definitely going through meno then and suffering a great deal - 47 now still am).
10xgkny,"Oh hon.

I hope you get through today with minimal fuss and even fewer hot flashes. Big giant hugs if you want them.

(Up at 4:30 because my cat meowed in my ear and immediately my adhd brain served up all the crap still to do to pack up our house to move and taking four cats to our new home... God)"
10xgkny,How do they stay on her feet?!? That whole page is a train wreck.
10xgkny,"It took me forever to get through the article because, well, I‚Äôm menopausal, but also because I kept having intrusive thoughts about her shoes. I‚Äôm dying to watch her try to walk in them. And the fact that she thought they were a good choice in the first place should‚Äôve been a major red flag about the bullshit that was about to emanate from her brain in the article."
10xgkny,I‚Äôm glad someone else brought this up. Ima shame her feet I guess. Are all her toes the same length? I‚Äôve never seen that before. Yes I probably deserve downvotes for toe shaming but I‚Äôm freaked out.
10xgkny,Especially when they're on the Daily Mail's payroll.
10xgkny,I just read a bit about her and realised she has a history of hiding behind her privilege and throwing others under the bus. Not feeling quite so betrayed since she‚Äôs a proven turd of a human.
10xgkny,"There is definitely not endless talk, in my experience there's no fucking talk unless I instigate it and it's so noticeable I sometimes refer to menopause as the ""Great Silence"""
10xgkny,"Afaik Davina McCall has a book out about the peri/menopause and might have been promoting it a bit - still doesn't meet the definition of endless! The Mail generally take the attitude that they'd prefer that women (and minorities) didn't speak at all, so any is too much. Not to absolve her, she's taking the money to churn this hateful drivel out."
10xgkny,I totally relate to your experience!  It was humbling but insightful for me.
10xgkny,Why does your first sentence seem contradictory to the rest? Maybe I'm misreading/misunderstanding.
10xgkny,"I just knew, straight off the bat, that this would be a Daily Fail article. That rag is so predictable."
10xgkny,">You can be assured that if this was happening to men it would be acceptable for days off, openly sharing symptoms and lots of empathising/sympathy.

I get your point here, but I'm actually going to disagree. Our culture does not in any way embrace days off, openly sharing medical symptoms or anything of the kind -- for anything, really. We live in a ""work, work, work at all costs"" society, and men would be considered very weak/pussy/non-masculine, etc., if they openly complained about medical maladies at work or took a lot of time off for them. That kind of thing is not considered acceptable overall in the American workforce. But that's a whole other issue."
10xgkny,"üòÇ And YOU get an upvote! Lol, thanks for the giggle"
10xgkny,"Gen Xer in a rage about this, can confirm."
10xgkny,"Yes, found my people here!"

10xgkny,Because your cogent take is spot on and helpful?
10xgkny,"Right? It‚Äôs the definite article that does it for me. LMAO

(Is that a British-ism? Do Brits say ‚Äúthe‚Äù menopause?)"
10xgkny,"""the menopause"" is how it's referred to in the UK and is perfectly acceptable."
10xgkny,The use of the definite article just kills me! ü§£ ‚ÄúI have the bronchitis/the acne/the herpes!‚Äù

10xgkny," Yep, the ""not like the other girls"" kind of woman. You know, insufferable."
10xgkny,That was my mom!!  She also told me I was overreacting when my kids were born and I fell deep in post partum depression ü§Æ
10xgkny,I'm willing to bet money that this b has been on HRT for a long time and is all projection.
10xgkny,"Exactly. She has created a narrow view of women and of menopause. Very telling.
Sounds like you really kicked ass while this woman (I have to say it) appears to have the solitary struggle of keeping a sandal on her foot‚Ä¶that toe grip though. üòÇüòÇ"
10xgkny,"She doesn't even consider 40s, she is all in the mythical world where menopause only affects women in thier 50s and 60s (60s really? that's not menopause that's just age discrimination)"
10xgkny,"I'm 37 and I did not see it coming (even though now I remember my mom was about this age) but this started when I was 36 right as I got a promotion I worked for through the pandemic and now I'm extremely overwhelmed and incredibly sad and mad and my hot flashes are like I'm boiling from the Inside out,  I'm exhausted but anxiety keeps me awake or wakes me up a million times. I've thought about how pregnant women get leave/are protected etc. but what about us?"
10xgkny,"Thank you. It was a lovely funeral as they go but it's been a long day, I left because I started having a bad hot flush and my hair was starting to feel soaking lol now I understand why my mother in law would walk around with a tea towel around her neck lol I did a move almost 3 years ago with a dog and 3 cats so I know how daunting and hectic it can be so I wish you lots of luck with the move and hope you settle your cats and yourself into your new home. All the best üòÅ"
10xgkny,Yes! It‚Äôs the Great Silence!
10xgkny,"I'm sorry you relate to it because I totally wouldn't wish this on anyone! But at the same time it's good to know I wasn't alone. 

In my case, peri literally made me mentally ill (who even knew menopause-induced OCD was a thing?! But it is!). How dare this woman tell the world that it's not a big deal. For some women, it isn't and that's wonderful. For others, it's genuinely debilitating. They need help, not to be shamed and minimised."
10xgkny,"That was my reaction too. I think they meant ‚Äúdownplay‚Äù or ‚Äúdisguise,‚Äù because ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù certainly has a different meaning than I think they are intending!"
10xgkny,"You may be right that it might not be an acceptable thing in the American workforce. Days off are a bit more acceptable in Britain however where she is from and myself. And yes, wherever I have worked women talk about their issues. It should be more socially acceptable."
10xgkny,"I‚Äôm sure it is, I was just pointing out as a Canadian it sounded funny.  No disrespect on my part."
10xgkny,It is! She's simply bringing down women and perpetuating the stigma
10xgkny,"I couldn't get past ""the menopause"". Who says it that way???"
10xgkny,"I worked with a woman just like that, she got really easy light 3 day menstrual periods, no cramps, nothing. And then she got ovarian cysts and her whole tune changed"
10xgkny,You just set me up to laugh the rest of the day. Thank you! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

So, no, I don't think men would have an easier time in the workforce complaining about health maladies -- I think they feel the pressure to suck up their own shit in the same way we do. I know some dudes who had heart attacks who were worried about missing work. I'm not kidding. It's pretty crazy.

Yes, this culture is likely a bit saner in some other places -- although I do think that ethic has expanded across the globe in many cases, sadly. Work until you drop, don't take vacation -- or if you do, make yourself available on email and messenger at all times -- and never talk about being sick, because that makes you weak. Sad."

10yxv1p,"Whenever I get down on myself for gaining weight from meds, pandemic, and peri, and wish for the old days (which are actually quite recent) I think back to how controlling I really was over myself, and how much I bargained my mental health over pant size.

That‚Äôs the biggest reason I haven‚Äôt gone back to what I *could* be doing to ‚Äúget back in shape‚Äù, which is incredibly similar to the plan you typed. I was so in control, that I was actually out of control. Since 2020 I may have become lazier, but I‚Äôve also found some freedom in not being a clean-eating, low-carb, Les Mills obsessed gym rat (though I stand by the fact that Les Mills class are fun AND change your body‚Äî I‚Äôm not knocking those, just knocking how much I did them). Some days (usually the hot ones that require less clothing) I wish I had the discipline again to do two classes a day and then go run for an hour, six days a week‚Äî but most days I‚Äôve decided to love myself instead, in spite of what size I am.

10yxv1p,I see he‚Äôs part of the ‚Äòthis is easy for me and therefore should be easy for everyone‚Äô club. I too used to think this way until hormone‚Äôs kicked my ass.

10yxv1p,"I'm so glad that my hubs knows to keep his big mouth shut about that stuff. Don't get me wrong he can be a major jerk who likes to stick his 2 cents into shit that he has no business talking about but I can always count on him telling me I'm a hot piece of ass anytime I get upset about my looks. Just the other day I told him I wanted to redo the bathroom because I hated to look in the multiple giant mirrors. He assured me I'm still hot, then pulled out the project notebook to write down what I wanted to change. He definitely got a blowy that night"
10yxv1p,"Cardio at that level will push your hormones to shit but everyone is at choice. For women, I think focusing on weight lifting/weight bearing exercises are more beneficial than cardio. I have no medical training so don‚Äôt take anything I say really seriously. But I‚Äôm 53, hypothyroid, and have hormone issues (on HRT), and I‚Äôve found focusing on weight lifting etc to be more helpful. I‚Äôve struggled with weight loss for my entire life. I‚Äôm accepting my body as it is and just exercising for maintenance of health, staving off osteoporosis etc. If I lose weight, bonus."
10yxv1p,"Ha ha ha ha, yeah. My first instinct is to slam him upside the head with whatever I'm holding at the moment I heard such bullcrap.

How is it possible that such an enlightened individual is able to chew gum and walk upright at the same time? Show us the way oh fast metabolizer.

Tell him menopausal women of the world thank him for his wisdom, and to not go out in public for the next 45 years."

10yxv1p,And ty this did make me laugh out loud! For real lol
10yxv1p,I followed that diet advice several years ago and lost 40# in short order. I have maintained that loss into menopause but I have not been able to drop the remaining 50 I need to lose.  Tell him to I said to fuck all the way off giving weight loss advice to a menopausal women. He is clueless
10yxv1p,"The most it's safe to lose in a week is around 2 pounds, I believe. 10 pounds in a month could be okay for a longer month. But definitely not in a week, that's crazy."
10yxv1p,Marie kondo is ass to the street!
10yxv1p,I have some pigs that are always hungry....
10yxv1p,You should remind him that men and women often lose weight differently and that this works for him because he has a stable hormonal system. I personally suggest you remind him of this as you hold his head in the toilet for a royal swirly.

Mine also states that I've always been like this, and if I'm upset/ grumpy/ depressed it's just my ""nastiness"" and ""attitude""."
10yxv1p,"Oh my god. Is your husband hoping to lose his dick in a bobbit sequel?    Yikes.   

Losing 10 pounds a week is not healthy!  

This advice is pretty aggressive.   He‚Äôs not a doctor nor a very empathetic person.  But I will say that I have been cutting way back on refined carbs and sugar, decreasing calories and increasing exercise and I‚Äôve lost a couple of pounds in a month.   It‚Äôs slow going. And hard. And even beyond the weight loss I‚Äôm finding that I need more movement and exercise now, and I am a Pilates teacher and former dancer and athlete who‚Äôs always been active.   

The hormonal changes are rough!   Most of us gain weight and it‚Äôs very hard to lose it at this stage of life.   But making healthy and sustainable changes for our health can help us in many ways beyond weight loss. We all have to find what works for us.  It‚Äôs not fun. But once the changes make you feel better it gets easier."
10yxv1p,"I‚Äôm madly in love with my husband, but I would not hesitate to cut him if he said any of this crap."

I blamed it on eating breaking my strict 29 WW points per day diet by starting to eat 1 eggo waffle in the mornings with my ADHD meds when I started taking them 10 years ago. This is the kind of shit that creeps into my head when I can‚Äôt sleep. WTF?!?! 

I‚Äôve tried to go back to exactly what I ate per day back then (because I was so obsessive about what I ate that I remember this in detail) and I always end up nauseated by hunger with a migraine by noon (this is *before* adding in an hour of cardio and doing 10 billion steps). I‚Äôm trying to accept that if have to work that hard and deprive myself that much to wear a size 6, then that‚Äôs just not the size I‚Äôm supposed to be. Could I stand lose 20 lbs? Yes because my feet and hips would be much happier for it, but I‚Äôm definitely not going back to that 1200 calories + 20K steps + logging every bite I eat in a day bullshit."

And that‚Äôs true; if you don‚Äôt work on maintenance then one will always be in a yo-yo relationship with gaining and losing, and at one time the medical community said that yo-yoing is very bad for health (not sure if that‚Äôs still considered true)."
10yxv1p,"Aww, you‚Äôre very nice to say that. Because I definitely feel much lazier when it comes to self care and my health. üòÇ 

I do have things to show for how I‚Äôve spent my time instead of 18 hours a week working out, so at least there‚Äôs that.

And it does help to see some of the old Instagram fitness influencers I followed years ago also come to a realization in the past few years about living life outside of counting calories and a gym. I can‚Äôt bring myself to follow the newer fitness influencers because on one hand I feel like I might still be too easily influenced and fall back into near-obsession, and on the other hand I know the private obsessive behaviors many of them go through to be able to have their platform (that I think they don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre negatively affected by yet) and can‚Äôt buy what they‚Äôre selling because I‚Äôve seen behind the curtain."
10yxv1p,"Yes you can work out at home with these! A couple of options: You can buy the Les Mills app for I think $15 a month, which includes the classes I was taking (they offered a cheaper subscription last month, not sure if they still do, but it doesn‚Äôt come with the best classes). Or, you can search YouTube and find classes that instructors put there for their Les Mills certifications (trying it out this way would probably be better than jumping into paying for the app in case you don‚Äôt like the classes). I used to go to the gym for these because I like the accountability required and social aspect, and moving and Covid changed that for me‚Äî but you might be able to find a gym near you where they‚Äôre offered.

My schedule was to do Combat, Attack, Body Pump, and RPM (which is spinning). I‚Äôd add on one they used to have called Flow now and then too, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs offered still but their website doesn‚Äôt mention it (it does have something called ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù, which might just be Flow rebranded). My gym would schedule three of these back-to-back in the mornings, so I‚Äôd choose Body Pump (my favorite; and yes I know you‚Äôre not supposed to lift every day but it was fun and I was young üòÇ), plus another (then I‚Äôd run after that).

If you‚Äôre working out at home, you‚Äôll need (or at least want) a combination of hand weights, plates, an exercise step or bench, and a bar (the plates and bar is required for Body Pump). I found a bar/plates set on Amazon after I lost that gym (moved) for under $50 (granted this was 2017 so prices may have increased‚Ä¶ but maybe on OfferUp or Marketplace you can find a deal).

The weights used in some of the classes in combination with some of the classes being sort of like HIIT made me burn a lot of calories. After you get used to the weight you‚Äôre lifting and it‚Äôs easy, that‚Äôs a sign to add a little on‚Ä¶ I would add periodically and that helped with building muscle. I credit the diet to most of my shrinking at first, but the weights and movement definitely are responsible for shape/tone and how clothing fit. All this said‚Äî I was also 30 at the time I started with a faster metabolism than today, and just had a baby a couple months before so really I had nowhere to go but down especially in the beginning. (Typing all this out makes me wonder if I should experiment for the sake of curiosity and comparison, to see how now- more than a decade later- I‚Äôd fare if I did it all again. üòÇ Then I‚Äôll know how much I can blame peri.)"
10yxv1p,"Ex-husband. Holy shit, yes, that‚Äôs him. He was so pissed when they discontinued Twinkies and I would find empty boxes of Ho-Hos and Hostess cupcakes buried in the back of the cupboards. 

When he met his new wife he posted something on Instagram with some dish he made from seitan raving about how she‚Äôs vegan and now he‚Äôs going vegan to get healthy. I just started laughing thinking about him trying to hide a T-bone in the back of the cupboard ü§£ There‚Äôs NO WAY someone who brags about how much he loves tripe soup ever stuck to being vegan ü§¢"
10yxv1p,It‚Äôs all good. I divorced him and found one of the good ones.
10yxv1p,I like it.

10yxv1p,"Oh. Yeah, heard that one, too."
10yxv1p,Came here to say the exact thought. Or a Dolores Claiborne ending.
10yxv1p,My husband just bought a mini excavator!! üòÇ
10yxv1p,Cement boots and a nap with the fish?
10yxv1p,You‚Äôre hysterical! (And my hero!)
10yxv1p,"Thank you for your detailed response. I will check out what‚Äôs YT, I currently go to a small boutique gym with small class numbers, one on one personal trainer who gives you exercises that you can physically handle. I enjoy going but I‚Äôm starting to find it boring with the repetitive side of it. I love dancing and Pilates, so I‚Äôm going to try and find some free stuff on YT and go from there."
10yxv1p,"Oh hell yes! I wish you were near me. Besides the nefarious reasons I could have used it the last few days! Every thing hurts, but at least I will sleep"
10yxv1p,Once the flesh starts to  rot the ankles or knees separate. That is how you get a floater.  Decomposition is NOT your friend
10yxv1p,Close. Slit the belly and sink them. As long as there is active wildlife in the pond/lake the body won't last long. Dental ID should be considered.
10yxv1p,Well shit.
10yxv1p,You have to cut through both intestines. I wouldn't put them anywhere there are otters those bitches are snitches. Teeth are always a problem.
10yxv1p,You have to cut through both intestines. I wouldn't put them anywhere there are otters those bitches are snitches. Teeth are always a problem.
10yxv1p,"Hypothetically, I can come up with 3 better ways of body disposal with just just the stuff in my garage & 2 others at work, off the top of my head.  I'm a twisted planner who has seen some shit & has a military background.   Like Uncle Sam likes to beat into us jarhead (Marines) ""Always be prepared to improvise"""
10yxv1p,Also floats.
10yxv1p,"That, my friend, is what woodchippers are for. Point that baby near a fast-flowing river, problem solved!"
10yxv1p,"I'm down, I have the blue industrial barrels. Jk. Am I?"
10yxv1p,"Just watched a true crime show where the guy got busted because a si gle tooth ended up on the banks and nit the water.
Also you need to freeze the body and cut it up into smaller pieces for the wood chipper."
10yxv1p,"Hey, it (almost) worked for Richard Krafts, why not? Though you're correct - definitely have to take dental ID into account. 

Of course, someone did offer a large vat or two. Who's bringing the sulfuric acid?"
10yxv1p,Acid works if you have a place to dump the excess & time. Sulfuric acid turns the fat in you body into soap. As the body breaks down it delutes the acid to the point it stops working. You have to periodically empty some liquid & add more acid. Also full barrels are incredibly heavy to move.
1136ip5,My best advice is that I promise you; looks are very deceiving.
1136ip5,"Not sure if these are words of encouragement but... There's a lot of us out there.  You may not see us much because we are hiding indoors and anxiety takes over when we try to socialize. I started being more open about peri with others and got a lot of ""me too!""  Now there's a group of us.  We don't talk all the time, sometimes we communicate with grunts and nods lol."
1136ip5,"I went through this when my daughter was in grammar school. I had her at 43. I started as slim and sophisticated and seemingly overnight became dumpy and shunned. I couldn't figure it out except I had depression at the same time. 

The community was uppity as well. But the school was close to our home. I relied on my artistic talents which always saved me from bullying in my school years and volunteered to help the art teacher. To my daughter, I was a hero showing up and helping her classmates learn to draw. The kids liked me too. The parents stayed stuck up, and I ignored them. 

What's funny now, is I am postmenopausal and they are just starting the onslaught!  LOLOL 

Plus, they are not happily busy, I assure you."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm 46 with a 6 year old, you‚Äôre not alone!"
1136ip5,I am 52 with a 6 year old.  That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got.
1136ip5,"I know how you feel, I'm 46 with 8 and 11 year old. I'm having a slump at the moment and probably look about 60 to the young mums. I hate the thought of people looking at me thinking I could either be granny or mum ü§£. I honestly swing between having a good face/hair day, and looking like I'm 70 in the same week.

But, on a positive note, I honestly think we got the best generation. I mean the young mums all seem so polished, and botoxed, tanned etc. It must be exhausting being from younger generations! And I wouldn't give up our experience, of having lived both before and after the the Internet, for anything. We have lots of awesome wisdom to pass to our kids üòÄ. 

Seriously though, everyone has their own worries. I bet the younger ones look at you and think you look super confident and sorted!"
1136ip5,"I‚Äôll be 51 next week and my youngest is 5. I feel you, it can be brutal. I just started hormones 6 months ago and wish I had started years ago. You definitely need to find something that you can do every day to relax yourself. In the evenings I take a long hot shower to destress."
1136ip5,"I can tell you, you‚Äôre doing great! You have a kid who loves you and vice versa. I‚Äôm 46 with a 5 year old, so I get it. I look at the other moms and feel older than I should, but it is what it is. She‚Äôs happy, loved and well taken care of. I guarantee you she wouldn‚Äôt trade you for any other mom. Go easy on yourself and try to focus on what you do have instead of what you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll never be an Instagram mom and that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm just glad if I get to take a shower at the end of the day or pluck that one annoying chin hair I always get. You‚Äôre not alone and we‚Äôre all just doing our best! Hugs mama!"
1136ip5,"I'm 2 years behind you but the anxiety is already here. There are three mums I can tolerate speaking to in the mornings. They feel like my tribe.

The rest are like an alien race to me. I sometimes listen to them chatting in the playground and the conversations make me even more determined to pull my hoodie strings tighter and keep my head down. I don't mean to judge them in a nasty way, but I can't help feeling very glad to not feel like I need to be a part of that. They talk about their nails and other surface level stuff.

I talk to the older mums about how knackered and hormonal I am and how I like them but I hate making small talk in the playground. I simply can't be arsed.

Luckily they get it. A couple of them are becoming good friends who I have a blast with on play dates in my messy house."
1136ip5,I'm 50 with a 7 and 8 year old. I definitely understand how you feel. Most of the time I feel like a grandmother even though my kids are young. It's menopause and depression for me. I can't seem to snap out of it.
1136ip5,42 with a 4 year old. Feel this.
1136ip5,"I'm 42 and my kids are adults and do not live with my husband and I and I still find it hard to make friends where I am. Everyone is young with young kids around where I live and everything is geared at families with young kids too. 

Lol sorry to hijack but yeah it's kinda the same but not. Just a different part of the spectrum."
1136ip5,"I'm a few years older with a kid a couple of years younger.  There's lots of us; we are all just trying to pretend that we're not in the thick of it so that the younger moms keep inviting us/our kids to things.  But I promise you, whenever I start being real with the younger moms they start being real with me, and their lives are just as much of a hot mess as mine is, even if it's in a different way.

Let's normalize leaning on and supporting each other.  Even those moms who might reject us this year because they don't understand yet are going to circle back with us in the next year or two.  Welcome them with open arms."
1136ip5,"I am your age. You are not old. It is normal if you had kids late. I understand  the mess of peri menopause. Find a good doctor and supplements or HRT. 
Breathe. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôve got a 7 year old and am the oldest mom. Whatever. We are established, have shit together (most of the time), and are out of f$cks to give. You are only a wallflower of you see yourself as one. So don‚Äôt. Be fearless. At this age, we have earned it"
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm sorry I have no advice or helpful comments, I just want to send a hug and encouragements and my best wishes that you may find the strength that you need to see how worthy and important you are."
1136ip5,"I am 47 with a 16, 13 and 8 year old!  It all good !"
1136ip5,"Just here to say, I am 50 with a 10, 8 and 6 year old. I workout and try to eat decent. I promise you, I can run circles around most moms half my age in my area. On the other hand, I have more anxiety, less sleep and an increasing amount of ‚Äúsenior moments‚Äù!  Lol."
1136ip5,"48 with an 8 year old here
Don‚Äôt put much stock in how the younger crowd presents, it‚Äôs mostly an illusion bc they still have fucks to give.  I ran out of those a few years ago."
1136ip5,just solidarity here (early 40s perimenopausal mess mom of a 3-year-old)
1136ip5,"Don‚Äôt compare your insides to other people‚Äôs outsides.

One of my impressions from kindergarten was that some moms are 25, some are 45.  Pros and cons to all the age ranges."
1136ip5,"Oh lord. I hear ya! I‚Äôm 48 with a 7 year old and I feel 1000 years older than all Moms at the Elementary school.  I swear the teachers are 20 years younger than me.  Our next door neighbor has 3 kids around my my child‚Äôs age and she‚Äôs like 25 and we have such a hard time connecting.  
I‚Äôm so awkward.  
I do have younger friends with young kids but they are work friends so we have something in common."
1136ip5,"I am one of these moms you speak of. (I lurk to educate myself for what is to come.) We are hanging on by a thread.  I have got 2 under 6 and I‚Äôve had one shower in the last 5 days, i forgot to renew my car insurance last week, and there‚Äôs valentines stickers EVERYWHERE. 

But on a side note - I hang out with the grandmothers who bring their kids to school because they‚Äôre amazing. They have no tolerance for bullshit and I get to live vicariously through their retired/semi-retired adventures. They‚Äôre the best. I am their aspiring sidekick."
1136ip5,"Been there too - when I was 47 my youngest was 8. I felt like an outcast too, particularly since it seemed like I was one of the only moms who worked. (No idea how those families afforded houses where we live). But I made one really good friend (just one year younger) thru those sports games and after school activities. And now she and I travel together and are planning to retire nearby each other!! It gets better."
1136ip5,I'm 42 with a 6 year old daughter. She's being evaluated for autism and adhd next week. I don't even know the other moms because my daughter has no friends due to her social delays and behavior issues. My nearly 13 year old is already diagnosed with autism so even though I was younger with him it's been exhausting and lonely. Dealing with early signs of peri and realizing I'll be hitting the worst of it when she hits puberty. Dreading it. You're definitely not alone. Plenty of us tired advanced maternal age moms out there.
1136ip5,I am 47 with a 11 year old. It sucks especially with the yummy mummy thing going on at school. I don‚Äôt have any school mom friends at all.
1136ip5,"I would try not to make assumptions about how they truly feel, unless you‚Äôre very close personal friends with all your child‚Äôs classmate‚Äôs moms. I really don‚Äôt mean that harshly. People have different thresholds when it comes to self-disclosure, just because people look like they‚Äôve got it all and are managing it doesn‚Äôt mean they do and are."
1136ip5,"Eight days from 50 with a 13yo. We homeschool but I feel this on the soccer pitch. Especially since the soccer community has a lot of military families, these moms are popping out kids when they're barely out of high school. So really feeling that age difference! I just own the fact that my kid thinks I'm cool, and I'll get out and drill with her."
1136ip5,"43 with a 6 year old!!!  I have found this sub to be incredibly helpful.  HRT is helping me deal with anxiety and those low days.  
I have struggled finding common ground with some of the younger moms at school, but at one event we were talking about how nice it was and I mentioned gardening - now they think I‚Äôm a gardening guru and all want help with vegetable gardens!  
I will never have the desire to join their moms night out (I‚Äôm tired!), but having my own interests helps me.  I do strength training now and I‚Äôm not a size 2 but I find I can keep up with the kids on field day!  
Also being a bit older we are close to being debt free - I‚Äôll take that over a brand new car!
You got this momma, we are here to cheer you on and comfort you.  And tell you to keep tweezers in your car for the random chin hair lol."
1136ip5,49 yo with 11 yo girl representing. I got you. We got this.
1136ip5,"I know you feel tired, but maybe change the view point as going slower so you can fully enjoy and be present while she's young.  I look back and realize what a frantic lunatic I was trying to get it all done."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm an older mom as well and know how you feel. I have chronic health issues that make me feel way older not to mention all the menopause stuff. However, I have met a lot of women my age who are grandparents, and they act so old. When I remember these women, I actually feel young at heart and that makes me proud. Having younger kids really helps me stay out of the old lady frame of mind!"
1136ip5,"You are absolutely killing it. Truly. I have no idea how you are parenting in the middle of this peri nightmare. 

I would also suggest that behind closed doors and away from Instagram the younger, confident and busy mums are feeling stressed AF, insecure, resentful, alone, and every other thing. 

I am 41 and in peri hell from a hysterectomy 2.5 years ago and have a bunch of health conditions that make every hour of every day bloody hard (endometriosis among them). I am barely keeping it together. So I have no idea how you are doing this. You‚Äôre amazing."
1136ip5,I‚Äôm a 48 year old with a 7 year old and it‚Äôs fun times being the old ass mom who is forgetful of everything and in a constant state of panic. I‚Äôm seriously wondering if I just messed up a lucrative job offer because I got distracted and instead of sending a reply email to my potential boss it was saved in drafts and threee days later I realize this and hit send. Now it‚Äôs been a week and no response. My forgetfulness and level for distraction is scary and I feel old and stupid with making careless Mistakes. I can‚Äôt see anything now with my regular glasses I have to remove them to read things up close I‚Äôm near sighted. I don‚Äôt have any mom friends my age it sucks. They are all ten to twelve years younger than me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1136ip5,"
I‚Äôm 39 with a 4 year old and there‚Äôs parents in my class in their mid to late 40s. If they are going thru bad peri symptoms, I can‚Äôt tell. The older ones appear more fit and laid back. I don‚Äôt feel bad about not wearing the same style as the 23 year olds. 

We attend a mixed inside the city preschool so about half the class has parents in their 20s and the other half is parents like us. 

 The school decided to start a new class that divided up the prek4 kids into 2 groups, the new group is a Kinderbridge that allows 5 and 6 year olds who are a little socially and academically ahead. We noticed that all the kids moved to the new Kinderbridge class all had more senior parents."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm 55 with an 11-year-old, my only child. I hear you loud and clear. I had those insecurities but then half the young, confident mom‚Äôs started getting divorced and the kids would tell mine how lucky she is and ask to come to our house. It‚Äôs hard on a kid having your parents still ‚Äúfinding‚Äù themselves when you‚Äôre a tween."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm 49, with a 7 & 9 year old.  Most of my friends (not very many, though, to be sure!) are least 10 years younger than me, but to their credit, they don‚Äôt seem to care.  It is a little weird when we start talking about when we graduated high school‚Ä¶I was actually teaching people their age my first few years of teaching."
1136ip5,"I am you, but 5 years down the road. I'm 52 and my youngest daughter is almost 14.

One thing I did witness recently is how my (ahem) many experiences have actually helped me better coach my daughter. I looked at a much younger mom when we were both dealing with a situation and realized she was a good 15 years from learning the lessons I've recently learned about life. I felt more gracious toward her (precious thing hasn't learned what I've learned yet!) and was thankful for my perspective."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm the same age as you with a 6 and 10 year old. I see you, and I empathize, but I‚Äôm so happy with the perspective our age provides. There are more of us than you realize, we are just busy being chill and not performing our parenting so visibly.
ETA: yes, peri sucks and I wish I slept more."
1136ip5,I see you! I am 50 with a 12 yr old.
1136ip5,"46 with an 11yo here, you are doing just fine. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to the others!"
1136ip5,"53 year old with a 17, 14, and 9 year old checking in. We got this!"
1136ip5,46 with a 7 and 11 year old. Last week at the trampoline park a young mom I was with was doing actual front flips with the kids üòÇ. Definitely there are trade offs but for me personally I know my kids are better off than they would have been if I‚Äôd had them early.
1136ip5,52 with a 5 year old - I feel you! There's lots of us ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1136ip5,"51 with a 10 year old. The worst of the hot flashes are behind me, but the brain fog remains. I am more confident in myself despite it all, and have no ability to give a f*ck about superficial crap. So I feel like I am still doing ok. They are spending fortunes to look 25 and I am very aware that at this point , it is what it is."
1136ip5,"I had a son at 25 and a daughter at 38. Both times I felt like the other parents were superior to me, just for different reasons. It‚Äôs a natural reaction, it‚Äôs just not accurate. I can tell you that no one but you even thinks about your age, certainly not your daughter. In a few years your daughters friends will be hanging out at your house talking to you appreciating the different perspective you have from their parents. 

But more importantly care for you, cause no one else will. I took BCPs all the way until 55 and it was the smartest thing I have ever done. Just say you are having extra heavy periods. I took yazmin. Estrogen is everything ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1136ip5,"Only words of encouragement is you're still young 47 ain't ancient, heck some of my older relatives would call you a kid still, they do that with me and I'm 50, you're still young, you're still youthful, enjoy life, old saying
Old enough to know better
Still young enough not to care"
1136ip5,"I was a young mom and I promise you that my looks were just about the only thing going well in my life when my daughter was 9. It was all a facade.

You really never know what is going on in a person‚Äôs life. Parenting is hard. Being a woman is hard. I‚Äôll be forever grateful for the older moms who took me under their wing back then."
1136ip5,"I had my first child at 30 and all the moms from the playgroup my son went to became my best friends. There was a mom who was 27, and everyone else was 5-10 years older than me.  They are still my best friends!  


You have people out there - you just need to find them."
1136ip5,"That was me. I got on HRT. I‚Äôm 49 now and she‚Äôs 13 and just got her first period so yeahhhhhh

Don‚Äôt compare yourself to Other moms. Just be your own best version. I actually lvoe being an older mom bc I have more money and can give my kid a better life. Plus I‚Äôm Alllll the way settled down.
We have a good life. You can too

I also don‚Äôt even hang out with classmates moms so
Who cares how old they are. We have totally
Different interests"
1136ip5,"I had my second and last  baby at 38.  There were mostly younger mons at my kids schools, but i always would dress for confidence and join the pta and made friends and never had any problems.  No one ever said anything.  Not even the kids.  We all look aincient to them!"
1136ip5,"Hey, I‚Äôm 51 and I‚Äôd like to be 47. üòâ"
1136ip5,"I also have this issue‚Ä¶young kid, feel old & isolated from the younger moms. Some of them may experience it when the kids are in middle school or high school"
1136ip5,I felt out of place as a mid 30s mum with a 9-year-old. All these cheerful found love early young breeders are not my jam. Also don‚Äôt invite me to church. I‚Äôm fun.
1136ip5,I'm sure I look confident when I'm out in public.
1136ip5,"""happily busy"" - are you sure about that? Could be a fa√ßade."
1136ip5,47 with an 8 and a 6 year old here. You‚Äôre doing great!
1136ip5,"I had my second child at 38, so can relate. Couldn't care less at the time about what other mothers did or what they looked like. NB. One thing I remember though was a glamorous young mum who had a son in my child's class, a baby daughter and a doting husband... He left her and the kids for a 20-something girl; apparently a mid-40s crisis! My husband can be annoying as hell, but at least he's still around."
1136ip5,46 with an 11 year old. Right here with you. And it‚Äôs all a facade!
1136ip5,51 with a 13 year old! Hormones are raging in opposite directions around this joint!
1136ip5,"I wonder in which country are you. Where I live, most moms where around my age, my kid is 10, l‚Äôm 52 but most of the other moms are more or less the same, some are much younger but I‚Äôm closer to the ones that are not"
1136ip5,"I'm 50 with a 13 year old and a 10 year old. I'm also an immigrant and late-diagnosed (at 48) autistic.

After second grade, I never had a ""friend group"" or ""gal pals"" or any of that other stuff ""normal"" women do. I was opinionated, overeducated, political, and weird. I have trouble keeping lasting friendships but made it worse by moving a lot, finally moving to Europe to get out of the US.

Here I encounter people who have known each other for decades, who spend their weekends with their close knit families or old friends, and often feel left out or flat out lonely, despite managing a family of three neurodivergent people so not having much peace.

And there's a lot more of a rigidly binary understanding of gender here.

And having kids didn't automatically help me be liked or fit in. Unfortunately.

I like to focus on those friends who do text me back, who are interested in finding time for me, who are loyal.  Usually weird, smart, political women, but some men too. They understand my health issues, like not going out evenings or tolerating alcohol."
1136ip5,You got this mama. Get some help with your symptoms. Try acupuncture. But also Mama You got this! You had a life before your daughter. So Now you can show up and she is so much more important that whoever you are comparing yourself to.
1136ip5,"Not a mom but a menopausal woman and I think most women just worry too much in general about what people think when most people these days give zero fucks about other people ( sadly) They are so busy taking pictures of themselves that they aren‚Äôt even looking at you.   ‚ù§Ô∏èI didn‚Äôt have kids because my mom was shitty, so as long as you are supporting your child you ROCK SISTER!!!!!   Who cares how old you are.   You know way more than them and like I said.  They aren‚Äôt looking."
1136ip5,"It could be worse, she could be a teenager ü§£"
1136ip5,50 with a 13 year old... this post is relatable!
1136ip5,Not esp but I'm a 46 peri with a 4 yr old who frankly feels like I'm falling apart so I understand..but I had an older mum who had an older Mum herself.  I understood that I had a cleverer Mum who had had a rich life . Who'd really wanted kids when she had them not rushed into it. I was proud of her for having a life that involved a good career and wasn't just a baby maker. I don't have the good career but I've had a good life. Hell have people to run around with don't worry. And one thing I notice is when you bump into others our age we click quicker and stronger and don't seem to have that competitiveness the younger mums seem to give off. I've made some of the better girl friends than I have in years. With women I've met only here or there and we make an effort to meet up even not living close.  So we aren't as unusual as all that these days.. I can imagine 9 is going to be harder tho..not looking forward to that .Good luck
1136ip5,I feel this post so much. I turn 50 in June. Have 2 kids aged 9 and 11 and feel very out of place at school pick-ups and drop-offs.
1136ip5,"I was a 25 yo mom of a four yr old and felt so inadequate. Other moms were pulled together, successful and confident and I felt like I was none of those things. 
I am now a 50 yo mother of a 12 yo (we had a big gap), and I‚Äôm definitely older than the other mothers, tired and rarely put together. The difference for me is I no longer care. I guarantee you those young moms have shit going on too. 
You‚Äôre doing fine. Take care of yourself and be kind to you. Easier said than done I can attest."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm 51 with an 8-year old daughter. She will turn 9 in 2 months.  I 100% struggle with feelings of inferiority every time I bring them to activities or school.  

Either the moms are 15-20 years younger and I feel excluded, invisible, and dumpy. Or the moms my age‚Äî- like the ones I went to high school with‚Äî- have grown adult children or even grandchildren at this point.

The best consolation that I have is KNOWING that when I was in my 20s and 30s, I was not equipped emotionally or financially to start having children. I was married to an alcoholic, unfaithful man-child while I was trying to finish graduate studies. We divorced and I‚Äôm married to his polar opposite. I am thankful to the moon that I do not have to communicate with my ex-husband. No playing tug of war, fighting over who gets the kids on which weekend and who pays for what. My kids‚Äô lives would have been waaaay worse if I had them when I was in my 20s and 30s."
1136ip5,I was over 40 when I had my daughter. Everybody's struggling.
1136ip5,44 with a 12yo and an almost 6yo!!! You got this:-)
1136ip5,"I am 50 and I have an 11-year-old daughter. It‚Äôs brutal. Not only am I in the full throes of menopause, but she just started her period. The hormonal imbalance in this house is nuts! I had made it three months without a period, she starts hers, and mine shows back up. Damn her lol! I‚Äôm surprised my husband hasn‚Äôt moved out‚Ä¶."
1136ip5,"I‚Äôm 47 with a 4-year-old!  

What would it take for you to be the mom you want to be? 

For me, it took hrt ‚Äî especially the progesterone which helped with anxiety.

I wouldn‚Äôt compare yourself to the other moms.     Find how to be the mom you want."
1136ip5,"Here's some encouragement. Before you know it, your daughter will be in middle school, and the ""classmate mom"" pressure magically goes away. 

Elementary school mom cliques and judgement are brutal. Been there, done that. Once my daughter entered 6th grade -- much bigger school, older kids -- all that shit dissipated. 

(Had daughter at almost 37, she's 15 now)"
1136ip5,45 with a 9 year old üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1136ip5,"Well, the good point is that you don‚Äôt have a teenager during perimenopause that‚Äôs a terrible mix I‚Äôm in, lol. Hopefully you‚Äôll get yourself sorted out hormonally before the teenage years. I‚Äôm trying hormonal therapy as I‚Äôm already on antidepressants and ADHD medication which is really not working anymore because I‚Äôm perimenopausal you can just try anti-depressants if it‚Äôs anxiety your suffering from and you don‚Äôt want to take hormones. Either way you should try something because giving up caffeine alcohol your stressful job meditation- all of the holistic answers are pretty much bullshit. I say this because I am really healthy thin and I‚Äôve always eaten really well and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to give up my one cup of coffee a day and a few glasses of white wine."
1136ip5,"I'm 48 with a 22 year old. When my daughter was 9 and I was in my 30's  I was certainly not problem free no matter how it looked.

Every family has stuff to deal with whether it be parent or child health problems, marital problems, addiction, money troubles, etc. It is what it is."
1136ip5,"46 yr old.mom.of a 7 yr old here, I'm also autistic and likely ADHD. I am not the mom my kid deserves unfortunately."
1136ip5,I‚Äôm 37 with a kid that age. Trust me all the other moms are not confident or happy
1136ip5,I‚Äôm in the same boat!
1136ip5,"I am 49 with 7 year olds, I feel so out of place among the lovely young moms. Trying to have a cheerful disposition helps a bit."
1136ip5,2nded and 3rded.
1136ip5,Oh yes: this.
1136ip5,"In the age of social media, these younger moms look and act happy in public, but I can bet in reality they are not. In the suburb where I live, the stay at home moms seem the most sad to me, in the way some of them are such obvious strivers. I do not envy them their youth and/or their stay at home status."
1136ip5,"This is my friend group‚Äîwe‚Äôre all the ‚Äúold moms‚Äù. There‚Äôs a group of 4 of us moms whose kids are all friends‚Äîwhen the kids get together, we get together and compare notes on new peri symptoms."
1136ip5,So true! Thank you.
1136ip5,That‚Äôs awesome. ‚ÄúDumpy and shunned‚Äù hits the nail on the head for me. You are amazing for holding your head high and pushing through it.
1136ip5,I bet ALL of their kids love you. You taught them to draw! That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd remember forever.
1136ip5,"Exactly the same situation here.  Dumpy + shunned for being a chubby graying mom at the posh private school.   I make an effort but if they can‚Äôt see past the surface, it‚Äôs okay."
1136ip5,49 with a just turned 7 year old. They are keeping us young.
1136ip5,Me too! Actually I‚Äôm gonna be 46
1136ip5,"51 with a 9 year old and an 11 year old. Lots of other older moms at my kids' schools, thankfully.  Solidarity!"
1136ip5,GenX bringing it!
1136ip5,Love this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è  I always look at the younger mams & wonder how much earlier than me they have to get up to look like that!
1136ip5,Thank you so much üòä
1136ip5,"I love how much we have in common. Now I want to: a) buy a hoodie, and b) move to wherever you live and join your tribe."
1136ip5,"I feel you. I‚Äôm 45 with no kids and have felt the same way. I have found that if I ask moms to go do something they are usually game as long as we plan ahead, which is preferable for me anyway. They usually won‚Äôt be the ones to initiate plans, but they are happy for a chance to get out of the house and do something."
1136ip5,‚ù§Ô∏è
1136ip5,I had my first at 27 and most of the women in my mothers group were at least 10 years older than me- that‚Äôs just the demographic where I live. I felt so young and inexperienced and poor and so  further behind in my career than all of them. I used to worry about meet ups because I couldn‚Äôt afford anything but a coffee and I could t invite them to my place because we were renting a tiny run down apartment while they all had lovely houses. There‚Äôs every chance the younger mums the OP knows find her intimidating.
1136ip5,Btw I‚Äôm 46 this year. And I have a kind of Arthitis through my spine so I move like I‚Äôm 60 lol
1136ip5,I needed to hear this. Thanks üòä
1136ip5,"Almost me too. 49 with a 22, 17, 13 and 9 year old. My 9 year old now has a teacher that graduated with my 22 year old. My daughters classmate is the granddaughter of the office lady that is my exact age. Look for the older moms. There are some out there."

1136ip5,Interesting üßê
1136ip5,Excellent perspective. Thank you
1136ip5,How do you get on hrt and how do you know if you need it üôèüèª is it bio identical hormones or I don‚Äôt even know. What kind of hrt do you use. I wonder if I need that üôèüèª
1136ip5,"So, so true. I need to remember this"
1136ip5,"I was also 38 when I had my youngest.  Honestly I agree with you.  I'm pretty sure she and her 2 slightly older sibs never noticed a thing about me or my advanced age while I was going through peri---too busy with their activities and friends and schoolwork, thank goodness."
1136ip5,I would love to see you in church üíÉüèª

1136ip5,Took the words outta my mouth.
1136ip5,"Oh I want an old moms group! I was just commenting recently that it's been lonely being an older mom (48 with 8 year old). It's funny that moms with grown children (in their 30s) have been reaching out to me lately though, the universe must have heard me haha."
1136ip5,I‚Äôm 42 and Peri - I‚Äôm at the primary school gates for 2.5 more years
1136ip5,"Thanks. One of the benefits of long-term depression is that you learn to parse your precious energy out sparingly. Anything or anyone not worth it can jump off the next bridge.

That, plus the reduction of estrogen in Menopause allows you the power of no fucks left to give. Lol"

1136ip5,Hail Satan. Pass the grape juice.
1136ip5,All kids care about is a that you support them.  My mom never did.   I had panic attacks too.   They really suck.  Effexor helped me.  don‚Äôt be ashamed to get to a shrink.   I had to and still have to take meds.  I always will.  I am a nurse.   People are so crappy these days.  Hang in.   Your kids thanks you for giving a shit.
1136ip5,At least we have memories of what used to be!
1136ip5,I LOVE this idea
10z0h5x,Yay! Congrats! I‚Äôm down 20 pounds but my weight loss is from a messy breakup. 10/10 don‚Äôt recommend.
10z0h5x,Way to go!!!
10z0h5x,Yay for you!  I know it‚Äôs not easy!
10z0h5x,I'm jelly. But congrats! Yay you!
10z0h5x,Good for you!!!!!
10z0h5x,Yay go you!
10z0h5x,Way to go!!! I had lost 8 since Jan 2nd then slipped up and had 2 glasses of wine last weekend and gained 2 back. RRRRRGGGG
10z0h5x,"Hooray! I'm happy for you.

I'm still overweight but slowly taking off the pounds. My insomnia is better and my knees don't hurt now.  Lately, I've been trying to do things to add movement to my regular activity. It's a small thing to take two trips to the kitchen instead of carrying my plate and coffee cup in one go, but I feel like the little extra steps helps me."
10z0h5x,Congrats! Nice to see a positive post in this sub. I'm finding all the rants are starting to drive me away.
10z0h5x,Go pick up a 5 lb bag of potatoes and remind yourself how much weight that is and how well you‚Äôve done! Congrats üéâ
10z0h5x,"Keto always worked for me until the last few years of peri. The weight has shifted to my middle and just wasn‚Äôt budging. I‚Äôve been on hrt for a year and decided to give it another try. 10 lbs down in 30 days! Gonna see if I can shift 20 more, we‚Äôll see!"
10z0h5x,"Amazing. My husband kindly told me, I don‚Äôt understand, you don‚Äôt even eat that much. Lol time to eat better and make time for the gym. The physical exercise has benefits for the whole family (as in, I‚Äôm in a better mood!!)"
10z0h5x,Excellent!!! It is freaking HARD. Keep up the good work.
10z0h5x,Yay!!!
10z0h5x,Congratulations! ü•≥
10z0h5x,"Awesome!! I am on the same boat - after being asked if i‚Äôm pregnant, i got on keto and have been sticking with it since january 1st.
I‚Äôm down 8 pounds, and I don‚Äôt hate keto like I thought I would. üòÇ
It has its benefits like not feeling hungry all the time and I find it does help me focus better when i‚Äôm working."
10z0h5x,"I think I found them, they're on my hips, do you want them back."
10z0h5x,"A victory is a victory,  no matter how small it seems.  Congratulations, you're doing great!!"

10z0h5x,Wonderful!!!  Congrats to you!
10z0h5x,Five pounds is awesome!!!!   Keep up the awesome work!!
10z0h5x,Well done
10z0h5x,Good job!
10z0h5x,Thank you for sharing some positivity!
10z0h5x,"Good to know!!! I feel very disengaged from this sub lately with all the negative vents etc, but knowing that it is possible motivates me to ensure that when my time comes I take a healthier approach."
10z0h5x,I just wanted to add if you are looking for positive weight loss vibes pop in to the CICO sub. I didn't join but I pop in just lurk a bit. Granted it's not meno weight but there are so many folks making healthy positive changes in their lives. Good motivation.
10z0h5x,"Congrats! 

I joined a 10 week challenge at a local gym. I've been working out 6 days a week (5 days are a HIIT style class and 1 day is elliptical). I'm on a strict diet, low carb, low sugar, low cal. 

I'm on week 6. I've lost nothing. Not one ounce. 

I spent the past year doing little exercise and not really watching what I eat, so to suddenly start working out and eating well there should be a dramatic change. But nothing. What I'm doing now has always worked for me. I'm baffled.

Anyway, thank you for sharing. It gives me hope that maybe eventually I'll be able to shed a few lbs. I just need to keep trying and not give up."
10z0h5x,Congrats!!!!!  5lbs is fantastic. Happy for you.
10z0h5x,My husband and I want to each lose 10 pounds. You can just about guess who will be first. Congratulations!
10z0h5x,So happy for you. Thanks for sharing!!
10z0h5x,Good for you hun!!!
10z0h5x,Yay sounds amazing - I'm peri 48 & skipping periods for 2 years & workout often having trouble losing are u using weights or just cardio
10z0h5x,"Congratulations to you, small victories are big !!"
10z0h5x,Way to go! I just started exercising too and lost 2 pounds - you‚Äôre inspiring me to keep going! Peri-menopause is truly no joke!
10z0h5x," Congratulations! 
A positive incentive to keep going so thank you!"
10z0h5x,Congratulations. Five pounds is fantastic! Keep up what you are doing. I dropped 12 last year just by making small changes.
10z0h5x,Well done grrrl!!!
10z0h5x,That's fantastic üòÅ but did you have to send them my way *quietly putting away the family size bag of maltesers* üòÇ
10z0h5x,Congratulations‚Ä¶üéâüéäevery victory should be celebrated
10z0h5x,"Nice! That wouldn‚Äôt seem like much to a man, but as a fellow meno woman I am full of respect right now!!"
10z0h5x,I found it- on my scale this morning.
10z0h5x,Good for you. I‚Äôm peri menopause and lost 8 lbs. weight training and low glycemic diet. I‚Äôm in my ideal weight now. I‚Äôm gonna push hard to keep it that way.
10z0h5x,That's awesome proud of you!!!! I've never had problems with weight until now.. I did keto about 8 months ago and lost almost 30lbs so I stopped the diet like I did when I was younger after having my children to get rid of baby fat and it stayed gone...But it's like I instantly gained it back this time in a couple of months..I really don't understand My job itself is very physical I do heavy lifting and squats and a ton of walking so it really makes no since..I've had my thyroid checked and alot of bloodwork and it comes back good..I need to find a Dr that's for strictly hormones.
10z0h5x,I'm down 7. Whoop
10z0h5x,I hope a cyber hug is okay. Sorry about your breakup
10z0h5x,Thanks. Big hugs to you!
10z0h5x,Thank you so much!
10z0h5x,It‚Äôs definitely a struggle and the lbs aren‚Äôt flying off like they did when I was younger. Thank you!
10z0h5x,Damn. Wine shouldn't be so mean.
10z0h5x,"Wine does it to me too! I just reserve it for weekends and have forced myself to only have a couple of glasses (I used to do a lot more than that on occasion and my body won‚Äôt stand for it). But I think alcohol is very dehydrating and leads to water retention plus increased appetite and cravings for foods that are high in calories and salt etc. Your weight might go back down in a few days. I had a similar experience and think I lost a lot of water weight, then gained it back after a weekend of social activities that involved drinking and eating. It is nice to wake up and not feel bloated! Also not have puffiness around the eyes! That‚Äôs when I know I‚Äôve overdone it - the eyes always tell."

10z0h5x,Baby steps sounds like a healthy way to do it. I‚Äôm trying to make it a lifestyle change and not a crash diet. I don‚Äôt want to gain it all back.
10z0h5x,"I've been feeling the same about the rants and haven't been engaged as much. I think rants/vents need a safe space, maybe a sub of this sub?"
10z0h5x,"Yes, I just joined the other day and am considering leaving cuz it really gets me down. But this is nice. Good for you OP! 5 lbs is a lot these days. I remember being able to lose 5 lbs in a day or two if I wanted. Just by eating popcorn and drinking vodka and soda lol
Edit: word"
10z0h5x,Right? Five lbs is no small potatoes! üòÅ
10z0h5x,I love this! Thanks for that.
10z0h5x,Weight to the gym today after downloading the Caliber app for weights. Would love one buddy to check in with - any takers?
10z0h5x,"Same here. My belly got round, like it‚Äôs never been before. It‚Äôs so disheartening. Congrats on your weight loss!"
10z0h5x,Thank you!
10z0h5x,Ugh!! Any change as far as measurements‚Ä¶like maybe you‚Äôve gained muscle which is why the scale doesn‚Äôt reflect your efforts? This is my fear as I feel like nothing I‚Äôm doing is working so I‚Äôm constantly searching for the ‚Äòright‚Äô method as I‚Äôve never had issues losing weight through diet/exercise.
10z0h5x,"That's soooo frustrating! I give you lots of credit for trying to make a change by joining the challenge ... to see zero results for all your is just plain demoralizing. 

I'd like to share that for many of us in the age of menopause, LOTS of exercise can bite us in the butt (especially when paired with a restrictive diet). Our bodies read that as stress (because we don't have the estrogen to manage cortisol like we used to), and chronic stress (aka chronically high cortisol levels) tends to lead to fat storage, particularly in the belly area. 

For many, what works better is a CONSISTENT more moderate approach (consistency is the key), both in terms of exercise and diet. Oh, and focus on strength training in the gym, as opposed to cardio. It's going to give you the results you seek, in terms of fat loss. 

Good luck to you! And yes - don't give up! üôÇ"
10z0h5x,How low are your calories? Did you go too low?
10z0h5x,"I‚Äôm doing 30 minutes of weights 3 times a week. Cardio 6 days per week. 

Also, looking at my portion size for meals. I‚Äôm increasing my fruits and veggies, while decreasing the unhealthy carbs. Also drinking a lot of water.

Thank you!"
10z0h5x,Thanks! My goal is to lose 15 lbs and keep it off. I just want to be healthier over all.
10z0h5x,All booze is mean now. It hates me
10z0h5x,Thankfully yes it did go back down but it took all damn week. Now I have a first date tonight and not sure how to handle the booze aspect
10z0h5x,"That would be great. I reluctantly left this sub after I made my comment, when the next post was someone bashing her husband. I get the relief at finding a group who can relate to your experiences and struggles but the constant bitching is a far cry from the supportive, informative forum this group seemed to be at first. It's draining to me, so I've left for now. Kinda sad about it though."
10z0h5x,Oh my gosh me too! I was hoping for camaraderie but also positivity with maybe an occasional vent. Perhaps more of a we can do this vibe with suggestions. I would never want my daughter to read this. It seems like mostly horror stories. Could be quite frightening if this is the only place someone stumbled upon for support. Maybe there could be a secondary sub for great suggestions and success for those who need that too.
10z0h5x,"Yeah, this gym is good in that it balances both cardio and weight training and keeps me consistent. Which only adds to the frustration Because I know I'm doing all the right things, to no avail. I actually prefer weight training to cardio, so that's always been a bit more of my focus. I feel like my arms are more tone, but the belly bulge ain't budging. And the thing is, I am a smaller sized person so when I try to discuss losing weight I get the whole ""but you don't need to lose weight"" comments and my concerns are dismissed. My feeling is, I would like to lose the 8 lbs I gained this past year. I want my pants to fit better. That's all. And yeah, I know I will be fine if I stay this size, but my concern is the 'why'. Why isn't this working? If I can't lose weight, what do I do if I keep gaining? I'm try to nip a root cause in the bud, so it's frustrating to be dismissed because 'I don't need to lose weight'. I've also developed acne rosacea and while my doc wanted to be helpful in treating that, she had no interest in hearing me whine about my weight. 

I need to figure out a way to keep doing what I'm doing without reaching the 'screw it, why bother' breaking point. Cause it would be very easy to stop going to fitness classes at 7am every damn day. 

Thanks for your thoughts!"
10z0h5x,This is what I was trying to get at with my above question about calories. HITT classes may not be the answer. Walking and lifting weights seems to be highly successful for many people without raising cortisol levels.
10z0h5x,"I don't think so because I try to zigzag a bit. My Fitness Pal has me at 1200 for a lb a week loss (loss so far, zero). Calories get added based on workouts. So if I burn a few hundred calories I can have around 1500. Sometimes I'm under, sometimes I'm over. I allow myself to go over a bit more on weekends while sticking to the low carb/sugar part. 

Less than two years ago I lost almost 20 lbs doing everything that I am doing now. This has never not worked for me. And it's hard when one person is like, you need to eat more calories, and the next person is telling me I'm not cutting enough or need to fast (I just don't think I can fast, no way). It's a lot of confusing and conflicting info, and my concern it's a hormonal issue that isn't going to be conquered by minor tweeks in diet or exercise. 

I might try cutting back even more this week just to see if it makes any difference."
10z0h5x,Don't be afraid to lift heavier weights too. You won't get bulky. It's the only thing that will change the shape of your body.
10z0h5x,I know. It doesn't treat me like it used to. I saw Jane Fonda recently on TV saying that half a martini (or whatever she drinks) knocks her out now. So she stopped because she doesn't want to be hung over when she passes.üò≥
10z0h5x,I know what you mean. I have date nights with my boyfriend on the weekends and we do have drinks. I‚Äôve had to accept this as a trade-off but cutting way down (one or two instead of 3 to 5) has helped me. I‚Äôm not ready to give up wine and have also been hydrating a lot more - I used to not pay attention to how much water I drank but now targeting half my weight (in pounds) as ounces of water each day. This is just a little over the classic 8 glasses a day‚Ä¶I think it helps a lot. Enjoy your date!!! Hope all goes well!
10z0h5x,Good luck on your date tonight!
10z0h5x,Yes. I agree. I think I‚Äôm peri. I‚Äôm 47. I have an IUD that makes it hard to track my cycle but last September I definitely experienced some hot flashing. There was no mistaking it. I came here to maybe get some useful tips and stuff. Instead it‚Äôs making me paranoid about this change. I think I need to bounce.
10z0h5x,Agree.
10z0h5x,"100%! 

In the 90s we were told by the experts to do lots and LOTS of cardio to help manage our weight. When I was in my 20s & 30s, used to spend HOURS in aerobic classes and on treadmills and elliptical machines (AND I lifted weights). I was in the gym 6-7 days a week. 

That‚Äôs too much physical stress for most menopausal bodies (= chronically high cortisol = belly fat/ increased hunger & cravings/low energy). 

 The recommendation is 3-4 short (20-30 minutes), intense weight-based workouts per week and lots and lots (and LOTS) of leisure walking or restorative yoga or whatever cools your jets."
10z0h5x,I'm not an expert but EVERYTHING I've read says you should never go below 1200.

10z0h5x,I am 49 and just now have had some missed periods. I think I has some warm flushes in the past. Literally horrified as to what might be ahead being here but I know that is actually not always the case. Not sure why I would stay to increase the potential anxiety that is coming for me!?! üòÇ If I was mores reddit savvy I would create  the sub myself.
10z0h5x,"Yeah, normally I wouldn't do that because it makes it way worse when you start eating again, but am feeling desperate to see if I can break this plateau. 

Truth be told, not sure I can actually go a whole week eating less than 1200, but I need to try something different."
10z0h5x,It sounds like you are taking good care of yourself! Hope you enjoy Mardi Gras and have a good week ahead!
10z0h5x,Aw. Are you ok with that? Disappointed?
10z0h5x,How many calories were you eating before you started tracking?
10z0h5x,Pretty disappointed yeah. Trying to temper my reaction.
10z0h5x,"Honestly, depended on the day, but prob 2000-3000 on average?"
10z0h5x,Obviously all the numbers bmr etc tdee depend on your current height weight age and activity level. I don't know what you are doing for exercise but I maybe adjust your macros on MFP or add in more low stress cardio like walking and not drop your calories any more.
10z0h5x,Ahh yes. You mentioned HIIT classes. Someone else mentioned the cortisol spikes. Maybe try doing 2 of those a week and getting on the treadmill or walking outside.
10z0h5x,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to spring when I can walk more. I miss just walking. 

I guess I'll just finish the challenge (4 more weeks) and do some research and readjust my workouts after. To me, from a biological standpoint, working out 5-6 times a week and eating well should just equal weight loss. Like, I don't understand how it can't so I'm driving myself crazy. 

Thanks for your thoughts and advice."

10qtzhs,"""The biggest takeaway from the last two decades of research is that age matters: For women who go through early menopause, before age 45, hormone therapy is recommended because they‚Äôre at greater risk for osteoporosis if they don‚Äôt receive hormones up until the typical age of menopause. For healthy women in their 50s, life-threatening events like clots or stroke are rare, and so the increased risks from hormone therapy are also quite low. When Manson, along with Rossouw, did a reanalysis of the W.H.I. findings, she found that women under 60 in the trial had no elevated risk of heart disease."""

I did the estrogen/progesterone combi for a while 5 years ago to address extremely painful periods and PMDD. Then they found out I likely had adhesions, and I had them operated out.

Then I stopped the hormones, since the pain was better.

Since then the pandemic has hit, I've discovered I'm autistic (hence the extreme interpersonal and emotional difficulties premenstrually). When I was on hormones, I felt I could understand other people more, but I also became much more fearful and had lower energy.

I'm 50 now and apparently in perimenopause; wondering if I could or should do hormones again? The dry skin, muscle pain, insomnia and just generally feeling ""blah"" most of the time sucks.

10qtzhs,"What an excellent article. A lot of it I learned from menopause Taylor. But it was a good reminder of the self talk that we engage in when talking to doctors, etc and about how much we endure. The IUD has side effects too btw. 3-6-12 mos of side effects. I am on month 8 and went in to have it removed. I can‚Äôt wear pants anymore due to soreness down there. Lots of bleeding in the first 5 mos, daily bleeding.  After my chat w doctor, we decided to stay on it as perhaps I have gotten over the hump of the side effects. 

The mental stuff is tough too. Is my depression coming from an awareness of my mortality, seeing my last phase in life now happening.  I seem to fight that with daily fitness activities that keep me moving and make me feel like, no, am not dying, still alive and running. Any physical set back makes me anxious. A very painful UTI made me so sad. Will I recover from this injury/condition? Will I endure and make it or die like Lisa Marie just did, too young and unable to endure it all."

Imagine that many of them suddenly found sex to be painful, that they were newly prone to urinary-tract infections, with their penises becoming dry and irritable, even showing signs of what their doctors called ‚Äúatrophy.‚Äù Imagine that many of their doctors had received little to no training on how to manage these symptoms ‚Äî and when the subject arose, sometimes reassured their patients that this process was natural, as if that should be consolation enough.*

>**Within six months, insurance claims for hormone therapy had dropped by 30 percent, and by 2009, they were down by more than 70 percent.**

This. This right here. This is all you need to know. It's about saving money. Insurance companies have so much money to ""fund"" research. They will throw their pocket change toward any research that saves them money in the long run. They look at their budgets and they try to find ways to cut corners.

Insurance companies: ""So which will we axe? HRT or Insulin?""

Also insurance companies: ""Both!!""

*""Sorry, ma'am, we're not covering your fancy HRT. That's just some extra, fancy privileged flowery fluff medicine that you don't need to stay alive. Look, we paid for the research to prove it. In fact IT WILL KILL YOU.""* lol jfc.

Ok, so, is it just me or does anyone else feel like **the obgyn office is just super baby-centric** (aka focused on younger women) and if you're either childfree or just an older woman... you're basically shit on a stick? I feel like the obgyn is just there to facilitate breeding and that's all. I know some people have told me there are just ""gyn"" offices without the ob and I personally have never ever found any of those in my region. Every women's health doctor is an **ob**gyn where I live. The waiting room is just full of pregnant folks and my issues seem to always take a backseat. Like when I had a torsed ovary and needed emergency surgery, my obgyn didn't feel like doing it, so he made me wait until the following Monday (I went in to the ER on a Wed) to get the surgery. And he didn't even do my surgery. He passed it off to a colleague. This is a doctor who drops everything to go deliver babies, **but he wasn't there for me.** (Yes, I fired this guy. No worries.) Also, over that weekend prior to unilateral oophorectomy, I was in so much pain that my husband called the doctor on his exchange number. Apparently he yelled at my husband for bothering him and told him to tell me to take some pain medication and deal with it until the surgery date. My husband was so disturbed that the doctor spoke to him that way. My ovary was literally torsed and necrotic inside of me for 6 days. 

Babies, babies, babies -- that's all we're good for. (And I didn't even have any, so I'm really a huge waste of their time.)"

10qtzhs,"Just read this article this morning and came to the sub to see if it had been posted.

I cut and pasted so many good (and some quite sad) quotes from this article today in my notes. Here were a few nuggets that stuck out for me (besides the larger pieces that have already been posted). 

*‚ÄôMenopause has the worst P.R. campaign in the history of the universe, because it‚Äôs not just hot flashes and night sweats.‚Äô*

*‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt suggests that we have a high cultural tolerance for women‚Äôs suffering,‚Äù Thurston says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not regarded as important.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùNonetheless,‚Äù Bluming and his co-author, Carol Tavris, write in ‚ÄúEstrogen Matters,‚Äù ‚Äúwe have yet to see an N.I.H. press conference convened to reassure women of the benefits of estrogen.‚Äù Anything short of that, they argue, allows misrepresentations and fears to persist.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùBut the field of gynecology will, most likely for decades to come, be populated by many doctors who left medical school unprepared to offer guidance to menopausal women who need their help.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùMenopause could represent a time when women feel maximum control of our bodies, free at last from the risk of being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy. And yet for many women, *menopause becomes a new struggle to control our bodies, not because of legislation or religion but because of a lack of knowledge on our part, and also on the part of our doctors.* Menopause presents not just a new stage of life but also a state of confusion. At a time when we have the right to feel seasoned, women are thrust into the role of newbie, *or worse, medical detective*, in charge of solving our own problems.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùThere hasn‚Äôt been a single randomized trial of hormone therapy for women in perimenopause,‚Äù Maki says. ‚ÄúEgregious, right?‚Äù*

I sent this article to my friend who recently went through menopause and was never offered HRT. Instead she spent over two years in therapy trying to ‚Äúfigure out what was wrong with her‚Äù and was put on antidepressants. She said she felt ‚Äúdumbed down‚Äù by the ‚Äúwhole system‚Äù and is ‚Äújust numb‚Äù.  I am amazed that this smart, talented woman got rolled over by Dr‚Äôs and is now kind of a shadow of herself."

My naturopathic Dr said most people get plenty (ie unwanted) estrogen in in meat, milk...even trace amounts in plastics and other things. Testosterone gets converted into estrogen as well (how much, no idea, not a Dr!) 
I've tried full BHRT and just testosterone (and higher mg) and I'm sticking w testosterone.
And of course in the US, Medicaid and Medicare cover male testosterone but as said above, women who want hormones are just emotional or vain."
10qtzhs,"Does anyone have experience using MIDI health? I might start a separate post on this topic to make sure I reach more subscribers. But I‚Äôm curious to know if anybody has experience with the menopause specific providers listed in the article. Midi Health, Evernow and Alloy."
10qtzhs,"I've been getting numbed to fuck on antidepressants for four years by my docs.

10qtzhs,Thank you!
10qtzhs,"My (new) gynecologist laughed when I told her that I will never stop using estradiol patches.

I DO have a genetic clotting risk. Before I started on HRT I had a consult with a hematologist to review/discuss my risk factors.  He said ‚Äúno oral estrogen, that‚Äôs where the danger is for those with the DVT risk factors.  Patches are fine. Gave me a list of other preventative steps to take. 

Now I‚Äôm up to the .075 Mylan patch 1x a week (they‚Äôre hideous and huge, but work).  I feel soooo much better. Less rage, no hot flashes (unless I overdo it on alcohol), clearer thoughts.

Seriously I can‚Äôt imagine going without my patch. I‚Äôd probably have to retire."
10qtzhs,"At 55 and only in full meno for 18 months, I havent had much in the way of hot flashes so I never thought much about HRT.

10qtzhs,"It's ridiculous that you had to jump through so many hoops to try to find a care professional with a clue. From the article -- how fast would the medical establishment figure it out if it were men who went through this?

>Imagine that some significant portion of the male population started regularly waking in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, a problem that endured for several years. Imagine that those men stumbled to work, exhausted, their morale low, frequently tearing off their jackets or hoodies during meetings and excusing themselves to gulp for air by a window. Imagine that many of them suddenly found sex to be painful, that they were newly prone to urinary-tract infections, with their penises becoming dry and irritable, even showing signs of what their doctors called ‚Äúatrophy.‚Äù Imagine that many of their doctors had received little to no training on how to manage these symptoms ‚Äî and when the subject arose, sometimes reassured their patients that this process was natural,as if that should be consolation enough."
10qtzhs,"Oh man, I'm so sorry. It's crazy they will hand out bc like candy, but hrt? Nooo. Made it make sense!! I had to find a different doctor to finally get help. I didn't tolerate estradiol well (increase anxiety), so bc was a nightmare for me, but premarin works like a dream. I have to pay out of pocket for it because insurance only wants to cover generic estradiol, which I find very frustrating, but at least I can get my medication. I just know if I was a man and needed test, it would be no issue, and it PISSES ME OFF.  The older I get the more bitter I am about medical inequality for women. I'm glad you finally got some relief."

10qtzhs,"I started menopause prematurely too! Diagnosed by the most wonderful OB last year, after nearly a decade of ever worsening symptoms. I'm 38 now. This is on top of Fibromyalgia and Sjogren's. It's fucking exhausting to be honest. We've been using BC which has been working til the last few months, trying a new pill and got a referral for a dexa scan and dietitian to help me maneuver my new metabolism.

10qtzhs,"I found out where to order it, and progesterone, online, in case anything happens to my doctor or politically."
10qtzhs,"Sometimes you just have to take a different route to get your needs met! I went through at least six different practitioners over the course of a year or more before I finally found an ‚Äúestrogen positive‚Äù Dr. (which quite frankly I honestly never thought I would find). It‚Äôs still ‚Äúnot perfect‚Äù, but so much better and I can manage that."
10qtzhs,"Hi, Snoo. I‚Äôm from SE Asia and usually a silent reader on Reddit. Turning 52 late this year. Just wanna extend my heartfelt appreciation for your sharing. I‚Äôm this area of the globe, women don‚Äôt talk about a lot of stuff and I feel even the doctors, the gynecologists even, aren‚Äôt aware of these topics. 50F friend told me she doesn‚Äôt think much about it because it‚Äôs a natural part of aging. She also insists my symptoms are because of my diet (lol My sugar, dairy, and processed foods intake has dramatically decreased in the past 15 years, but she consumes Oreo and bacon almost every day. I don‚Äôt resent her but it‚Äôs just that maybe her genes aren‚Äôt predisposed to the symptoms ‚Äî yet?). The gynecologist last year dismissed my suggestion that I might be feeling anxiety or panic attacks due to entering perimenopause or hormonal imbalances. I‚Äôm desperately trying to understand my moods and body changes, I told her, and all she said was anxiety affected only 4 of her patients. She avoided discussing my topic eventually. I pay for sessions with doctors and I feel shortchanged by their lack of empathy (female doctors even) and perhaps knowledge. I tried asking women here in their 60s but all they said was it‚Äôs normal and natural and couldn‚Äôt remember any symptoms or said they had none. I‚Äôm of mixed ancestry (one grandparent was from Europe; another from upper Asia) so now I‚Äôm thinking maybe my symptoms are similar to western women because of genes? I feel so lost and alone and this link you shared, this thread here in Reddit, is helping me so much. Online articles like these are my sources of self-help. 

THANK YOU."
10qtzhs,Thanks Snoo! I didn't know that was an option - I'm going to have to figure out how to do that.

10qtzhs,"""The findings, however, did reveal greater risks for women who start hormone therapy after age 60. Manson‚Äôs analyses found that women had a small elevated risk of coronary heart disease if they started taking hormones after age 60 and a significant elevated risk if they started after age 70. It was possible, researchers have hypothesized, that hormones may be most effective within a certain window, perpetuating the well-being of systems that are still healthy but accelerating damage in those already in decline. (No research has yet followed women who start in their 50s and stay on continuously into their 60s.)

Researchers also now have a better appreciation of the benefits of hormone therapy. Even at the time that the W.H.I. findings were released, the data showed at least one clear improvement resulting from hormone therapy: Women had 24 percent fewer fractures. Since then, other positive results have emerged. The incidence of diabetes, for instance, was found to be 20 percent lower in women who took hormones, compared with those who took a placebo. In the W.H.I. trial, women who had hysterectomies ‚Äî 30 percent of American women by age 60 ‚Äî were given estrogen alone because they did not need progesterone to protect them from endometrial cancer, and that group had lower rates of breast cancer than the placebo group. ‚ÄúNonetheless,‚Äù Bluming and his co-author, Carol Tavris, write in ‚ÄúEstrogen Matters,‚Äù ‚Äúwe have yet to see an N.I.H. press conference convened to reassure women of the benefits of estrogen.‚Äù Anything short of that, they argue, allows misrepresentations and fears to persist."""
10qtzhs,"This makes me so mad. I went through it at 44 and hrt was never even mentioned to me until I brought it up 4 years later, and now my dr is still hemming and hawing about whether to give it to me."

Sounds more like you need a new gynecologist. üòî"
10qtzhs,"I found with my primary care (more than one) for 2 years as I felt like I was dying from sleep deprivation. I was also told it was ‚Äúin my head‚Äù
I am on progesterone now and have slept every single night since the first night I took it. I got my life back."
10qtzhs,I had a similar disagreement with my GP about progesterone for sleep. I found several PubMed articles linking progesterone to better sleep and sent them to him and asked for a trial of progesterone. He agreed. I slept like the dead from the first night I took it.
10qtzhs,Yeah I was told to do mindfulness exercises because my ‚Äúbrain seems always on‚Äù after trying to explain my entire history in a 10 minute appointment with the 4th doctor at the same surgery.
10qtzhs,I'm an APRN and menopause is absolutely linked with insomnia.  What nonsense. I'd fire them and find another doc who's more in tune with your needs.
10qtzhs,"Omg, the ignorance is stunning. Insomnia is what I credit for the worst anxiety and depression I've ever experienced. I slept well my whole damn life before age 49. SMH."
10qtzhs,Just curious if your gyno is young?
10qtzhs,"It‚Äôs much easier to remove organs than to admit they really don‚Äôt know what causes some women to be symptomatic and others not to be or how to manage it without causing a host of side effects. No worries, just rip out the old pieces, what could go wrong. /s"
10qtzhs,"Which is funny, because pre menopause they‚Äòd never dare touch your uterus, because what about your imaginary future husband? Maybe he‚Äòll want to have kids?

And once you are not fertile anymore, suddenly they‚Äòll run in your door trying to remove it.


I wonder if there‚Äòs some ulterior motives there."
10qtzhs,Agreed!  I had fibroids and had to fight with my doctor for any other treatment aside from a hysterectomy due to my age.  I just had an appointment yesterday about an ovary issue and she made an unnecessary comment about how my fibroids were still there since I went with an embolization instead of a hysterectomy.  I again reminded her that the symptoms I had experienced went away after the embolization so I was still glad I went that route.  I couldn‚Äôt believe at the time how negative she was about any options other than a hysterectomy.  Embolization is so much simpler and a much easier recovery than abdominal surgery.  I know because I‚Äôve had abdominal surgery to remove fibroids 20 years ago and this was a walk in a park compared to that.
10qtzhs,That seemed weirdly high to me too- I almost wonder if that is an error.
10qtzhs,"It‚Äôs interesting because when I had debilitating periods my dr gave me the option of an ablation or a hysterectomy‚Äîhe said the ablation may or may not fix the problem and I may need a hysterectomy after. Obviously I chose ablation, which worked like a champ, but there wasn‚Äôt any encouragement to at least try the ablation first."
10qtzhs,"That was my reaction, too."
10qtzhs,"It is extreme, I mean if one has cancer, yes for heavens sake have it removed if that's what the doctor's say.  But many cases are nothing severe like that."
10qtzhs,"Testosterone gets completely ignored in menopause be abuse I think it‚Äòs only known as the male sex hormone.


Which is unfortunate, because every human of any sex has, and needs all sex hormones to feel their best. The only difference is which of estrogen and testosterone has the higher effective blood levels.



It‚Äòs also quite terrible that it gets this much neglected for people with hormone sensitive breast cancer. They get put on Aromatase Inhibitors. And then just told well cope with your symptoms, or stop the drug and risk dying. Your choice.

When in reality there‚Äòs another option: adding testosterone into the mix. Testosterone alone can relieve most menopause symptoms apart from genital specific ones (which can be treated with local estriol even with HR+ BC).
And the best part? There‚Äôs already been massive studies done about this. Like people being given the AI and a freaking testosterone implant. And they had better outcome at the breast cancer part, as well as improved Quality of life.





As to your question: in peri menopause you can only tell whether you ‚Äöreally‚Äò are in it by starting HRT; estrogen and FSH likely won‚Äòt be too low or high respectively to definetely register as heading for menopause.


Additionally, was your HRT actual progesterone, or just a gestagen? While their primary effects are the same, progesterone massively reduces anxiety and improves sleep, when those are caused by a lack of progesterone production.


Best think you can do is talk to an experienced (or willing to get into the research) GP or OBGYN and have them prescribe HRT, and if low energy remains, have them give you testosterone as well. Alternatively just using testosterone might be on option. Depending on where you live female strength prescriptions are likely not available though, only through compounding pharmacies. Or by using testosterone gel for men, the kind that comes in bags, and splitting a single day dose bag over 7 to 10 days. 


If your physician of choice doesn‚Äòt know about estradiol and progesterone only HRT (rather than the synthetic estrogens/gestagen ones) and that women in menopause can and will lack testosterone, and is not willing to educate themself, you might want to see someone else for a 2nd and 3rd opinion though."
10qtzhs,I always tell people that doctors are a dime a dozen. Fire them. There will always be another doctor.
10qtzhs,But it's not covered by most insurance. Mine said I had to have severe blood level depletion such that it was a necessary medical treatment.
10qtzhs,"I‚Äôm curious if anyone knows how to get to a Dr that will prescribe HRT if your insurance is Kaiser? Kaiser themselves won‚Äôt consider prescribing it until you are totally through Menopause, so us in perimenopause just have to wait years in misery. I can‚Äôt switch insurance right now so I‚Äôm not sure what to do‚Ä¶"

10qtzhs,"I fired mine without benefit of a new one in line & have been much better using bio-id's. I'm only casually looking, figuring they're all the same."
10qtzhs,"The tide is slowly changing. If more women demand it, it will change."
10qtzhs,"Yes, proper modern HRT is being given literal estrogen, the same our bodies naturally produce. Either as free estradiol or as an ester (which slowly releases estradiol over time, the ester itself doesn‚Äòt have any effect) plus actual progesterone (especially when you still have a uterus).


However there‚Äòs loads of bullshit HRT out there using derivatives of estrogen and Gestagens, fully synthetic drugs that mimic the effect of human estradiol and progesterone.

It‚Äòs just that for example, actual progesterone gets converted to neurosteroids in the body, which help with sleep and anxiety. Synthetic Gestagens get converted to completely different molecules. So a synthetic gestagen cannot compensate for a lack of progesterone.

Premarin for example is horse estrogens (extracted from pregnant mare urine, bit that‚Äòs the harmless part), thing is premarine is absolutely zero estradiol, that is real human estrogen. It‚Äòs what horses turn estradiol into and what they use during pregnancy.

Hence all the negative research coming out: Premarin isn‚Äòt better than taking any random hormonal birth control pill.


And most importantly why give a different drug, when the exact cause of the symptoms is known? A lack of estradiol and progesterone.

And we can easily apply the exact correct molecules.



This is like so weird, it‚Äòs like these products get made in search for a problem, when the solution is just there. And already available.





Additionally testosterone also often gets completely ignored.


While yea estrogen is the female sex hormone; and testosterone is the male sex hormone, that‚Äòs just the sexes in which the hormone is more dominant.

Everyone has all three of the hormones. And in menopause the levels of all three drop. Meaning if regular estrogen+progesterone HRT does not fully alleviate symptoms. Adding testosterone at the appropriate female dose should be the very next step.


Before trying random anti depressants and stuff.



Additionally for people who cannot take Estrogen/Progesterone HRT because of hormone sensitive breast cancer: Testosterone is still an option for HRT.

And especially in people with hormone sensitive breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors (which put you in full blown chemical menopause) testosterone has massive benefits for overall well-being. And there‚Äôs quite a few, even old, studies showing the combination of testosterone with aromatase inhibitors works perfectly well, in some studies even reducing reoccurrence rates.

(Because testosterone itself has breast tissue anti growth effects)

Additionally if menopause symptoms are too severe, testosterone can even be dosed to higher than normal levels, there will be a risk of permanent physical or rather cosmetic changes though




But yes. HRT normally means taking just estrogen and progesterone. Because the lack of those two hormones is what causes menopause symptoms in the first place. The lack of these hormones is caused by the ovaries saying ‚Äöfuck it I‚Äôm done‚Äò and not reacting appropriately to the hormone LSH that tells them to start producing more.

Put estrogen and progesterone back into the blood stream, and everything continues working as before. Well unless you run without estrogen and progesterone for too long, then suddenly adding them back in has the risks mentioned in the article."
10qtzhs,"It‚Äôs more than just taking estrogen. HRT is usually an estrogen patch and either an oral progesterone or an IUD with progesterone. Many women use a topical vaginal estrogen cream or suppository, in addition. And lots of women use a testosterone cream or gel."
10qtzhs,[deleted]
10qtzhs,"I agree 100%. Also, going to a GYN only is no guarantee of better care.  I specifically went out of my way to get a gynecologist that did not deliver babies. She is also on the NAMS list. She told me I could not do HRT until I stopped menstruation. So, after crying in my car on the way home, I fired that heifer and contacted Evernow. Got on the HRT and 70% of my symptoms disappeared.  Paid for that for 3 months and went to my primary doctor. She listened, though, she also acted totally clueless on dosage and current trends. She did prescribe what evernow prescribed so now it is covered by my insurance.   She refused to add testosterone and evernow doesn‚Äôt offer it either.  In my next appointment, I am asking for vaginal estrogen as well. It is maddening to me that I have to fight for proper healthcare. I am also on the hunt for a new GYN.  Good luck out there. I figure we are the first generation demanding this shit gets addressed so we hopefully can make it better for the young women coming into this after us."
10qtzhs,"Well if anything...be the woman who whips this out in their Doctor if they refuse to prescribe it to you. Seriously, tell them if you were a man they would treat your symptoms differently and actually care about your outcome. Fuck Doctors who refuse to prescribe HRT to healthy women who can take it."
10qtzhs,"I think you may be on to something with the money thing‚Ä¶only maybe we can flip that narrative by showing the Pharma bros that us women will pay a LOT of money for relief from menopause. If they see money can be made, they‚Äôll make the drugs and hire the lobbyists to get the drugs approved on formularies. So how do we show/communicate to them we have the money and the desire to spend it for relief?"
10qtzhs,"Rawdogging menopause is a bitch for us !!! I‚Äôve been seeing that vaginal hormone cream might be ok though recently, I‚Äôm asking at my next appointment in a week because it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. Gabapentin has helped with my hot flashes tremendously though! I only take it before bed."
10qtzhs,"If you weren‚Äòt given progesterone but a different gestagen (or no gestagen) in your HRT regimen, you might want to try again, which progesterone. Actual progesterone reduces anxiety and insomnia, synthetic Gestagens do not touch it. And estrogen itself can make anxiety worse."

10qtzhs,"I don't understand the difference (risk-wise) between hrt and bc. 

I'm convinced they gatekeep hrt to save money. Birth control is likely cheaper. Beyond that, now there's an uptick in the demand for hrt for gender reassignment and a lot more laws are being put into effect to block access to it. I'm convinced that gatekeeping hrt for trans folks will also somehow bleed over onto cis women who need it too. And insurance companies will back this. They don't want to cover any of the claims.

10qtzhs,"I really dislike this blaming women for their diets in menopause thing.  Yes it's good to strive to eat healthy food, of course, but it's a hormonal shift, it's not caused by food.  I think this is just causing women to blame themselves for not being perfect ""oh I ate one hershey's kiss yesterday, that must be why I have menopause symptoms"".  Uh, it's much more likely to be hormones soaring and crashing."
10qtzhs,You're welcome!
10qtzhs,"I began having HORRIFIC panic attacks and  lots of anxiety too.  My functional doc has me taking a natural form of estrogen and it is really helping.  From what I have read low estrogen can definitely trigger panic attacks!

10qtzhs,I went through menopause at 44 too and didn‚Äôt learn about the importance of estrogen until 48 (from menopause groups online like this one). I found a new doc who said I lack estrogen and promptly put me on low dose BC. I feel so much better. Maybe ask to be put on the pill?

10qtzhs,"WTF? That‚Äôs basic medical knowledge. Progesterone gets metabolized to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopregnanolone

No progesterone, no allopregnanolone. That‚Äòs like what? 101 human biochemistry.


How the heck do these people become GPS or even obgyns without even knowing the human sex hormones outside of the three pop sci ones.


That‚Äòs also why just being given a random birth control pill (which are all btw contra indicated over 35 due to clotting risks of the synthetic estrogen and gestagen combo) makes no difference on sleep.

Gestagens have their own random metabolites depending on chemical structure. Sure the levonorgestrel itself has pretty similar effects to progesterone. But it does nothing to fix the lack of allopregnanolone.


Like neurosteroids get used for literal general anesthesia in veterinary medicine. That‚Äòs how potent they can be.



And there‚Äòs physician going around saying progesterone can‚Äòt help with sleep? The heck? Even in line half of people with no trouble falling asleep or getting through the night, progesterone will have a noticeable effect."
10qtzhs,Yes.  She is a resident and consults with her attending on everything.  I have never met the attending so can‚Äôt say if they are also young.  I had an elderly gyno previously who dismissed all of my symptoms except hot flashes and I fired her.
10qtzhs,SO TRUE!!
10qtzhs,"He's not totally wrong. Ablation is weird. My sister had an ablation at 39 and it was great until her mid to late 40's. Then she started having sporadic breakthrough bleeding again.

The same thing happened to my friend's wife. What was really spooky about that one was that he was chatting with me and suggested I get an ablation for my menstrual issues, citing that it'd been working great for his wife over the course of 5 years. (This was before my hysterectomy... which I had to have because I had a 1 lb tumor. Which is what caused the menstrual issues in my case.)

I told him, ""Nah. It didn't work out for my older sister."" He kind of debated with me and the conversation ended. Then! At the end of the week, he immediately messaged me and said, ""You weren't kidding! She just started having breakthrough bleeding last night. Never happened before."" We both thought the timing was eerie.

I mean, so, ablation can fail, but from the two incidents I witnessed... it takes years.

Also that all being said... no one should EVER get a hysterectomy to circumvent menstrual issues unless it is their absolute last resort and they are bleeding so much that they cannot walk.  I had a hysterectomy, but still have a left ovary, and uhhhhh no. Just no. NO.

Want to know how I lost my perfectly healthy right ovary?

Scar tissue **from the hysterectomy** torsed and destroyed it a year after the initial surgery."

I have Blue Cross Blue Shield and I still pay every penny out of pocket since I have a health plan where everything is subject to my deductible.  

Try to find a NP, PA, or doctor who works at one of your local community clinics or get a referral from one of your friends. Call up said clinic and explain you are ""cash pay"". This often equals a discounted price for an initial visit.
Do some research before hand and figure out what meds you want to try (combipatch, estrogen only, progesterone only, whatever your situation is) and have them write you a hard script. Take that hard script and shop around for the best price (GoodRX, local Wal-Mart, Canada, etc).

It absolutely sucks that you have to go outside of Kaiser but do what you have to do to be an advocate for yourself. 

I have found that if you can do some research beforehand and go to your doctor with solutions you'd like to try, you can find a doctor who will write you a script.

I went to my local community clinic and told the NP ""hey I've been doing a lot of research and I'd like to try Combipatch"". We discussed my medical history/ situation and boom, she gave me a hard script without jumping through any hoops. I found cheaper meds through a Canadian pharmacy and started 2 weeks ago. My
Insurance has covered nothing. 

If you can get yourself on a regimen of meds, then sometime in the future you can then go back to your Kaiser doctor and let them know you have been on HRT, it's working and can they refill. Good luck sister!!"
10qtzhs,Use this [lookup](https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx) to find a NAMS NCMP.
10qtzhs,I feel like us riot grrl/gen x women are gonna be the ones to push for this!
10qtzhs,This is an amazingly detailed response! Thank you for taking the time!
10qtzhs,"Super informative, TY. What is an average testosterone dose for women?"
10qtzhs,"I saw Estradiol in the pharmacy today, but I can't imagine it's high-quality if you can buy it at Walgreen's."
10qtzhs,"So are you saying that ‚Äúliteral estrogen, the same our bodies naturally produce‚Äù  and ‚Äúliteral progesterone‚Äù is a thing that is better than what is in synthetic prescription HRT and synthetic prescription birth control?"
10qtzhs,Thank you. I‚Äôm going through IVF but I feel like I‚Äôve been in periomenopause for awhile. When I asked my doctors they said that I wasn‚Äôt in peri. But when I started taking estrogen for the ivf I‚Äôve started to feel better. After I‚Äôm done with ivf (pregnancy or none) I want to be proactive about pursuing HRT and a doctor who is well-versed in menopause
10qtzhs,"Yes, it's my understanding that the main breast cancer risk of HRT is when estrogen supplements are unchecked with a complementary progesterone supplement, so I'd think that at the very least those two are necessary.  I've also read that transdermal/patch progesterone is not absorbed properly, so progesterone needs to be taken by other delivery method (oral or IUD as you mentioned)."
10qtzhs,"Even without a uterus, progesterone is highly adviseable because it also affects many of the symptoms of menopause. Most importantly anxiety and insomnia."
10qtzhs,Yes.
10qtzhs,Good for you!!! and I agree that the NAMS list is no guarantee of good care. Unfortunately. But I do think it‚Äôs a better starting point. One still may have to do more searching and advocating for themselves.
10qtzhs,"The goal isn't to get pharmaceutical companies to exploit women's desperation, though. They do that with life saving AIDS and diabetes medicine. They don't care if people don't have insurance. 

Women are willing to pay.... but many women live in poverty, especially women of color. So... we don't want to make pharmaceutical companies think, ""Oh, the well off, privileged white ladies will pay, will they?"" It just creates a whole new medical disparity for women of color and disabled women and low income women. 

Capitalism is *not* our friend. Not for women with medical needs. 

The insurance companies need to be required to cover it. It takes legislation.  Remember it wasn't so long ago that an insurance company wouldn't cover you if you had a ""preexisting condition"". And the only thing that put an end to that greedy, barbaric policy was federal legislation prohibiting insurance companies from doing that. 

Insurance companies used to refuse to cover all kinds of actual life saving procedures too. Every time... it was government regulations that put an end to their chokeholds on our access to care. 

Likewise, more regulation needs to come down hard on pharmaceutical companies for charging criminal prices of drugs. 

The only way to do any of this is to get the government involved. (And have **more women** representing/leading in our government.)"
10qtzhs,"I take gabapentin twice a day. It helps with both hot flashes and permanent nerve damage from the surgery. It‚Äôs just so frustrating to see HRT recommended so much, when it‚Äôs not really an option for me. 2022 was my ten year mark, which is great, but ten years of dryness that rivals Death Valley, the creaky joints, osteopenia, and everything else is just. Unpleasant."
10qtzhs,"Now that I've got all this great information, I just need to find a doctor that'll help with all this! Been looking around, hate having to go out-of-network but might not have a choice."
10qtzhs,"That's great information, thank you!"
10qtzhs,"I did read that, but assumed that was just a couple highlights. I appreciate you posting it to the comments! It had me interested in reading the full article . Anytime something brings awareness to this, it gives me a little hope. My only concern is I hope the takeaway for some people who read this isn't that hrt is dangerous for women 60+, because I could see that happening. One day I will BE 60+, and I don't want them taking my hrt away from me, EVER."
10qtzhs,"Awesome, thank you!"
10qtzhs,"Right? ""Penis atrophy? Don't you worry your pretty little head about that, Sir. Just go home and take care of your wife."""
10qtzhs,"Thank gawd for this sub, indeed. EVERYTHING helpful that I know--and the relief I now enjoy from the hell on earth that is peri--is because of this group."
10qtzhs,"If somebody gets bc for the estrogen, is there a way to balance it with progesterone? I never used The Pill."
10qtzhs,"I think it's age, birth control is supposed to be for younger women and HRT for older, and risk goes up with  age.  But there is no line.  If you are POI you might be on HRT at 35 and if you are late to menopause you might still be trying to prevent pregnancy into your 50s.  So there is no one hard and fast age that separates one from the other (except pregnancy after 55 is considered pretty universally impossible and HRT does tend to be discouraged after 60)."
10qtzhs,"I think cost is a big factor, the bc is def cheaper. I also don't think women's health is taken seriously,  they think hrt is optional instead of medically necessary. It could be gatekeeping, but this issue has been around so long it's hard to say. As for risks, the bc pill actually has more risks than hrt, so they aren't trying to protect us."
10qtzhs,"As someone who is trans and in peri, I fear that as well."
10qtzhs,There's a site called in house pharmacy. Not exactly shady - I have ordered several things from them over the years and they were legit!
10qtzhs,"Wynona but it's compounded, so you won't be getting brand name anything."
10qtzhs,"I agree with you. Though I agree that hormones are affected by diet, stress exposure, hereditary predispositions, etc., it‚Äôs just to some extent. Plus the way I‚Äôm dismissed by my girl friends (who are in menopause or peri) when I try to talk about it, the gynecologists (I got checked by more than two because I‚Äôm trying to alleviate my symptoms; they‚Äôre starting to affect my work and income), and other women..  it‚Äôs so isolating."
10qtzhs,"I was in a cab and I suddenly felt fear. Like something bad is going to happen. But of course there was none because I was in a busy street. I‚Äôve been living alone for 15 years with three dogs and suddenly, I was craving for another human being inside the apartment. I‚Äôve never ever had these emotions before, and that‚Äôs what makes it scarier for me. :( The fear became too much that I went to the ER three times in a span of 4 weeks. I thought I was going crazy. Physical exams were negative except my FSH levels were in the early menopause threshold. Now, I even suspect I might‚Äôve entered perimenopause 6 years ago, when I started having sudden palpitations. All my physical exam results have been negative, but why the sudden fear? Now, I‚Äôm thinking the psychiatrist must‚Äôve misdiagnosed me. I mean, I may really have Depression and General Anxiety but it‚Äôs not because of the circumstances at work or my personal life but because of the effects of perimenopause. I kept telling the psychiatrists if my moods might be from this but they keep recommending psychiatric meds that did nothing to alleviate my symptoms. I was prescribed Quetiapine and Sertraline low dosages. I‚Äôm in a healthy weight and I‚Äôve been intermittently swimming, doing yoga, jogging/walking for the past 8 years. I feel I‚Äôm more active than many women in my age group in my country. I rarely eat cakes, chocolate, ice cream, sweets, hamburgers, fries, bacon, processed foods. I stopped drinking milk. I only consume these when I couldn‚Äôt avoid them at gatherings, so as not to be disrespectful to the hosts, despite the fact I can still eat anything and I have no maintenance medications yet. But I dread the time my period arrives.m because I know for sure, my symptoms will appear again. Not to sound dramatic but I‚Äôm a hostage of these hormones. üòû I‚Äôll try to look into a functional doctor in my area too. Thank you, LB Winky, for your input."
10qtzhs,"I‚Äôm Asian and I live in SE Asia. Worst was during the IE, the female gynecologist asked me if I had a religion. I said, Uhh, non-practicing Catholic? While having the PAP smear, she suggested, ‚ÄúYou might want to pray to God again. It helps.‚Äù Doctor or not, I‚Äôm starting to hate it when people use the Religion card or God card. I believe in God and I try to be a good person, but I‚Äôm in your examination table right now, Doc, not the confessional box! Lol"
10qtzhs,Under the age of 60 is still considered 'safe' where the benefits outweigh the risks...so you're good.
10qtzhs,"Over 60, not 55, is when it becomes riskier. You are still in the range and a good range. If you take HRT within 5 years of menopause your dementia risks are lowered as well as heart issues."
10qtzhs,"Please see a doctor about this and go over your medical history. Just because CVD runs in your family *does not* mean you are not a candidate for HRT.  

It can depend on what age family members were when they were diagnosed with CVD, how closely related they are to you, and whether you yourself have personal history of CVD. 

Not only that, but even if your family history were determined to be a risk factor, *the decision to take HRT should be yours to make,* based on being educated of what the possible risks are (hopefully by the provider you are consulting with) and whether you feel that the benefits for you outweigh those risks. 

Please make an appt as soon as possible and use the NAMS list of providers in your area as a starting point. If you find out that it‚Äôs not for you because the risk seems too great, at least you know you had the opportunity to make an informed choice. And it may be that the risk is not too great! Or‚Äîthere could be other options.

10qtzhs,"Yes, this. U/yeah_so_no, don‚Äôt let this wishy-washy doc call the shots (or not, so to speak.) üíú

ETA: corrected ‚Äúwishy wasn‚Äôt‚Äù to ‚Äúwishy-washy‚Äù üôÑ"
10qtzhs,"Yeah, I really like this doctor but was disappointed in that. Fortunately he is easy to work with and not opposed to constructive criticism. I do see a meno specialist from the wiki list for my hormones now."
10qtzhs,"Birth control absolutely helped with my sleep, though."
10qtzhs,"I agree that if a doc someone is seeing is on the fence about whether to prescribe hrt for menopause symptoms, it seems like being proactive and showing them current research articles will likely help. 

But if they still are not willing to prescribe and you feel that the benefits would outweigh the risks for you, just go elsewhere. 

But please keep In mind that many docs in US will be going by the current guidelines from establishment US organizations such as NAMS itself (2022, below, italics mine), which states that HRT is of primary benefit for vasomotor (hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (vaginal dryness etc) symptoms of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture.  

Note that the guidelines *do not say* that it is the most effective treatment for any other symptoms or for prevention of any other diseases. (But if you say / feel that the reason your sleep / mood is suffering is due to *hot flashes, night sweats, and/or genitourinary symptoms* it seems that would be considered a good reason for HRT.) 

From NAMS Position Statement, 2022 ( 
https://www.menopause.org/docs/default-source/professional/nams-2022-hormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf ) 

‚ÄúHormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for *vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome* of menopause and *has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture.* The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy.


For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable *for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss.* For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.‚Äù

10qtzhs,Even the older ones steer you towards ‚Äúmore mindfulness‚Äù as mine does.
10qtzhs,"I'm so sorry to hear and I couldn't agree more. Losing my organs is the worst thing in my life; even after 3 years I cry. They posed it to me like I had no options, but the KEY thing was, did I want kids? So if I had said yes there WAS an alternative?? Of course with tumors and fibroids it's easier to do just a clean sweep. 

But to your point: I'm scared about the ovary left behind. First of all, it's provided apparently zero of the hormones he said I'd be ""full of."" I've battled immediate clinical depression, all the body morph changes (hot to not) and total loss of libido. 

Now that one ovary I'm wondering about because I have lower back pain on one side that persists and I'm wondering it's that. How did you know? Thanks btw!"
10qtzhs,Yes to this!!
10qtzhs,Yes and NAMS can be used for Canada as well.
10qtzhs,"Progesterone *cream* isn't absorbed well, but progesterone in a patch (like combipatch) is different than the cream."
10qtzhs,"This is helpful to hear echoed on here. 

As one of the 30% of women without a uterus, and knowing that I would like to try hormone therapy in my near future, I feel like I would also need to advocate for trying progesterone as well. 

So many ‚Äúold ways of [medical] thinking‚Äù to be turned on it‚Äôs head, generally speaking."
10qtzhs,Excellent points! I stand corrected!!!
10qtzhs,"You want to look into something that will protect bones, I don't think Gaba helps with that, in fact it may contribute to decreased bone mass.  Talk to your doctor about SERMS, non-hormonal options where some can help with hot flashes as well as bone loss."
10qtzhs,"I'm 61 and docs have been trying to take my estradiol away or lower it considerably. Once I try to lower my dose, menopause symptoms start up. I don't ever want to be without it!"
10qtzhs,"They would say: ""You are too young for penis atrophy!"""
10qtzhs,"Most bc pills contain both. There is a progesterone only pill as well, but afaik there isn't an estrogen only bc."
10qtzhs,You can get a script for Prometrium. It's bioidentical progesterone.
10qtzhs,"Yes I agree with you. There is more estrogen/progesterone in birth control than there is in HRT. 

And I think this factors in to birth control being prescribed for symptoms of pre- or perimenopause, and therefore typically in younger individuals, versus those in menopause."
10qtzhs,Can confirm
10qtzhs,"Good luck - and don't give up!   I know my anxiety and panic attacks were related to my low estrogen, low progesterone and my high cortisol.    One month on my new regimen of bioidentical hormones and I am feeling SO much better."
10qtzhs,I started reading all your comments and I could relate with you to a T! As in! I may be younger but I can identify with you! You are not alone. And I live in the Philippines too! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
10qtzhs,"Whoa. What a thing to say while she‚Äôs doing the Pap smear. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I agree. Let‚Äôs not discuss theological issues while I am being examined. Let‚Äôs just discuss‚Ä¶ uh, the examination? Other relevant things? üòÜ 

I wonder if there‚Äôs a cultural norm you are up against with regards to complaints about menopause symptoms. Heh. I mean, I say that while  being aware that clearly it‚Äôs not just SE Asia. üôÑ but I wonder if it‚Äôs a more cohesive norm there? And I thought of this because I noticed more than one study on cultural differences in the perception of menopause (although it did not seem that any definite conclusions were reached.)  but either way, we all have to keep trying to get what we want/need. 

I have had such an easier time finding decent providers because of where I am and I am grateful and I so wish I could bestow that gift upon you as well. 

Did you check to see if there is a SE Asian menopause society/ org?

10qtzhs,"They do tend to say over 60 or 10 years from menopause though.  So if one was fully menopausal at 45 and took no HRT, one might be kind of reaching the more harm than benefit category by 55."
10qtzhs,"Oh ok, good to know!  Thank you for the clarification.  

Also, isn't it pathetic that as women, we need to educate ourselves to this level in order to maintain our health?"
10qtzhs,"I don‚Äôt take gabapentin for bone loss, I primarily take it for permanent nerve damage from surgery and hot flashes. Constant burning pain from the nerve damage makes life almost unbearable without the gabapentin. 
As far as SERMS, those act on hormones; I was on tamoxifen for five years. Now I‚Äôm post-menopausal, I take arimidex instead. Unfortunately, arimidex can contribute to bone loss, but helps to prevent cancer recurrence. My oncologist is my prescribing doctor for both of those meds."
10qtzhs,"I don't blame you! I watched my sons grandmother get pulled off hrt, and she hasn't been the same since. Memory problems, sleep issues, hot flashes, weight gain.. It made me so angry on her behalf, and terrified of my own future as a woman. I don't ever want to be without it either."

10qtzhs,"Thanks, guessing that's taken along with bc."
10qtzhs,I‚Äôll check into your infos. Thank youuuu! :)
10qtzhs,"What are your symptoms? I asked women around me but nobody tells me anything. Either they have no symptoms or they say they just got in HRT, that‚Äôs all. I feel like a freak for having this sudden inexplicable fear and then, when I try to look for answers, nobody explains it. Two psychiatrists, one psychologist, three gynecologists.. Nothing. :("
10qtzhs,"I think it‚Äôs even worse that too many gynecologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians aren‚Äôt even considering  symptoms of perimenopause or menopause when they try to diagnose female patients. If a patient is female and in her 30s, these symptoms could still surface. :("
10qtzhs,Why was she pulled off?
10qtzhs,"See, this is what I love about reddit. You learn something new every day! Thank you for sharing! I do not believe we do in the US because they are unwilling to prescribe estrogen only if you still have a uterus because of increased risk of cancer."
10qtzhs,"Well it depends. A lot of birth control is ""combination"" of estradiol and what's called ""progestin"". Progestin is like this... fake, lab designed, synthetic version of progesterone. But there are estradiol only birth control pills, too I think. So if you take a pill that is E only, then yeah, you could probably try Prometrium with it. Prometrium is real progesterone -- bioidentical to the stuff in our bodies. It's apparently better than progestin? I don't know the differences. But I would be wary of taking Prometrium with a combination pill that includes progestin. Too much progesterone might make a person pretty sick!"
10qtzhs,"They told her increased risk of breast cancer and that she was too old to continue taking it, that she was far enough out of menopause that she didn't need it anymore. Scared her enough with the breast cancer statement she didn't even question it.  ""the doctor said""....That was about ten years ago, and she still suffers. They even took away her vaginal estrogen, and she ended up with her fucking bladder in a sling. I didn't know enough about it back then to know the lack of estrogen causes issues to the urinary track too, but now that I do it makes me so sad and angry for her."
10qtzhs,"But if there‚Äôs an estradiol-only bc pill, it surely must only be given to individuals without a uterus? Otherwise, just as with hrt for menopause/perimenopause, the uterine lining would be building up and creating risk for uterine cancer?"

10ij1bl,"Heh. I asked my husband if he thought I smelled like Cool Ranch Doritos, because I‚Äôm pretty sure I do."
10ij1bl,"The smell of myself is unreal. I actually thought there was a gas leak the other night, but no."
10ij1bl,"A contractor would say, ‚Äúyou need support posts for your awning, this will cut down on your moisture, m‚Äôam‚Äù"
10ij1bl,Onions. I smell like onions.
10ij1bl,Swamp crotch is so awkward!! It always looks like I peed myself at the gym because the crotch is sweatier than any other part of me. It‚Äôs not pee!
10ij1bl,Use the cool shot button on your hair dryer.
10ij1bl,OMG thank you for this.  LOLOLOL!!  What are you missing ?  WEIGHT GAIN.  You can have some of mine!
10ij1bl,Omg you‚Äôre hilarious.  Sympathies tho‚Ä¶. I went thru that phase and it went away after about 18 months.  All you can do is laugh.  I was so damp for so long I got a fungal skin infection so be on the lookout for itchy rashes!
10ij1bl,Oh how I wish I had coins to award you for ‚Äústomach awning‚Äù
10ij1bl,"Your vagina kills ants ü§£. I will never forget this saying now. Thank your for the laugh. I‚Äôm laughing so hard right now. 

Ok in all seriousness‚Ä¶.pineapple or (yes very specifically) quest brand ready made salted caramel protein shakes (the powder won‚Äôt work.) I gave both depending on whether you eat sugar or not. Both will have you smelling sweet in about a day. Eat/drink some everyday. Just a little even. 

I have no clue how to stop the sweating but these will fix the odor unless it‚Äôs something medical such as BV."
10ij1bl,"The only thing I didn't see you mention is trying underwear pads. I had such terrible overblown hemorrhagic periods that I had to use bladder pads for the extra absorbency. After an emergency hysterectomy I kept using them since I've always had stress incontinence anyway. (sneezing, laughing, coughing etc.)

Pads definitely absorb whatever's going on with your undercarriage and there's no law saying you can't change the pads as frequently as it gives you peace of mind to do so."
10ij1bl,I had to switch to men‚Äôs deodorant and it use it not only for the pits but under my boobs and the stomach awning (my god I love this description! So apt). It helps with the moisture.

10ij1bl,"I've tried old cloth diapers and regular washcloths.  I just changed into a pair of excruciatingly-researched wool boxers a few hours ago after I woke up soaking wet and got up two hours later with my legs sweating off.  If I wear pants they get soaked, and if I wear boxers or bike shorts while I sleep then *I* get soaked baahahaaa!  It's *awful!*

I've assembled a formative offense over the past few years:  Lume/Old Spice/spray Dove, bamboo underboob liners, a collection of ancient cloth diapers and random towels, a very expensive cooling blanket, unscented absorbing powder, and a very abused hairdryer.  Even my fucking *feet* sweat.  

HRT has kept me from having to change clothes 3x/day and has allowed me to sometimes wear jackets this winter but the dampness is just out of control.  It necessitates staying hydrated as to not get headaches, general electrolyte imbalances, and more wrinkles, which makes me PEE ALL OF THE TIME.  I cannot win."
10ij1bl,"I never put it together that my crotch swamp was part of this, separate from the hot flashes and random sweatiness. Thank you for making me feel normal and gross!"
10ij1bl,My husbands says: The worst possible smells we're experiencing in our bodies can't match an average smell from a man.
10ij1bl,Are you a practicing comedian? Please complain here ever day. You must be protected at all costs. I am crying about being a middle aged flying squirrel üêøÔ∏è!!!

We can support each other and find humor in our plight!!!!"
10ij1bl,"Yeah. Sitting, standing, doing nothing, yet still: an invisible mist finely radiates through my pores without my consent or understanding. I look down at my blazing forearms and ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù - I look and the people around me and wonder ‚Äúhow the fuck are you wearing a sweater right now?‚Äù I could cook eggs on various parts of my body."
10ij1bl,"Yet the vaginal wall is as dry as a bone, am I right?

I‚Äôve taken vaginal estrogen, and it does help. 

Also, bring an extra pair of undies wherever you go. Men wonder why we need big purses?"
10ij1bl,"Yet to buy any to say if any good, but someone suggested bamboo knickers for potentially less sweat generating"
10ij1bl,"Reading this through my fogged up glasses, during a hot flash and laughing"
10ij1bl,Omg the moistness! I hate it so much.
10ij1bl,I literally carry a small handheld fan around with me all summer (It's not as bad in the winter). I look insane but I am cooler.
10ij1bl,"I‚Äôve adopted a shameful habit. When i‚Äôm swapping out my HRT patches, I‚Äôll sniff the patch I‚Äôve just removed. It smells sour, gamey. I am repulsive."
10ij1bl,"Oh. My. God. I haven't laughed this much in so long. I'm sure it's mainly because I can relate so much. Your wording, though ü§£"
10ij1bl,I bought some Summers Eve feminine deodorant spray. It seems to help temporarily - but the challenge is getting that area dry enough first so it doesn't end up like a paste. I have some Lume - doesn't seem to do much for me but the wipes helped my husband. I am always wondering if other people can smell what I am....the hits keep coming huh with this menopause thing :(
10ij1bl,You should do a meno blog you are so funny.
10ij1bl,Why is everywhere moist BUT my vagina? Ugh! üòÖ. And these damn enormous boobs!!!
10ij1bl,"For moisture in your skinfolds. . . If it begins to cause icky skin, redness or rash try Medline Skin fold Dry sheets. They contain the same gel beads as diapers, or incontinent pads that pull moisture away from you, but the sheets are thin!"
10ij1bl,"This has to be tied to some kinds of fluctuation - some days I‚Äôm fine, some days I am thankful I work remotely üòÇ I really want to research better underwear and better deodorant - those won‚Äôt solve the problem but it will be part of the solutions I hope."
10ij1bl,"I'm not moist, but omg, I sweat like a landscaper now."
10ij1bl,"I just came from Insta where I saw a screenshot of Justin Trudeau wearing the YouTube play icon as a Hitler 'stashe and the first thing I see on Reddit is the word ""moist"" ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


Well. Now I need to get out of bed and try to be productive lol"
10ij1bl,"I seem to be past the super smelly stage, but what fun that was! It doesn‚Äôt help that our sense of smell can also be heightened during perimenopause. You‚Äôre braver than I ever was. I could never bring myself to ask DH if I smelled. üò¨ 

Sorry that I have no good advice for the smells. I use Humble brand of deodorant now, but not sure it would‚Äòve worked on the male puberty-level odor I emitted at my worst. 

But I do have a warning, especially if you‚Äôre prone to night sweats as well. Make sure you clean your belly button well or you might just end up with a nice infection to go with your stomach awning. Not fun, according to a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô."
10ij1bl,"I have no helpful comments, just here to say thanks for this.  I will be laughing about it for at least the next 48-72 business hours!"
10ij1bl,"He should be happy to smell your vagina. His answer should always be an enthusiastic ""Yes!"", followed by an ingratiating ""Thank you!"""
10ij1bl,This is the best thing I‚Äôve read in the last 51 (all my) years.
10ij1bl,Crystal deodorant.  I will not go without it.
10ij1bl,I hear you. I sleep with a cotton baby diaper between my legs to soak up the sweat.
10ij1bl,"I had to change from solid deodorant to clear gel, for some reason my body chemistry suddenly changed and the white deodorant would smell horrible on me.  I also bought a natural body deodorant called ‚Äòundercarriage‚Äô that seems to be not bad, it‚Äôs made with coconut oil, baking soda and charcoal i think, i used it in all my ‚Äòfolds‚Äô LOL.  I‚Äôve seen one advertised called Lumi, but it‚Äôs int he US and I‚Äôm in canada and not sure it‚Äôs worth getting it shipped and paying the exchange.  Has anyone ever used?"
10ij1bl,"Not to understate the miseries of Meno, but if you are taking any medications, check to see if others taking the same meds complain of excessive sweating. I have taken Duloxetine for years but only started excessive sweating the last 5 yrs or so. Tried everything to stop it and then saw others in a Duloxetine sub saying sweating was a huge side effect and started dropping my dose a few months ago. I am so much drier & comfortable now."
10ij1bl,"Look on the bright side, borax powder also repels cockroaches üòÇ"
10ij1bl,Repels ants‚Ä¶.hilarious !‚ù§Ô∏è
10ij1bl,Linen? Also are you actually running fevers?
10ij1bl,"Carpe deodorant and powders are amazing for the dampness.  I use the deodorant once and it lasts for 3 days with ZERO moisture.  Like, my pits are desert dry during a drought.  

The powder has a weird feel to it due to the clay content, but it too leaves your skin DRY.  I don‚Äôt care for the women‚Äôs groin powder scent.  It‚Äôs supposed to smell like white jasmin but misses by miles.  The men‚Äôs groin powder has menthol in it so you don‚Äôt want to accidentally get it between your lips, lol, but the smell is fresh and feels cooling."
10ij1bl,"My daughter suffers from hyper hydrosis, damn autocorrect, and we buy Certain Dri extra strength clinical solid. Used to be able to buy it in the store. Now we order them online. 

Long story short: I now use it. It‚Äôs fantastic."
10ij1bl,"Oh my god I feel your pain, but you just made me laugh so hard and I thank you for that!!!"
10ij1bl,"Hehe stomach awnings unite! Honestly, the sweating is out of control."
10ij1bl,Carpe groin powder. I'm 39 and I have been dealing with this for 3 years. I want it to go. Thought I was peri but no I'm diabetic. My groin and but Crack are always in some sort of healing from cracked sink from moisture or dryness from the powders and the moist and the dryness can be millimeters apart.
10ij1bl,"I put my glasses on after a shower and looked at my vagina and was shocked that it had dropped so far down it could not be seen unless the hubble telescope was searching 

Now I'm either going to get a face lift or a vagina lift. Which one is worth it?

OP look up wisp.com and get the BV treatment and after sex get in the shower and clean well. Even use your fingers to wipe out whatever is still in there. Use baby wash to do so. It will not mess up your p.h. then continue your boric acid to have that nice smell. I also use carpe or similar product to keep the sweat at bay."
10ij1bl,"I even think that my eyeballs sweat now.  Everything sweats.   I try to stick to natural fibres for all clothing, cotton, linen, light wool in the winter.  I layer my outfits in colder weather.   All this and I am still sitting here typing bathed in sweat.   Everything makes me hot, even thinking hard.  I really hate how my hair style is constantly ruined because of how hot my head is.  Glad to hear I am not the only one with swamp crotch.  I thought I was just gross.  At home I wear a light dress and no underwear to air it out."
10ij1bl,"I feel this so hard.

And yes, the thigh creases are the worst! I'll wake up completely dry everywhere else, but with moist thigh creases and correspondingly damp cotton underwear.

FWIW, I've managed to eradicate dampness in all  the major hotspots except the thigh folds. I use Zero Sweat (the one with aloe) at night two days a week. I use Vanicream antiperspirant the remaining days of the week, also at night. And in the morning when I wake up I use carpe under breast lotion. I use each of these on my armpits, under my breasts, between my breasts, on my thigh folds. Oh! And I have to use all these products underneath my butt cheeks because, of course.

But my thigh folds? They just laugh at my futile efforts. I'm sorry you're going through this, but I'm glad I'm not the only one. I was really starting to feel like something was wrong with me."
10ij1bl,I'm crying. And rolling. And damp.
10ij1bl,The comments here have me deceased! I'm crying!
10ij1bl,"Dearest OP. I know you are coming here looking for solutions, and so it is not helpful to read that you made me snort my tea. I thought I was laughing hard when I read ‚ÄúA marriage can only survive the sentence ‚ÄòCan you smell my vagina‚Äô for so long‚Äù,  but then I got to ‚ÄúTaken diflucan, HRT, bought borax pills so now my still damp vagina also repels ants.‚Äù I tried to read it out loud to my boyfriend but by then I was laughing so hard, I couldn‚Äôt get all the way through it. All I can do is thank you for starting my morning off right. Maybe the cold comfort of this reply will offer some drying properties to your moist nether regions."
10ij1bl,OMG that's the funniest description of a universal experience that I've ever read!!!
10ij1bl,Lume is your answer!
10ij1bl,I‚Äôve used rest room paper towels and switch them out. Better than nothing.
10ij1bl,I‚Äôve just been diagnosed with a uti and wonder if moisture is a factor. Anyone else?
10ij1bl,I am a literal swamp. I dread summer because it gets even worse. It's ridiculous.
10ij1bl,"I use the ordinary glycolic acid like a lume type deodorant. I put some on cotton pads and hit up my underarms, underboob, bellybutton, etc. After my shower. Let it dry then add actual deodorant to the places safe for that. 

I am a big fan of Good Wipes ‚ÄòDown there wipes‚Äô in rose water for downstairs freshen ups (I also use the same brand of feminine wash), and I have become a fan of panty liners."
10ij1bl,U guys just made my day
10ij1bl,"Yeah, so much moist"
10ij1bl,"Yes. Yuck. Feels like shock sometimes between the sweats and chills. I discovered that my blow dryer brings comfort and relief. The cold shot, the just warm enough to dry the sweat. Jmho."
10ij1bl,What about Body Glide? It also works well.
10ij1bl,I read it here somewhere but - Thai Crystal Deodorant.
10ij1bl,Use Lume. Doesn't stop the sweating but it miraculously stops odor. All of it.  Everywhere!!!!  It's pricey but so worth it!
10ij1bl,"I object to the title of this post!  Jk, I sympathize OP lol. HRT has helped me but I know it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone. 
Though maybe adjusting dosage would help?"
10ij1bl,"Y'all may be interested in undergarments made with a fabric called micromodal.  Yes, it's more expensive, but this stuff is so freaking buttery soft, is more breathable than cotton, and is more moisture wicking, as well.  I have never felt so comfortable in my uncomfortable skin.  

There's also modal, which is still better than cotton, but not as luxurious as micromodal.  Seriously, even if you don't replace all of your undergarments, at least get you a pair or two for the bad days."
10ij1bl,Citalopram Hbr helped me with this. 20 mg per day. I don‚Äôt know the scientific reason why. My gyn prescribed it.
10ij1bl,Thanks for giving me a laugh. ‚ÄúRepels ants‚Äù hahaha
10ij1bl,"Get some nappy rash cream for babies, apply it after shower & drying. You use less if you apply it while your skin still moist.

Apply them anywhere you feels damp, under boobs, between thighs, etc.

For itch use fungal cream instead, apply it on clean moist skin helps spread the cream better too.

I live in the tropics, both those things helps on a very humid days.

For smelly armpits I used armpits whitening cream. It does kills the smell when my deodorants & fungal creams failed."
10ij1bl,Use secret deodorant everywhere. That‚Äôs what I do. Use the stick not the spray. Obviously not internally. Lol.
10ij1bl,"YMMV, caveat emptor, all that.

Hand sanitizer
 
I swear to you, it's the way to recover when out and about. Rub it on your pits, rub it in your folds, but for God's sake (old and new), don't get it on your sensitive bits. Stops the smell in its tracks and helps with the moisture. 

Best part? It is EVERYWHERE and no one thinks twice if they see a bottle of hand sanitizer in your bag."
10ij1bl,"Thank you so much for the laugh. A much much needed laugh. I wish I had some words to help, but I‚Äôm with you in this madness called menopause.

I also have the great advantage of forgetting everything including words and how to spell them."
10ij1bl,You. Are. Hilarious.
10ij1bl,"I 100% feel your pain, except I've had swamp crotch pretty much my entire post puberty life.  I  do appreciate the laugh.  Your description of this hell was hilarious as well as accurate."
10ij1bl,Have you tried merino wool (icebreaker / smartwool brands -- $$$) but they take a long to stink. Merino wool is soft and amazing. Very difficult to make it stink.
10ij1bl,"sorry, I laughed out loud at the repels ants and if you find something, let me know.  I am now sleeping in long sleeve pajamas because waking up with sweating legs was disgusting"
10ij1bl,"It‚Äôs my back that gets me. Why does it seem to have a sticky film of some sort now? I ordered a back brush, and hopefully that will help."
10ij1bl,I love my menopause sisters!!
10ij1bl,I üíñ you. Thanks for making me laugh!
10ij1bl,I‚Äôve switched to glycerine soap. It helps a little. Better than dove soap.
10ij1bl,How does one get started with HRT and where to go what to do
10ij1bl,"I call mine my ""modesty flap"". It allows me to get undressed without exposing myself to the world."
10ij1bl,I call mine Gunther. It‚Äôs a blend of my gut and my cunt. My husband looks so pained when I rub my lower gut and say ‚ÄúI shall name him‚Ä¶ Gunther‚Äù
10ij1bl,I second this üò≠üò≠ It's accurate af.
10ij1bl,üòÇüòÇüòÇI have a stomach awning you could park a car under
10ij1bl,"My ex referred to this as ‚ÄúFUPA‚Äù it works for both men and women‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfat under p_ _ _ _ area‚Äù lol! I had this happening also before I started HRT and another reason I did, I honestly didn‚Äôt even want to leave the house and was convinced everyone could smell me and I was dating someone at the time, just an awful experience, like being in middle school again‚Ä¶"
10ij1bl,"I laughed so hard at @stomach awning I cried! Boy, I needed that!"
10ij1bl,Is this different from the dreaded ‚Äúmuffin top‚Äù?
10ij1bl,"Dang this, so not everyone can afford a tummy tuck‚Ä¶..ah I wish I didn‚Äôt have an awning either.  Most people pay 20k to have it built not have it removed."
10ij1bl,I call it my cat hang.
10ij1bl,Handheld fans are ESSENTIAL PPE.
10ij1bl,Omg I wonder if he thought you did it for him!! I‚Äôm hysterical laughing
10ij1bl,Lume deodorant is heaven sent! I cannot believe how well it works but it does!
10ij1bl,"I‚Äôll get one armpit that smells randomly, I barely have to have exerted myself or even be sweating. And I‚Äôll notice it at work thinking it‚Äôs fucking food and then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh dear god it‚Äôs me!‚Äù Lol"
10ij1bl,I smell like barbecue sauce but feel like it's in the same scent family as Cool Ranch doritos.
10ij1bl,Bwahahhahahah. I too know this smell.
10ij1bl,Corn chip smell is from bacteria pseudomonas and Proteus. Try Lume perhaps?
10ij1bl,Swear I have BO that smells like Cheetos.
10ij1bl,"Yep. Me too! I was using Lume deodorant for over two years. I had to switch back to traditional antiperspirant about 8 months ago, because I was smelling myself all of the time.   

To manage any type of unpleasant smells in my crotch region, I use feminine wipes - for sensitive skin. They seem to help. It‚Äôs weird, because the skin underneath my tummy awning well get smelly and then sometimes it isn‚Äôt. Haven‚Äôt figured out that pattern yet. 

Dealing with constant dry skin and moisture in all my folds has been a battle. I have to be strategic with where I put lotion while keeping other spots dry so they don‚Äôt stink. It‚Äôs a hella lot of work."
10ij1bl,Me too. Summer makes it worse. Hate it so much
10ij1bl,Isnt that normal though? I've smelled like that since I hit puberty unless I keep my pits clean and deodorized.
10ij1bl,Baking soda on outside of panties. No more saut√©ed onions!
10ij1bl,"When I‚Äôm sitting on a plastic chair, stand up and there‚Äôs a fucking wet spot on the chair. Underwear is constantly wet, no matter if it‚Äôs hot or cold out."
10ij1bl,"I call it ‚ÄúSC‚Äù, short for ‚Äúsweaty crotch.‚Äù Swamp crotch is way better though!"
10ij1bl,"Well, at least you KNOW that. I kinda gave up on jiu-jitsu because I couldn't be sure if it was sweat or pee and either way I just couldn't ask someone I barely knew to put their face in my swamp crotch."
10ij1bl,You just need different pants. Make sure they are black. And I really like new day leggings from target it hides the wetness from sweat much less noticeable.
10ij1bl,[I have been scarred for life after doing this on my nether regions.](https://media.giphy.com/media/aBfSGPDRDSdqw/giphy.gif)
10ij1bl,I used to lift weights with a trainer and we were pretty friendly and somehow one day in conversation he started complaining about how in every single men's locker room there's always an old guy standing there naked and drying his balls with a hairdryer
10ij1bl,How about flaky hair üò°
10ij1bl,Seriously Im starting to worry - did you just use some OTC to combat it?
10ij1bl,It goes away? I‚Äôve had it for 10 years. It‚Äôs my new normal.
10ij1bl,"I have to give a shoutout to Outshine Pineapple Fruit bars. They‚Äôre amazing and frozen like a popsicle. Also, I just learned my favorite treat might be the reason my crotch is not too swampy and smelly."
10ij1bl,"And if it‚Äôs BV you can get boric acid capsules on Amazon, they are the cure.  As someone prone to BV these literally changed my life.   You can also use them proactively when you don‚Äôt have one.  I do one every couple of weeks."
10ij1bl,"Yup, this is what I do.  In the summer, I have to air dry first.  It all sucks, because the rest of my body NEEDS lotion, some parts need Vaseline, some parts needs urea lotion.  This is after scrubbing.  I've turned into a damn car that needs to be detailed.  ü§£üò≠ü§£"
10ij1bl,"Degree is my go to. 
Also Dove antiperspirant spray.  
It‚Äôs great in the summer for back sweat"
10ij1bl,Also note Aluminium antiperspirants work Much better if applied religiously every day on DRY skin. It massively improves their effectiveness.
10ij1bl,"I stand before him confident that my farts can be worse than any man‚Äôs odour. Not gonna lie, sometimes I‚Äôm both horrified and proud."
10ij1bl,You know what?  He‚Äôs RIGHT.
10ij1bl,"I had that problem and someone suggested I start taking slippery elm bark every day. Hallelujah, it worked!"
10ij1bl,"I am going to definitely try those but my luck, Im going to attract pandas."
10ij1bl,Bamboo is amazing.  Can confirm.
10ij1bl,You do not look insane! A handheld fan for all season is the classy secret code that allows a peri-sister to know another. A bit like the guys in the movie ‚ÄúThe Sting‚Äù would acknowledge one another. You carry it with pride lady!
10ij1bl,"Do you mean the paper fold ones? Or a small battery powered mini oscillating fan?

I mean I'd use both. Paper hand held fan reads yes insane, but gentle, quirky side of the scale. Battery held might be more along the insane scale, but would give you better cooling."
10ij1bl,"I use hubby's old tube socks for under the bra and the tummy awning. 

I'd use washable liners for the nethers, but it's so random that I'd rather invest in some period panties for the long term."
10ij1bl,"I changed to Dove 48 hour a few years ago when regular stopped working for me.   I feel guilty buying aerosol, but being able to spray all the OPs aforementioned areas gets me through the day."
10ij1bl,Just try to do so without speaking moistly‚Ä¶
10ij1bl,[deleted]
10ij1bl,This is my husband all the time any time. Can confirm. It‚Äôs awesome.
10ij1bl,I use that but have found that the Lume deodorant works better for smell. I sometimes put the thin pads in my bra for wetness‚Ä¶.  Doc begged me not to use antiperspirant because of the aluminum content.
10ij1bl,"I love my crystal deodorant, but when it gets humid...say May to September I switch to Lume.  It doesn't handle the heat well for me and I get too damp.  I'd use it year round if I could."
10ij1bl,"I haven't used it, but I'll never buy it bc of the ads. They infuriate me for some reason. Lol"
10ij1bl,"I tried the unscented one. Ugh, it smelled horrible and was even worse at the end of the day. I couldn't stand it- I even tossed it out. That's my experience anyway. I've read that others had the same experience with the unscented but other people swear by it. <<shrug>>"
10ij1bl,Effexor does this to me. It's infuriating.
10ij1bl,"No, I‚Äôve checked. It‚Äôs just general obnoxiousness."
10ij1bl,"Yes! That's the one my kid uses, and it must work because she FREAKS. OUT if she's running low and can't get another one stat."
10ij1bl,"Groin powder.

Groin powder.

Wow, this is not a happy phrase, but it lives in my mind now alongside ""scrubby pine"", which plays in my head like hours of Philip Glass if I'm on Cape Cod, which fortunately/unfortunately is almost never."
10ij1bl,"If you get a tight enough face lift you'll get a bonus vag lift,  ftw!"
10ij1bl,same to thinking everything sweats now
10ij1bl,The opposite worked for me. I find cotton underwear just absorbs the moisture and stays wet. The smell is sickening. All polyester underwear with no cotton panel in the crotch keeps me dry.
10ij1bl,Those work really well! At least the ones at my old job did.
10ij1bl,"They are scratchy, though."
10ij1bl,[This](https://www.ulta.com/p/exfoliating-hydro-towel-prod5503167?sku=5503167&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1218696922541&CAAGID=106753280571&CAWELAID=202391183&CATARGETID=330000200002751005&CADevice=m&gbraid=0AAAAAD9rLH6KYiO0yWmpGszfrfa6foy9W&gclid=CjwKCAiA2rOeBhAsEiwA2Pl7Q0vg-bu2DQE16IM3GV6fAM1N5icGfLAb3bMDAFhyQ2i_2dgrJQ73NhoCZLgQAvD_BwE) really helped me with feeling like my back was cleaner after each shower now that it‚Äôs getting harder to reach everything!
10ij1bl,‚ÄúModesty flap‚Äù I‚Äôm dying lmfao ü§£
10ij1bl,Hee hee lol

ü§£ü§£ü§£"
10ij1bl,Omg I‚Äôm dead! I love that so much!
10ij1bl,That's brilliant.
10ij1bl,You made me laugh and I really needed a laugh today. Thank you.
10ij1bl,Sitting here cackling and snorting! (When did I start making these fecking noises to indicate mirth?) Damn near dying laughing! Literally! Like the old definition of literally. Wheezing and tears obliterating my vision. My dog is concerned! ü§£
10ij1bl,This group makes me inordinately happy.
10ij1bl,"Omg, you made me laugh so hard, I couldn‚Äôt stop. Thank you!! I love fantasy & gaming so Gunther just hit hard."
10ij1bl,"Yes. The Dreaded Muffin Top happens when your pants are maybe a smidge too tight but it somehow generates an entire small beanbag of flesh and fat above your waistband. 

The Stomach Awning‚Ñ¢Ô∏è happens when you take off your clothes and realize that whatever fat you have in your belly area has decided to slide south and cover part of your genitals."
10ij1bl,I've had mine since having c section. The scar made fat droop over instead of sticking out.
10ij1bl,We could start an alternative Only Fans‚Ä¶middle aged women standing butt naked in front of a giant fan sweating profusely and holding our breasts aloft. There‚Äôs probably a kink for that.
10ij1bl,Had a moment today: actually needed that extra pair of undies. They were in a bag in the fridge with my lunch at work. They felt so great going on!
10ij1bl,ü§£
10ij1bl,I came here to recommend Lume as well! It‚Äôs amazing.
10ij1bl,My left armpit smells within fourteen seconds of getting out of the shower. I can‚Äôt take it.
10ij1bl,ME TOO! My right arm pit is such an asshole. I‚Äôm always sniffing my pits because I‚Äôm terrified other people can smell me. I ask my husband all the time if he can smell me.
10ij1bl,Baking soda on outside of panties. No more Doritos!
10ij1bl,It's beef and tomato pot noodles for me. Or chlorine. Sometimes my minge smells like chlorine. Odd.
10ij1bl,I'm getting more of a mothball smell! Send help!!
10ij1bl,"I don't have a diagnosis or anything yet, I'm only 38 and I've been feeling this way for a couple years. Already had a shit ton of bloodwork and now they want to do more, they want to do something called a ""nerve test"" which sounds like they just poke me with electric needles for an hour. I am tired of tests and the more I am on this group the more I think that I'm just in peri. 

The worst is the brain fog. I am kind of sensitive about being laughed at and my partner thinks it's funny that my brain is like an etch-a-sketch and he laughs every time I ask what time he is starting or ending work that day (we are down to one car at the moment). 

I'm seeing my PCP next month to see if hormone therapy might be right for me (and to ask for a regimen to stop taking the useless antidepressant my previous PCP forced me to try)"
10ij1bl,FYI.  Lume has just updated their scents.  SO MUCH BETTER and longer lasting. Give them a shot again
10ij1bl,I know! Suffering through it now in Australia.   Literally counting down the weeks to Autumn.
10ij1bl,"My sweat had more of a B.O. locker room smell, it was only last year that my sweat started to smell like onions. Like sweet Vidalia onions to be specific lol"
10ij1bl,"Nope, this is a scent that doesn't care if you're clean and deodorized, it comes out anyway and overpowers soap, deodorant and anything else you try to sanitize with."
10ij1bl,"My pits smell like onions, not that"
10ij1bl,You are not alone!
10ij1bl,We always called it swamp cat when we had to work outside in the heat.
10ij1bl,Lolllll sorry
10ij1bl,All you need is a little Pat of baking soda on your underwear and wear black leggings like a new day from target. No smell at all and will hide the wet look.
10ij1bl,"Loose joggers seem to be the trick as well. I love the born primitive brand rest day joggers- they‚Äôre my favorite and hold up so well. Much better than stupid lululemon joggers that made me look like I pissed myself. Or for tight leggings I like bombshell brand- it‚Äôs a thicker soft fabric that hides the swamp crotch pretty well. Or
Shiny leggings hide it well. I‚Äôm still experimenting!"
10ij1bl,LMAOOOOOO ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
10ij1bl,HAHAHAHA!!!
10ij1bl,Dying ü§£ü§£ü§£
10ij1bl,OMG
10ij1bl,"HAHAHAHAHA oh man, I really feel for guys who're decent human beings sometimes. I know it's a vanishingly small group. But still, just imagine being trapped with the rest of them all the time, would you not want to just move to the woods or Iceland or something. Though even Iceland wouldn't help, I've seen their football shouting and bankruptcies. A houseboat. A tiny house way away in the woods."
10ij1bl,Thank you for that story. Got my husband to go that now too!
10ij1bl,"How about thinning hair on the topsides? Wtf is that? Happened when pregnant with my son. Oh god, it‚Äôs getting worse!"
10ij1bl,"Not the person you asked, but I had that a couple of times on my underboobs and OTC lotromin cleared it right up."
10ij1bl,Probiotics help too.
10ij1bl,"swipe your folds with some tea tree oil, witch hazel, or good ol' vinegar as a preventative measure."
10ij1bl,"I have large breasts, and have always gotten rashes if I sweat much. If caught early, keeping  extra clean helps lots. Deodorant mostly keeps it away (I use spray, others work but have residue). Also keeps me drier, though not dry enough some days."
10ij1bl,Yes! Pineapple makes it all taste and smell nice.
10ij1bl,"OP mentioned borax, hence why her bits can now kill ants üòÇ"
10ij1bl,BV??
10ij1bl,"Taken orally? Omg, Isn‚Äôt boric acid toxic? It‚Äôs used in detergents."
10ij1bl,"It's not a cure, but it does help alleviate symptoms temporarily. BV is a bacterial infection, you need antibiotics to cure it. 

But the boric acid does help. Kind of spendy in my area tho."
10ij1bl,Ooooh what urea lotion to do use? I've just been scoping it out on Amazon for my knees-to-feet zone!
10ij1bl,"Get on a cpap. You will find new flatulence you never thought possible. Seriously. I can easily lose two inches in the morning just because of the forced air that made it through. And, they aren‚Äôt all nothing scented."

10ij1bl,A FAN FOR ALL SEASONS omg
10ij1bl,Yep I have a handheld paper fan in my purse at all times
10ij1bl,Little USB powered rechargeable fans! Amazon has them for around $20. My favorite has two battery packs so I can swap them out and charge them.
10ij1bl,"One of my fav YouTubers has a paper fan a viewer sent her that she shows off sometimes. It‚Äôs gorgeous, and has ‚ÄúWAP‚Äù written across it when you open it üòÜ.  On her show it‚Äôs known as ‚Äúwe are professionals‚Äù (she‚Äôs a lawyer) but the original meaning still holds true!"
10ij1bl,"Ooh, is it Dove or having an aerosol that helps? I have just been using perfume a places outside of the usual but curious!"

Lume for me works, on winter days when I'm not sweating my guts out.  I hate the fact that Crystal has aluminum in it and I would love to find another solution.  It just sucks, I really hope this is not the case when I come to post menopause.  I'm in peri now."
10ij1bl,The mineral one is just salt with no aluminum.  That's the one I use.
10ij1bl,Good to know thank you!  I wont waste my $ as it would end up being quite expensive.  The Undercarriage stuff I‚Äôm using seems to be sufficient.

10ij1bl,"I have that.  Old scar, extra 40lbs,  The fat just hangs over the scar."
10ij1bl,Word.  Me too.
10ij1bl,"Yep, good ole c-section scar."

10ij1bl,I read this two days ago and have had random bouts of hysteria ever since. I can not stop laughing about these comments ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÜüòÅ
10ij1bl,Ugh we‚Äôll Lume kind of smells like vomit to me when you apply it initially especially if you get the unscented one. Ironically. But it does leave a weird after smell that is distinct to lume. So then you smell like lume. Which I personally do not like the scent. I prefer to sprinkle a bit of baking soda on the OUTSIDE of my panties. Don‚Äôt get baking soda any where near your inside of panties or labia or you will prob get a bad yeast infection or burn that sensitive area. But on the outside of your panties just a sprinkle and a tap. It takes all smell away all day. Every day. Been doing this for 40 years. No issues. And no smelly snatch or pants. üôÉ
10ij1bl,Same!
10ij1bl,I really love the solid deodorant from method man or Donna Karen‚Äôs cashmere mist solid deodorant. Both are wonderful. Really work well and no acrid after smell. Try maybe.
10ij1bl,This comment is hilarious and even moreso because it came up in my inbox and I'm like I know exactly which thread this was from! haha
10ij1bl,I had this chlorine smell the other day. So weird. Lol
10ij1bl,It‚Äôs not just me! There have been a few times I have wondered what smells mothbally and then I realize it‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm mothbally.
10ij1bl,Right? WTF is this shit? I take care of myself and try to keep things clean and natural and started to smell like mothballs and sweaty socks.
10ij1bl,"Lowered estrogen can sometimes heighten previously existing ADHD symptoms in women. Many menopausal and perimenopausal symptoms overlap with ADHD such as brain fog, forgetfulness, rejection sensitivity and many others, so consider a screening if you do some research and it seems relatable."
10ij1bl,Low dose testosterone cream was amazing for my brain fog!  I had started to think I was getting early onset dementia because I was so forgetful. I feel like I regained my IQ when I got on HRT.
10ij1bl,I started using Lume last month and it‚Äôs been life changing for me
10ij1bl,"Lume has always made me smell 100x worse, but their intimate wipes really do help the undercarriage scent on me from that fold between thighs and vulva. I just use them in the morning and once during the day at work and by the time I'm at home I'm just normal end-of-day scent and nothing that smells especially food-based! I'm so incredibly sad that's a win for me these days! Omg."
10ij1bl,Holy cow are they really $30 a container?? I just quick Googled it.
10ij1bl,I will check them out again. That is good news. A few years back. Gag city.
10ij1bl,Yea onions is about right. It's gross and I never smelled that way before.

10ij1bl,"Bacterial Vaginosis. It's a disruption of the pH of the vagina and it can be really hard to rebalance. You can tell you have it if you get a thin, grey, watery discharge and a very strong odor."

10ij1bl,"Boric Life on Amazon is reasonably priced.  I‚Äôve been using it for 5+ years and have never needed antibiotics,  it has cleared it up every time, and my Dr.  Is good with me using it.  I‚Äôve been able to keep BV at bay with this stuff,  it‚Äôs life changing."
10ij1bl,"I use a drug store brand in Europe. It's 15% urea. I also have a 5% bodywash (wish it were higher, but that's all they have). I love the brand. It's cheap (~$3) and really good. I can't imagine spending so much $ on special, expensive ""anti-aging"" creams, personally. I'm super lucky, though. My mom never got into beauty magazines, and would warn me to avoid them when I was a teenager, but she'd let me purchase about one/week when we went grocery shopping (pre-internet, basically).  I'm in my lower 40s but I think I can get away with 35.  She's in her 70s but looks 60ish. Nothing fancy is now my life, haha."

10ij1bl,"I'm thinking of getting a collection of paper fans to match outfits. Plus I like the thought of dramatically flicking it out and fanning myself.

10ij1bl,"Can confirm: perfume is not hiding anything. You still smell like high tide + perfume.

10ij1bl,"Good question, I don't know.  I use mine for under my boobs, awning (love that!), thigh junction, etc. so I like that I can spray and not have direct contact my skin.

Aerosols are cooling, so I'd imagine any that didn't sting would give some immediate relief, but for me the Dove 48 hour is the only thing I've tried that works for me."

10ij1bl,"I actually like the smell of (some) of the Lumes, so this isn‚Äôt an issue for me.

I‚Äôm glad you found something that works for you, too!"
10ij1bl,Thank you!
10ij1bl,Thats how I got diagnosed with ADHD. My estrogen left me and took my dysfunctional executives with it.
10ij1bl,"Lume made my underarms smell like onions!  It's something about body chemistry-- it works for some people but not others.  (Oddly, it seems to work on the undercarriage...)"
10ij1bl,"I am so glad I found this reddit !!  Lume made  my body odor worse and I broke out in a rash in unbearable places ! Even in my tummy fat roll aka tummy awning lmao 
Lume reminded me of the old toliet odor blocks you hung inside  the toliet bowl."
10ij1bl,"I would so be willing to send my Lume to someone in the US who wants to try it, I think I have the Fresh Alpine, but the cream in the tube so it's never touched my actual body, you just put some on your hand it apply it that way.  It doesn't work on my chemistry!"
10ij1bl,Can you wear a pad to absorb the moisture?
10ij1bl,My manager had a fungal infection under her breasts last summer. Had to take a few weeks off because they had to actually cut the skin and scrape out whatever mess was under the skin!
10ij1bl,"When I was in grad school we still had Blockbuster Video stores and I ran into my GP doctor there and he did that thing we all dread - ""How's the rash??"" with a gesture towards his chest (I had a rash between my breasts for reasons unknown) and I think that interaction scarred me for life. I cannot even imagine sending pics to my doctor, like forget Tinder, this is my life now."
10ij1bl,"Yeah it really does help with symptoms. You're supposed to use it every day, and on my Amazon 30 pills are like $20, which is a lot for me for a ""sometimes"" problem. 

People may have varying rates of success with BA, which is why I pipe up in these threads when people talk about it ""curing"" an infection. Best it can do is help shift your vagina's pH to levels less conducive to growing the bad bacteria. Maybe that's enough for some people‚úå 

But if someone tries it and is frustrated by an apparent lack of curing, talk to your doctor/gyn, they can help too."
10ij1bl,Blue Sky Clothing Co!

10ij1bl,Could def be my chemistry or my nose. I‚Äôm sensitive.

10ij1bl,"I became an onion too. Lume worked for me for over two years. Then last spring I turned into the human version of an onion bulb. I don‚Äôt think it was the Lume, it was most definitely me."
10ij1bl,Hey I also read about these vitamins or pills you can get that have chlorophyll in them that kind of work like an internal deodorant. Maybe check those out. Burps taste minty so prob body odor will be more mint like lol I dunno.

11274iz,"I saw a meme yesterday that said something along the lines of, *‚ÄúThe older you get, the more you understand the Aunt or Uncle that keeps their distance‚Äù.* (That‚Äôs me and my husband to our families‚Ä¶ both are scapegoats in our families, for different reasons.) 

It made moving away years ago to a warmer climate for our physical health easier, so there‚Äôs that, I guess. üòÜ"
11274iz,"That's unacceptable behaviour from them for sure. My parents and sister-in-law always accommodate my vegan needs and are happy to do so. Likewise, I cook meat dishes for them if they're coming over and request it. Your golden child brother doesn't sound so golden; what a dick."
11274iz,"It sounds like you already know the answer here. 

If you ask once + no response, just don‚Äôt attend. No warning or explanation needed. If you‚Äôre asked why afterwards, say you assumed it was cancelled because you didn‚Äôt get any response at all your question wantimg confirmation that there would be food for you to eat. Set up specific boundaries and stick to them.

TBH, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many daughters a family has or how old they are, they will always be treated differently than the sons. Sons have to do so little, whereas adult daughters are expected to carry the weight of the world on their backs or else will be criticized."
11274iz,"Good for you. It is not a very big ask to
Make sure there are vegan offerings at a restaurant. You‚Äôre not asking for much and if they can‚Äôt do that little bit, they don‚Äôt deserve to have you in their lives. 

I am estranged from my family and making the decision was hard because it was frankly scary. But once done, I felt so free. It was like a weight that I didn‚Äôt even realize I carried was removed. I discovered a lot of things too. Turns out I don‚Äôt hate Christmas. I just hate Christmas with those people."
11274iz,"Good decision. It's not fair to you, your partner, or your brother, so good riddance to them! Sounds like you've tried to be accommodating and they refuse to do the same, at some point you have to respect yourself enough to move on. They'll give you a hard time about it, but you'll feel so much better not being caught up in their nonsense."
11274iz,Peri was a big awakening for me on how much crap I have put up with and really cut people from my life. Family and friends included
11274iz,"Ugh I‚Äôm so sorry and also happy for you to have made this decision. You deserve better. 

And incidentally, as a vegan living in Manhattan, I can tell you it‚Äôs a feat to find a restaurant here that doesn‚Äôt have vegan options. Sorry for the shitheads in your life."
11274iz,"One positive about breaking off for a while is that you learn so many truths about yourself and your relationships with others. 

It allows you to know what you want. It also allows you to realize what you were never getting. 

If you are coming away from family gatherings feeling worse or more anxious than you did before, that's wrong. I believe this because I am particularly fascinated with people who adore and love their parents and post sister/brother pictures. I just don't know what that's like. 

But by menopause, I'd say all of us have put in the years necessary to be able to determine, as sovereigns over ourselves, what we realize we like, and what we don't like."

11274iz,"I did it,  mine were all toxic drama queens. I can't do drama anymore"
11274iz,Family is the other f word
11274iz,"I can totally relate.   I have a 70 year old Aunt who used to live a plane flight away and now lives within driving distance.  I was able to tolerate her once or twice a year but now that she's closer I realized how toxic she is.  She criticizes everything I do, down to how I hold my fork.  She comments on my rosacea every single time she seems me, and my dry scalp.      No just no.  I cut her out.  I will see her at family holidays and thank God she is the only one in my family  like this."
11274iz,"Scapegoats unite! Right there with you. In younger days I blamed myself, got older and realized it was them but tolerated it, in this stage I have zero tolerance for BS and have nowhere left to suppress anything. I wish it hadn't taken so long but better late than never."
11274iz,"When my father died, he was the last person that was the link between my siblings and I. I decided to move 8 hours away. On the day of my move, I went to my brother's house,  said my goodbyes and that I'd call him once I got there and never called any birth family again."
11274iz,"Hugs. I totally get it. I am not the Golden Child but the no-good child, so I understand. I hope you have your own people who act as family to you."
11274iz,"*As long as the important family members needs are met then all is well.*

Wow. That's my family too. I no longer live in the same state as any of them and it's not nearly far away enough!"
11274iz,"Long ago, when I cut ties with my husband's entire family, I read a quote that I hold onto.  I wish I could attribute it to someone, but I don't know where it came from.  The quote is this:  ""You only have one family.  But you also only have one appendix...and when it starts messing with your health, you need to cut it out and get rid of it.""   Sometimes ""family"" is the family you create with your close friends and/or partner, children, etc, and not your blood relatives.  I am so sorry your family treats you this way."
11274iz,Peri-menopause was the beginning of the Low Contact Era for me too. Big boundaries in place and with structure comes stability and happiness.
11274iz,"I went low contact, then no contact with my family being at age 18 and I'm 46 now. My reasons were pretty substantial; it was time to break the cycle of abuse, alcoholism and substance abuse, and it was the best decision I could have made for myself. I could't choose my kin, but I definitely chose my family.

If youre constantly being mistreated (especially as an independent adult), put down, ostracized and you always feel ""less than"" consider it. However! This is no easy thing and it should be a last resort, something to preserve your dignity, safety and mental health. There are a lot of things that come with not having a family origin, so make sure this decision is sound. 

I know for me, it's complicated to explain to people why I don't associate with my family, and it definitely gets to me at times, but it's the only way!"
11274iz,"You're having what I call a ""midlife reassessment"", assessing your environment and the impact it's having on you. It's a positive! I did this with my father and a childhood friend, best thing I did for myself - never looked back."
11274iz,I dropped mine 2 years ago. I‚Äôd already cut off a couple sisters 5-7 years prior. I dropped the rest when I realized they keep the toxic family system in tact. Not interested in relationships with people who bring me down.
11274iz,"You'll feel so much better when you drop that baggage too. As a vegan myself with a million food allergies,  I get it. I have no patience for people who continuously disrespect me. Family are people who are good to you. üíõüíúüíô"
11274iz,It is not true that you have to put up with shit because they are ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù  How would you handle it if it was a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and they repeatedly treated you like your ‚Äúfamily‚Äù does?  Extend the same boundaries you would if it was a toxic person. Remove the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù free pass.  And when they complain you don‚Äôt come around anymore. Be open to seeing them but on Your terms and only if they truly try.  Always have an exit plan and make visits short without excuse that you have to leave early. Good luck.
11274iz,"Dropped my sister 30 years ago, only reason we interact now is to talk about mom who has issues. And by talk, I mean text. Dad died 5+ years ago and mom has dementia and only listens to sister whom I despise. No family for me except my mom's sisters who are amazing. Families can suck, we don't choose them like we choose our friends. My friends ARE my family."
11274iz,"Been down this road with my family, letting go and loving people from a distance is ok. I had to walk away from my twin recently, right after my mother funeral‚Ä¶ something I should have done decades ago. Life is painfully short and too unpredictable to waste it on people that don‚Äôt care about you"
11274iz,"Life is too short for this kind of toxic relationship. I'm sorry they are so inconsiderate and uncaring, and frankly, I'm glad you've decided to prize your well-being (as well as your partner's) by walking away. 

Thank goodness you can choose your family of the heart!"
11274iz,"I‚Äôm
Sorry they suck. I agree it‚Äôs time to leave them in the dust"
11274iz,"Dump 'em. Take care of yourself. And let them figure it out if they want to (don't expect miracles), it's not your job to teach and persuade them.

I hope you left as soon as you saw the menu and went and had fun in the city."
11274iz,"We are estranged from my husband's parents and one sibling, the 'golden child' of his family, after years of toxic behaviour, no self awareness or growth from his parents, yelling, drama, and bad behavior/indifference towards our child. Don't let anybody tell you that you must keep family in your life. Only you know the situation and can break generational curses."
11274iz,"family issues and food issues seem different here. you and your partner are adults and can google the restaurant yourselves and determine if your food needs can be met there. or you can just go and have a salad and a drink. 

also, other than maybe you're more easily triggered by family at this time, what does this have to do with menopause?"
11274iz,"You‚Äôre playing your own part here in this drama, it‚Äôs not just your family. Unless this lunch was for you specifically (like your birthday) then asking about ‚Äúwill there be food for me‚Äù is either childish or passive aggressive - and I can see how you would have fallen into this behaviour pattern. The response should have been, ‚Äúhey brother, excited to see the fam on Sunday, which restaurant did you book, I‚Äôd love to look at the menu online.‚Äù  Instead you‚Äôre going with BUT what about MEEEEE and wondering why they don‚Äôt respond‚Ä¶ This is family dynamics 101, you‚Äôre playing the part of the youngest child, it‚Äôs entrenched even as much as for you to describe it as part of your story. You could have described it only as golden child booked lunch etc, instead you describe the family role everyone plays. I‚Äôm not saying this to be mean, hopefully it resonates and you can potentially look at changing your narrative rather than just cutting them all off. (Maybe they‚Äôre still all dicks but it worth a try)."
11274iz,"Almost every restaurant has something that a vegetarian can eat off the menu. For example a salad and a baked potato. We‚Äôre they buying? Family isn‚Äôt perfect, rarely, and I have a dysfunctional one as well. But after my Moms sudden and unexpected passing, it made me realize that I would tolerate the dysfunction a million times over. Love, tolerance, and forgiveness is my goal. At the end of the day the petty grievances we all deal with aren‚Äôt worth  it. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lonely person out there that would love a family even one with a golden child (most have one). I doubt that‚Äôs the answer you we‚Äôre looking for, but maybe a perspective worth considering. Next time say you‚Äôll pick up the tab and take charge of the restaurant choice. Or just don‚Äôt go. Not worth a break up."
11274iz,I saw the meme and nodded my head as I am that aunt who moved away overseas years ago and hasn't been back in almost a decade.  Sorry to hear it happened to you and OP but at least you have that warmer climate rather than dreary London like me.  ü§£  Some day soon I will be moving to a warmer climate too.
11274iz,"Yup, same here. I would rather have my tiny family sipping Cocoa and reading a book than going to Aunt Sourpuss' Christmas party. Sorry, not sorry."
11274iz,"Random thought: I wonder if it is less about the Peri and more about where a person is at that general age. Like‚Ä¶.I only just started hormones a week or two ago and they are *amazing*. I haven‚Äôt felt this good in *years*. So I wonder if I had started the hormones 8 years ago, would I have divorced my husband? LOL! Like was it the hormones, was it the 20 years of resentment, was it just getting to an age where the kids weren‚Äôt little anymore and I could see the next stage and I really didn‚Äôt want him in it? 

Oof sorry! I went down a path just now. LOL!"
11274iz,This sub is fantastic. I walked away in peri as well. Sometimes you just end up with a shitty family and you have to put yourself first.
11274iz,Thank you for this - I should have known there would be a sub for this (similar situation for me)
11274iz,"I don‚Äôt think this post was about the restaurant but describing the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I think the rant flair might have suited better. But regardless, anyone who comes here is here for support."
11274iz,"Thank you, my first thought was, ""Why didn't you just Google it, or call the restaurant?"", which is probably exactly what her brother thought. We're all adults here. If you have special dietary needs, figure your own shit out. No one should have to accommodate you or hold your hand."
11274iz,"I hate to say this but I agree. I am a fellow youngest child, and I definitely share the sentiment that I'm ""the least important"" and treated as such--but what I've learned is that, yes, I do my part with upholding this role as well. 

If your brother invited you to lunch, I'm sure he told you what restaurant it was. Why didn't you look it up online yourself to see if they had things you could eat, instead of texting him (twice) about it? That is voluntarily putting yourself at his mercy when a simple search would have kept your agency. (And if there was nothing you could eat, THEN you could text him and say ""Sorry, this restaurant has nothing vegan, please choose another or I won't be able to go."")

I'm not trying to be harsh honestly--just that I've been through the same thing. My older siblings get to set rules all the time for family dynamics, and one day I just got sick of it. I enjoy Christmas for family time and companionship, and they all want to exchange gifts. Shopping for gifts is stressful for me, and I really think it's silly when we all can buy ourselves whatever we want (gifts for the kids in the family is fine). So I put my foot down one year finally and said, ""I am not buying gifts this year. Please don't buy me any, either. Let's just buy for the kids and enjoy dinner together."" 

They said ""OK."" Well, lo and behold, I got to my parents' house for our regular Christmas dinner, and they'd ALL BOUGHT ME GIFTS and acted shocked that I had no gifts. 

Luckily--I had a premonition this was going to happen. So I kept my cool and simply said, ""Thank you so much for thinking of me."" And refused to act ashamed. And you know what? That was the end of it. They didn't pull that over on me again...and I am still not buying gifts (except for the kids) :)

Stand your ground and don't play into family dynamics. You can certainly cut them off for good if you want, but if you find that you do wish to keep them in your life, just proceed with the knowledge that you are an adult and you do have agency and they cannot get to you unless you allow it!"
11274iz,Agreed. You played your role in the already established family dynamic. Adjust your behavior too and don‚Äôt play the victim role
11274iz,"Well the place I am is warm, but it‚Äôs become the battleground for US facism right now, unfortunately‚Äî so I actually am ready to leave and trade the warmth to ensure my & my family‚Äôs rights remain intact. ü´†

(I guess we can‚Äôt win them all. üòÇ)"
11274iz,"Same, stuck in midlands tho. Was sunny today at least."
11274iz,"It‚Äôs a thought provoking stage in life. I woke up one day and ended a perfectly good 6 years relationship, everything he did just rubbed me the wrong way when it used to rub me well. Lol. I‚Äôm on HRT, very happy, chilled and looking forward to next stage in life. He would like to reconcile and I miss him, but I don‚Äôt want him back. Maybe we need exorcism ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
11274iz,I think about 40-50 years worth of bullshit from the universe is enough ;)
11274iz,"Ugh if my husband of almost 20 years and I didn't have a disabled adult child to take care of, I would've been gone years ago. It's a frustrating position to be in."
11274iz,"If she knew what the restaurant was, she could do this, but it‚Äôs not clear that she did. How do we know they weren‚Äôt just like, ‚ÄúMeet us at the Washington Square stop‚Äù or whatever? And then they only found out at the last minute which restaurant the brother was taking them to?"
11274iz,"Yes, and not to go on and on because I know I already commented...but even if the brother WAS a nice guy and offered to check on the vegan options, I don't necessarily know if that would even be the best idea. Vegan is not the same as vegetarian, and if he's not a vegan himself, he might not know what to look for specifically on the menu. 

Most people I know with dietary requirements/restrictions very much prefer to check menus themselves, as they know their way around what they can and can't have."
11274iz,"Also, just a gentle suggestion--I'm not vegan, but I have many friends who have very strict dietary restrictions. You can call the restaurant ahead of your reservation and ask if they can prepare you something that fits your needs, and I'm sure most restaurants will be happy to accommodate."
11274iz,"I tried this one year with my family, and would you believe that my MOM said in front of my other family that I decided to be a scrooge and not buy gifts that year?  When we discussed it earlier, she had totally agreed with me.  I was mortified and ashamed.  That was a long time ago, my mom is now gone, and we have moved across the country in order to avoid the pervasive family guilt that comes with not wanting to be with them every day."
11274iz,I've learned that people seem to enjoy buying and giving gifts more than receiving them. So I stress out a little less knowing this.
11274iz,And technically warmer today too.üòâ
11274iz,"Same. Woke up one day and that man *had* to go. Sometimes I shudder when I realize that without the eye-opening shitstorm of meno, I‚Äôd probably still be stuck in that relationship. 

HRT did mellow me a bit, and I‚Äôm glad. Now I can enjoy the non-draining parts of him at minute doses, without having to carry both his life and mine. Total win, if you ask me."
11274iz,"I mean, it's possible, but kind of a stretch. Have you ever gone to dinner with a group of people that was planned days in advance and not known what the restaurant was?

But regardless, the whole premise of her complaint is just selfish. I am a celiac and I would never expect my family to only eat at restaurants with gluten free options. I am not the main character. We go where the majority of people want to go and if there are gluten free options then great, if not I get a salad with vinegarette dressing. So can OP."
11274iz,"Then you just say ""What restaurant are we going to"" not ""will they have things I can eat?"""
11274iz,"A salad is a gluten free option, though, if not a great one. I guess I took OP literally when she said there was nothing they could eat. If there were (not great but passable) options available (like a salad), and she just didn‚Äôt want them, then yeah, I think that‚Äôs a little unreasonable to complain about and I‚Äôd tend to agree with you. 

Idk, when I‚Äôm getting together with people with dietary restrictions, I do tend to plan around them, which is honestly especially easy to do in Manhattan because there are so many options. You‚Äôd have to go kind of far out of your way to find a restaurant with literally no vegan options."
11274iz,Fair enough
10xwphz,"If you live in the South, have also developed a taste for good craft beer, suffer from the walking farts, and would like to try out the joy of pooping in the deep woods with a pack on your back- I need you as a friend. We ladies need to spend more time laughing together about the extra butt hair keepng our hemorrhoids cozy over the winter and the box of mini pads that somehow wound up in the pantry next to the boxes of pasta."
10xwphz,The farting section ü§£ü§£ü§£
10xwphz,"My god, the chin hairs!"
10xwphz,The farting section. Omg I‚Äôm crying this is my life all of it I can‚Äôt laugh too hard or I will pee fart
10xwphz,"OMG, I laughed, cried, peed, and farted in salute to your post!! All hail and salute to you!!ü§£üò≠üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è"
10xwphz,Up and down like a whore‚Äôs drawers - now that is some writing üòÇ
10xwphz,Brilliant suggestion to have tweezers everywhere you go üòÅ
10xwphz,I've had half of these most of my life üôÉ.  Autism and adhd added to it. Well I guess I'm gonna have a great f time! Hahaha
10xwphz,">  Try Aldi caviar anti-wrinkle cream and learn to apply make up in the dark so you don‚Äôt have to see the naked face in the mirror.

Instructions unclear. Did this in the dark and ended up with black spots all over my face. :(

Oh...wait. Caviar *wrinkle cream*. That explains so much."
10xwphz,"I need flair that says ‚Äúwire hair saggy granny fanny‚Äù. 

Thank you for the good laughs today üíù"
10xwphz,Thinning hair is a thing too
10xwphz,Nailed it üëå
10xwphz,"Who originally wrote this?  It kind of sounds like a meno vlogger I've seen, just curious."
10xwphz,It‚Äôs not seen this before. It‚Äôs awesome!
10xwphz,"The facial hair!!! I have tweezers with every set of readers that I have. Car, office, end table, bed side."
10xwphz,This post should be pinned.
10xwphz,This. Allllllllllll of this. Dear gods.
10xwphz,"The farting is so real! My husband and I both have this problem so now when one of is rips ass walking up the stairs, bending over to leash the dog, or bending over to get in the car we just say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre adorable!‚Äù"
10xwphz,"THC helps immensely for anxiety, sleep, pain. Doesn't help with hair though, sorry."
10xwphz,This is amazing! Thanks for the laugh!
10xwphz,"The eyebrow hair, this growing a beard along with my pubescent son, the itching and worrying about whether it‚Äôs body lice or microscopic bedbugs or liver failure‚Ä¶ wow. I‚Äôm relieved my asshole is primed for the anal sex I never wanted and it explains it all. I‚Äôd take all of it if I could just go a few days without the anxiety, insomnia and hot flashes and worrying about whether or not this was early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. Spot on."
10xwphz,"My mother in law always says ‚Äòwhat you lose on your min, you gain on your chin‚Äô. Haha I shall look forward to that."
10xwphz,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, This helps me so very much. I lost my Mom last year and don't have anyone to talk too. 8 honestly thought I was going crazy"
10xwphz,"Having to pee in the middle of the night, ruining my sleep‚Ä¶"
10xwphz,I laughed and cried at this!! üòÇüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
10xwphz,"How about snoring?? Anyone else a freight train at night? I thought it was just the weight gain, but my skinny ass friends do it too."
10xwphz,This is the BEST thing I've ever giggled my way through!
10xwphz,It‚Äôs hilarious - I had to share it
10xwphz,This was... beautiful. I definitely have saved this post for reading again later when I'm in the middle of any of these.
10xwphz,"Bingo for me! I won a good laugh, thanks!"
10xwphz,"I need this on a pillow.  Haha!  This was absolutely brilliant and very on point.  It made my day, so I thank you for that. ü§ó"
10xwphz,Thank you for this. Read it to my 22 yr old daughter! Bwahahaha
10xwphz,This is hilarious and so TRUE!!!!!!
10xwphz,"Sorry if this is ignorant (early 30‚Äôs here, still childless), but are the things you said about your pelvic floor true even without having kids? I knew that was possible after childbirth, but I didn‚Äôt know menopause could contribute as well."
10xwphz,"I found a lovely solution for the itchiness: a dry body brush. Get one with a long handle, teach your so the proper pressure and motion so they can brush your back. I keep mine by my bed and use it often. It‚Äôs a little much at first, but after a few times it feels heavenly."
10xwphz,This made me laugh so hard! I absolutely love it!
10xwphz,OmG yes!  Farting!  I feel like that‚Äôs the one symptom no one else talks about much üòÜ
10xwphz,OMg that was so funny I shared with all my friends: thanks for making me laugh -I was just ready to cry due to morning anxiety.
10xwphz,ü§£ü§£
10xwphz,This is so hilarious and true thanks for the laugh
10xwphz,"I also live in RSA ! ü§£
Can‚Äôt beat our humour"
10xwphz,"Rutin has saved my asshole several times from the dreaded hemmorroids. Don't know if it works for everyone, but within a couple of days the itching and discomfort goes away and they shrink down again."
10xwphz,">hemorrhoids

please tell me this is not menopause related. Please"
10xwphz,"My husband asked what was so funny, yep, tears running don my face and the farting section

The sneeze fart, my son said this is called ‚Äú your body taking a screen shot‚Äù 

Tooooo funny"
10xwphz,I'm still crying.
10xwphz,"Yes, but does your SO/spouse actually sit there and claim you DON'T fart, because they've never heard it (never mind that mine doesn't wear his hearing aids when he's home half the time and yet it happens ALL THE TIME)?"
10xwphz,ü§£ü§£
10xwphz,I bought a tiny Swiss Army knife keychain because of the handy tweezer and scissors.
10xwphz,Same here! Got confused and now my face smells like a Russian prostitute!
10xwphz,You can definitely customize your own flair here.
10xwphz,"This broke me, I'm crying laughing ü§£"
10xwphz,Hair where you don‚Äôt want it and not enough hair where you do want it:  Brought to you by Menopause.
10xwphz,"I have no clue 
Was sent to me by a friend 
Too funny not to post 
Wish I was that creative LOL can‚Äôt take credit for writing this"
10xwphz,Agreed. A+ work here!
10xwphz,"45, no kids, and unfortunately it is absolutely a thing."
10xwphz,"Yes, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be a life sentence. There are things you can do to resolve pelvic floor problems or even help prevent them in the first place. Go see a pelvic health PT/physio, and they can help you! Anytime is the right time to go. It‚Äôs never too early or too late. üíú"
10xwphz,"I use a dry brush too, all over my body, before every shower! ‚ÄúHeavenly‚Äù is right!"
10xwphz,Well that's a bummer! Thanks for a much needed laugh my flatulent friend!
10xwphz,"I‚Äôm sorry, but I feel compelled to point this out. If you‚Äôre from SA, you know your user name is racist, right?"
10xwphz,"Lol no, just a subtle reminder of my son's breech delivery 23 years ago. Steve (my roid) is definitely enjoying the extra peri-hair though, this is the first year he's staying warm in his new nest."
10xwphz,"Worked from home this week until today, and the moment I stepped onto the sidewalk, walking past a man taking his kids to school, an audible fart slipped out. I was like *really?!!*

Next time I'll look him dead in the eye and say ""Well pardon YOU!!"" and wave my hand in his direction."
10xwphz,SHE DID IT! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10xwphz,"It‚Äôs not! 
It means person in Zulu :) 
It‚Äôs my number plate on my car too :)
AND you assuming I‚Äôm white !"
10xwphz,"My wasting menopausal muscle tone has resulted in my pregnancy hemorrhoid taking up permanent residence outside of my body. This, along with the tumbleweed of hairs that surround it now, results in having to use half a roll of TP every single time I poop. What I have saved on tampons I am now spending on massive amounts of TP. Like I need one more thing to rage or cry about. Fuck menopause."
10xwphz,I cannot stop audibly laughing because I have Steve‚Äôs cousin Mitch who is well nested within the nethers of Butt Cheektopia.
10xwphz,"Ohmygod is that why it takes so much more toilet paper to wipe when I poop now???? Honestly, I've felt like I've forgotten how to wipe lately and I've been seriously doubting my capabilities as a functioning adult because of it."
10xwphz,OMG you make me laugh üòÇ
10xwphz,"I know right? I finally bought some baby wipes and use those from time to time. First the tp, followed by the wipes."
10xwphz,Cold water helps :)
1117egv,CONGRATULATIONS!üéâüçæüéäüéà I am so amazingly happy for you (as is every woman on earth enduring peri!).
1117egv,"Congratulations! How are you going to celebrate? When my time comes, I'm going to buy a new mattress to replace this disgusting blood stained one."
1117egv,I was period-free for a year or so when my uterus took one last trip down memory lane. üôÑ But quitting bleeding is easily the best part of this next phase. ü•≥
1117egv,Congratulations!!! At 56 yrs old I'm still having periods regularly. Late to start (14 yrs old) late to finish I guess
1117egv,Go ahead and update your flair to whatever you want!
1117egv,Congrats!!
1117egv,Congratulations!!!
1117egv,"Happy day! I am glad you can celebrate and own it, in spite of the downsides."
1117egv,Congratulations!
1117egv,"Yay! Congratulations! üëèüèª that‚Äôs one thing that makes me sad about having had a hysterectomy. It was in 2016, a little before turning 45. Still having regular periods, though they were very heavy and found out after surgery it was adenomyosis. Right a year after I started feeling really bad so I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs when peri started. (I kept my ovaries). So now it‚Äôs been almost 7 years in peri, but I don‚Äôt know how to know when I‚Äôve passed over into post menopause ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I‚Äôd really like to know. I‚Äôm on estradiol injections so I can‚Äôt go according to my FSH."
1117egv,Happy menopause to you!!  ‚ú®üéÇ‚ú®
1117egv,This is awesome!!
1117egv,Yay! I love how you're celebrating. Here's to no more Aunt Flo
1117egv,Congratulations!
1117egv,Congratulations üéâ
1117egv,Happy menopause day to you!
1117egv,Congrats!
1117egv,Congratulations
1117egv,Congrats & thx 4 sharing!
1117egv,Wahoo! Happy Menopause Day!
1117egv,Been sane but I had a hysterectomy! Love no periods. My first time wearing white pants
1117egv,So awesome! And what a relief! The thought of it makes me think of the huge relief when I got each of my sons potty trained.
1117egv,Congratulations and welcome aboard!!üçæü•Çüå∫
1117egv,"I used to mark whenever I got my period on the calendar, but honestly have no clue when my last one was. Once I started skipping them, I just figured ""okay it's probably over"" and stopped thinking about it. 

Then the doc asked, and I couldn't give an answer. Since I started my period the day of my 13th birthday, I'm going to guess it stopped on the day of my 53rd birthday, and go with that."
1117egv,"Happy your day to you! Enjoy, friend, and here's hoping the ""fresh new problems"" are minimal. :)"
1117egv,Yay!!!!!!
1117egv,Happy menopause day!
1117egv,And its your cake day too üéÇ
1117egv,Congratulations!!!!!
1117egv,"Valentine‚Äôs Day will never be the same. Welcome to the other side. It‚Äôs pretty good over here. And BTW, you can prevent and manage some of the potential upcoming challenges by making mind body shifts that support this phase in life. Congratulations."
1117egv,"That's so funny...hubby and I were talking about new mattresses today! I would love to celebrate that way, but instead I bought myself an expensive pair of ugly work shoes (yeah me). It was nice not sliding around slippery floors at work, so yeah me."
1117egv,"Yikes! Yeah...that would be getting really annoying, like when will you be done?"
1117egv,"Same. They are months in between, but still showing up"
1117egv,"Actually almost 6 years in peri, not 7."
1117egv,FSH test told my doctor I was done....
1117egv,"We always called it ""my friend "". She was a bitch,  but some friends are like that."
1117egv,That's a good gift! And Happy Cake Day!
1117egv,Happy cake üç∞ day!
1117egv,I've no idea!!
10w6sap,"Don‚Äôt get rid of your concert tees yet! 

Unless they‚Äôre collectible and have value to keep them the way they came, just do some DIY to the neckline so they fit your new shape. (I did the same in the past year‚Ä¶ tutorials for this can be found on YouTube.)"
10w6sap,"Wait, you mean these things are here to stay?  I hope I am just getting chubby from winter and peri.  I've always been a weak B cup and athletic formed, now I'm doughty and my boobs are too big!"
10w6sap,Wait‚Ä¶ menoboobs are a thing?
10w6sap,I wish my boobs got bigger!  Mine have completely deflated.  Wasn't a big deal back when I had a flat belly.  Now I look like a ski slope.
10w6sap,"I simply can‚Äôt accept them, I‚Äôm asking for a reduction because no way am I living with them. They re huge, tight and feel like they are splitting, can‚Äôt be touched and disgust me. I found it amusing the first few months of one big them not then the other big then not and now ever growing they are just disgusting loafs of suet hanging like a udder."
10w6sap,"Don't throw anything our yet. If they are like mine, they will go up a cup size and a half, feel bloated for 5-6 years, and then revert back to their former size... albeit saggier because of the lost volume. 

Peri is an asshole. Big boobs? Not for long. Flat belly? Here, have this spare tire! High libido? Not anymore. No more periods? Here's a bloody surprise! Expecting a full night's sleep? Here, have three hot flashes in a row! I wish that jerk would just move out and get his own place."
10w6sap,Good for you! I'll wear my tops stretched to the max but it's time for me to cull the bras. Thanks to meno I've got more range of sizes available than a lot of department stores. I just don't want to face it.
10w6sap,"Yeah, i had mine surgically reduced. Back pain on 36G is no joke, and often covered by insurance."
10w6sap,"You've inspired me to finally go bra shopping! I've just been living in sports bras the past couple years, telling myself I'd lose the weight in warmer weather like always. I did lose 10 lbs, but I think the extra 2 cup sizes are here to stay.

I'm sitting here squeezed into a Brains tshirt that my armpits are trying to eat, while my belly is tucked into elastic waist mom panel jeans üòí.

I was lamenting today about how much I miss wearing leggings/ yoga pants. And all the black and leather I used to wear. And keeping my long hair down. I take meds for hot flashes but they still happen, just less severe/ often. Wearing the old stuff was suffocating during flashes. 

Also all my piercings started getting more...cheesy and requiring more frequent cleaning due to all the sweating, that I just gave up and removed them. That nipple ring was older than my kids! It felt like the end of an Era, sad yet liberated. I seem to have to reinvent myself every 5 years, I'm about 3 years into this peri evolution and curious to see what emerges from it."
10w6sap,"If you like French blouses, you should try French bras! Empreinte, Louisa Bracq, Aubade, etc. For me, Empreinte bras fit like a glove and make my boobs look just like the model‚Äôs. The French know how to construct a support garment. 

Check out the ‚Äúa bra that fits‚Äù calculator and reddit community. Get those new boobs in some fantastic new bras! https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php"
10w6sap,Omg. Mine are big and saggy. Soon my 2nd chin will be where my boobs used to be and my boobs will be at my stomach (upper stomach!? lower stomach!? - place yer bets). üò≠üòí
10w6sap,Crap I hope not. I'm already a 42DDD.
10w6sap,I‚Äôll take your shirts. My boobs refuse to grow no matter what. My butt though‚Ä¶
10w6sap,"Yes I agree, it‚Äôs like in menopause and post meno, you get the more apple shape. I‚Äôve accepted the new shape but just trying to stay healthy."
10w6sap,"Ugh‚Ä¶I‚Äôve got meno boobs, even after a lift and smaller size surgery. They got bigger afterwards. They are in the way lol. I‚Äôve handled my own rebellion by throwing out all of my underwire bras and I no longer wear padded ones. Nip covers as needed. And I found that Free People makes tops that can be worn as a bra that are cute and supportive!"
10w6sap,"Your boobies got huge too? I'm still in the diagnosis stage but my boobs won't stop getting bigger and I'm not really gaining weight anywhere else üòÖ. I was also a late bloomer, I literally prayed to God for bigger boobs."
10w6sap,"I‚Äôve just gone up a size in everything after dropping massive amounts of weight several years ago - 

It‚Äôs been a challenge - all new bras and underwear this week has definitely felt ‚Äòright‚Äô 

Next step is to take away everything that makes me feel like I‚Äôve squeezed into a sausage casing 

I just don‚Äôt deserve to feel like shit in my clothes. ‚Ä¶

Hope you replace your stuff with stuff you love üíã‚ù§Ô∏è‚ùå"
10w6sap,I'm making an appointment to have mine removed. They're just in the way now. No babies to feed and they make my back hurt. Always with the rashes and boob sweat. I'm just done with them.
10w6sap,"Don't get rid of them yet! I don't know where you are in peri or if you're post menopausal but the boobs might change again. 

Mine got so much bigger and acquired a funny shape (joke's on me, literally). I struggled with bras, threw out all the old ones and bought new ones. I thought this was my new forever. I can feel my hormones are finally settling down, and my boobs are shrinking. I've gotten back into my usual exercise, have been eating better and have lost a little weight, so that also contributed. I'm so relieved, but also hello stretch marks, you bastards. 

Your mileage will vary but it's possible you might be able to wear those blouses and Ts again."
10w6sap,I can empathise I also got meno boobs I always wanted big boobs until now!! They just get in the way & no bras feel comfortable.I‚Äôm also in the same process of sorting my closet out I have a big pile to go but haven‚Äôt actually moved said pile yet as I‚Äôm finding it hard to except.
10w6sap,"Man, I hate mine and I refuse to get rid of all my concert t-shirts collected over the years üòÜ

My problem is mostly in back fat and belly pooch. All my hand shirts are medium‚Ä¶ some of them still fit ok but it‚Äôs not the same. üòî 

Im saving all of them for two reasons: my mom dropped an epic amount of weight in her 70s after she had to quit drinking for health reasons, so I know it‚Äôs possible lol. The other: quilts! I will pay someone to make some quilts if I never fit into the shirts again. ;)"
10w6sap,You should find a way to display your concert tees!
10w6sap,"I already have big boobs and don't want them to get bigger, ugh."
10w6sap,"It's the skin-to-skin contact that really grinds my gears. It's uncomfortable to be braless now, and that's just wrong."
10w6sap,"I was just thinking about posting here to ask what people are doing with the clothes they're fairly certain they will no longer be fitting into.

I'm planning to do some upcycling. I sti love my things. So, I'm going to rework them. My boobs are okay. My waist, hip and thigh area have grown. My upper arms are chubbier.

I'm going to take the clothes I have and make new magic with them."
10w6sap,"This.
I have such severe body dysphoria. I‚Äôve gained 30kg very suddenly without doing anything different, except for having a hysterectomy."
10w6sap,Make sure you check your size with the [abrathatfits calculator ](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php).  Over 80% of women are wearing the wrong size.  A correctly fitted bra make s a big difference in how your clothes fit and how your body looks and feels!
10w6sap,"Guurrrrrrl SAME!!!! Went through my closet & drawers because these giant heavy meno boobs aren‚Äôt going ANYWHERE. Thrown into surgical menopause 6 months ago, rapid weight gain, and going up three cup sizes. It‚Äôs ridiculous! But I think instead of fighting it and being miserable, I‚Äôm choosing to work with it. I‚Äôve thrifted a few cute and comfy items that I really like. I don‚Äôt know about you but I REFUSE to wear tight or uncomfortable clothes now. It‚Äôs not happening. I went to a bday dinner tonight in a tshirt dress, jean jacket, with my checkered vans. And I actually felt cute!"
10w6sap,"I hope not. I'm still hoping i lose some of it. 34G's are not fun. When I did a DEXA scan (fat, muscle, bones), my boobs fell onto my tiny arms and results showed I had extra fat on my arms. You can clearly see with the scan pic, it's my boobs!"
10w6sap,What kind of concert t shirts do you have? I collect them and would be more than happy to purchase some from you.
10w6sap,R UR boobs bigger w hrt or without? Im same 1 yr no. Cycle
10w6sap,I have meno pancakes. :(
10w6sap,There‚Äôs surgery to reduce breast size
10w6sap,Oh hmm. I wonder if this is why my boobs seem bigger
10w6sap,"I‚Äôm doomed if mine get any bigger. I‚Äôm a 42 F. Please just, no!"
10w6sap,"As a former cyclist, I can attest that becoming a cyclist will reduce your boob size, guaranteed. I don‚Äôt know what it is about that activity in particular, but it‚Äôs a well known thing. Probably just the insane amount of calories it burns when we do 5 hour rides, I guess.

Another woman I used to ride with had boobs that were so uncomfortably large she‚Äôd been saving up for surgical breast reduction before she took up cycling. By the time I met her she was around a normal C cup. Mine went from DD to C as well."
10w6sap,"Kinda ON topic, but with these bigger ta tas, has anyone experienced itchy patches on them?"
10w6sap,"At least in some cases, when breasts ""keep growing"" and you're an adult, it's a water issue, and there are Chinese herbs, like Restore the Right Kidney, that can ""fix it"" within days."
10w6sap,Omg I might get bigger boobs!?!? That‚Äôs almost a silver lining to this bullshit.
10w6sap,"Really? I will have a look, thanks üòä"
10w6sap,You described me friend ‚Ä¶
10w6sap,"My weight gain and superboobs were from a combination of peri and thyroid failure. Although the thyroid meds have stopped me from putting any more weight on, *nothing* has helped it come off. I love the new boobs, but sure do wish they had been like this on my athletic 30s body!"
10w6sap,Yeah I thought same when they first started ballooning. Surely this is temporary‚Ä¶. Apparently not and I‚Äôll hack them off myself if refused a reduction.
10w6sap,"Yes! For 1 in 5 of us:

https://gen-m.com/symptom/increased-breast-size/

I‚Äôve gained some weight in my abdomen too, but it‚Äôs mainly been in my breasts. It was the same for the women on my Dad‚Äôs side of the family, I believe I must have inherited it."
10w6sap,"I‚Äôm sorry üòû 

This peri is no fun"
10w6sap,Same same. No boobs.  I did manage to get my belly flat tho (fasting and no gluten).
10w6sap,"This is what I try to explain to people who tell me that ""getting big boobs sounds like a good thing!"" They aren't big sexy Playboy boobs. They're like big veiny ugly grandma boobs."
10w6sap,Plus the back pain.
10w6sap,"OMG OMG OMG they will deflate? THEY WILL? 

Please God let mine deflate! They just keep getting bigger! I have gone from a small B to almost a D. I HATE THEM. Please tell me honestly they WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL EVENTUALLY???? When I was pregnant, they blew up to a D then went back to a B as soon as I stopped breastfeeding."
10w6sap,üòÇ I‚Äôd gladly kick peri out on the streets ‚Ä¶
10w6sap,"I‚Äôm happy to hear this! 

Not sure I would get such a surgery covered - I went from a fluctuating B Cup to a very full D. I guess time will tell."
10w6sap,You should venture on over to r/ABraThatFits to make sure you're getting sized correctly in stores.
10w6sap,ü§û
10w6sap,"OMG this gives me so much hope. 

Big boobs are by far the worst thing about menopause for me. 

Weight loss isn't touching them. In fact, I'm pretty strictly dieting and exercising lately, and I can see weight coming off my stomach, but the boobs are getting even bigger."
10w6sap,"Doesn‚Äôt make any difference, but I am early stages of HRT.

Birth control always made them huge ‚Ä¶"
10w6sap,"Not for me ‚Ä¶. big time cyclist here.

I‚Äôm actually recovering from a cycling accident and had to have major surgery. I lost loads of weight due to the surgery, but my boobs remained. :("
10w6sap,Yes! Especially in Summer
10w6sap,I do retain loads of water
10w6sap,I just looked that stuff up. It works on water retention? It shrinks boobs? I'll buy out the entire country of China's supply if so
10w6sap,"It‚Äôs not as fun as it sounds - it‚Äôs not like it comes with a meno-boob lift.

And they hurt a lot ‚Ä¶"
10w6sap,plus t-shirt quilts.
10w6sap,"Babe, put backing on them and turn them into a quilt or wall hanging."
10w6sap,You‚Äôve given me hope. I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing. I need to lose some weight but I‚Äôve been afraid of what it would do to my chest. Last time I lost weight they looked so bad I gained some weight back on purpose. I‚Äôm in peri now at 47. My mom said she went up a cup size when she went thru menopause and I just thought she was nuts. I‚Äôm going to diet and pray.
10w6sap,"I want meno boobs. Poor A cup that got to experience the joys of a C cup during pregnancy and breastfeeding. When done breastfeeding, they always go back to an A. On the positive, almost 41 and my boobs look great and I love them. I just wish they were a little bigger so my stomach didn't look so big."
10w6sap,"Yup. None of my nice bras fit me anymore. Thank god there's 
r/bigboobproblems !"
10w6sap,Sorry if TMI but my nipples have gotten bigger too and have lost some of their pigmentation. I don't know if that's happened to anyone else.
10w6sap,"Those are people who also view their life through the lens of ‚ÄòI am here for a man to enjoy‚Äô ‚Äòa woman‚Äôs purpose is only for man to use‚Äô which further enrages me tbh. They‚Äôll deny it of course, otherwise they‚Äôll realise they‚Äôve been a penis doormat their entire lives."
10w6sap,I‚Äôve only just noticed how my posture has morphed into trying to hide them the last year. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm bothered to undo the damage or peri anymore
10w6sap,Mine went up a size and I couldn‚Äôt figure out whether it was the back fat or the boobs but none of my bras fitted me anymore. Now back to normal thank Goodness. The pain a couple of times when someone hugged me was intense. Felt like a cow with udders.
10w6sap,I was a decent b and now must be a D and hate my body so much right now. I‚Äôm asking for a reduction cos I‚Äôm not risking them staying.
10w6sap,I can‚Äôt recommend this community enough. I finally started wearing the right size bra about 2 years ago and it‚Äôs really helped my confidence - especially as my body changes.
10w6sap,Thx i never took bc b4. Ps ur beautiful no mattee what!
10w6sap,"Oh goodness. You‚Äôre a medical marvel, you are! I do guess you‚Äôre stuck with the bangers then."
10w6sap,"So sore. All the time. If I actually manage to fall asleep, you can bet I‚Äôll roll over onto my belly and squwish a boob and yowee! I‚Äôm awake again."
10w6sap,Yeah they're like pregnancy boobs...sore and achy
10w6sap,Dammit.
10w6sap,"I‚Äôm not that crafty, but good idea"
10w6sap,"You can have mine, I hate these things :("

10w6sap,Me too. It‚Äôs been slow and I am due for a mammo this week. Going to mention it. I thought it was my imagination until you posted this so thanks.
10w6sap,"On that note, my husband does like them. He also likes my bit of weight gain...crazy man."
10w6sap,"Aw, thanks lovely. You too! üòò"
10w6sap,And itchy!
10w6sap,I think there are people on Etsy you can commission to make one for you!
10w6sap,"Oh they are so easy! And there are plenty of people who will do it for you on Etsy. Pillow cases too! Just if you go that route, please read their reviews before trusting them with vintage shirts."
10w6sap,"Or if you wanna go full rocker chick, cut the t-shirt into a patch and sew or safety pin it onto a jean jacket or tote bag"
10w6sap,Ugh same. I went from a D to an H with breastfeeding and they never went back. I want a reduction so bad.
10w6sap,"Yeah, I am a fair-skinned blonde so they weren't very dark to begin with, but they've lost so much color it's odd :("
10w6sap,There is a company that makes t shirts quilts and employs veterans only. Offers a lot of mental health counseling too I believe. Project Repat maybe? I have used them a bunch.
10w6sap,"Also, as a fellow lover of band tees, Redbubble has sooooo many designs and their Relaxed Fit T-shirt style has a lovely scoopy neck for the meno boobs and actually sleeves to cover the bingo wings. I have a ridiculous number of these t-shirts and they are my wardrobe staple."
10w6sap,"I only got three days breastfeeding and my current size is easily as big as I got then. Not enough milk, so they got like coconuts for a few days and then deflated back to normal, just a little softer. Having 40 pounds jump on my chest and stomach hurts in so many ways. I‚Äôve seen comments here that it gets better, I sure hope so because exercise does absolutely nothing. I may consider reduction myself. Uuuuugh."
10w6sap,I will look that up and give referrals to it! Thanks for the info!!!!
10p2voq,"My menopause doc, advised me to ‚Äútreat your vulva like you treat your face‚Äù 

So I‚Äôve been applying lipstick and mascara for weeks, but no improvement‚Ä¶

Joking, obvs. She meant no harsh soaps, perfumed products etc. and moisturise daily."
10p2voq,I was today years old when I found out I need to moisturize down there.
10p2voq,"I learned that I was post-menopausal from this sub. Love it here, so much info and support. 

Recently, I went in for a wax and my aesthetician told me my outer vaginal lips were dry. I laughed and said I‚Äôll add that area to my list to moisturize.  
Now I carefully apply cerave cream on the outside area only and I‚Äôll add some estrogen cream there too on my vag estrogen days.
This sh$t never ends."
10p2voq,"I did not find that out until Dec 29th, 2018. Exactly 365 days from my last period - I googled stuff because I thought, now I‚Äôm in menopause.
Wrong! Found out that you don‚Äôt know your in menopause until you are finished menopause because you‚Äôre always waiting for another period during that year. 

I cried that night, totally unlike me to cry over something like this but I felt betrayed, like I was mislead. 
10 months later I started HRT and I‚Äôm still on it."
10p2voq,"Yep but I had to find out for myself, like basically everyone does. Been in peri 11.5 years waiting to start missing periods."
10p2voq,Will the debasement ever end. Being a woman is a pain in the vulva. I can't believe I have to moisturize my pussy. Hilarious honestly. The things I didn't know about becoming an older woman would fill a library!
10p2voq,My undercarriage has a more elaborate beauty regime than my face
10p2voq,Vaginal moisturizers work their way down and cover the entire piece of real estate.
10p2voq,"If you‚Äôre using a vaginal estrogen cream, you may not need to apply an additional moisturizer.  Likewise, if you‚Äôre using an estrogen cream, use a tiny bit to moisturize your whole business.  Including your ass.  Seriously, that dries out too.  Don‚Äôt ask why I know, just that I do."
10p2voq,Hair conditioner for the small bits of hair. Works for me!
10p2voq,It has been 494 days since I had a period. I had a party at 365 days.
10p2voq,Menopause is just a bitch no matter what
10p2voq,I was not told this at all. So you ladies use coconut oil?
10p2voq,Moisturize it with what
10p2voq,"*for info purposes* 

(ETA: the doc did not say anything to me about external moisturizers. All of the below pertains to internal only.) 

I went to see an ob/gyn I found through the NAMS list last week and she advised that I start using an internal vaginal moisturizer. She said these are typically used 2-3x a week. I said I didn‚Äôt know this was really a thing and she said yes. 

She said lubes, on the other hand, are for episodic use (sex, play, exams, etc (?)).

She gave me a list of nine internal vaginal moisturizers with the ingredients of six (the last three she wrote in at the bottom). (Full list at end. I‚Äôm sure there are more out there.) 

These are for vaginal dryness (internal) as an option that is not estrogen-containing (Rx).

The first six, the ones with ingredient lists, all have water or purified water as first ingredient. 

Common second/third/fourth ingredients are carbomer, glycerin, propylene glycol, mineral oil, aloe.  So, moisturizing ingredients. 

One has Yerba Santa in it (Eriodictyon spp ‚Äî this is a plant that is native to California and other northwest states. I actually grow one in my backyard. Apparently it can be used similarly to aloe.) 

Note: list she gave me is not all encompassing. 

Also, I‚Äôm sure many of these have generic versions? I certainly hope they do anyway, because these are all about $15 a month at least, it seems like. Each box appears to be about a month‚Äôs supply ‚Äî but not if used everyday. 

Replens Vaginal Moisturizer (there is also an ‚Äúexternal comfort‚Äù product and a lubricant, but this is the vaginal moisturizer, internal) Amazon price is $15.47 for 14 applications (one applicator for reuse; 1.23 ounces; 2-pack is $35.33)

Moist Again (lol sorry for those who hate the m word) (also, not finding on Amazon)

Vagisil Feminine Moisturizer (not to be confused with anti-itch cream or wash, etc.) (Amazon price is $14.56 and box says ‚Äú24-day supply‚Äù; 8 prefilled applicators; there‚Äôs a 3-pack for $39)

Feminease (not finding on Amazon)

K-Y Long Lasting Moisturizer (not jelly!) (not finding on Amazon)

K-Y Silk-E (not finding on Amazon; K-Y Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer comes up; 6 ovule inserts and 6 disposable applicators. This is a moisturizer and a lube? Hmm. Makes me wonder if it would be more messy? Don‚Äôt know. $29.93; 3-pack for $54.18)

Luvena (Amazon price is $21.99 for six applications; a pack of 2 is $33.24)

Hyalo Gyn (looked up on Amazon; uses hyaluronic acid; price is $17.99 for 10 applications.)

Revaree (WHOA. not sure why but this is quite pricey on Amazon. $130 ü´£ for 10 suppositories.)"
10p2voq,That is in the wiki page in this sub.
10p2voq,My wife has a balm I found for her called Vulvacare and it‚Äôs very nice she like it a lot.
10p2voq,"Good Clean Loves has several moisturizing products. I use the Restore gel and hyaluronic acid gel. I find the Restore gel lasts all day, the other is good for shorter periods of time."
10p2voq,"I hear Replens is good for that, like, apply daily to keep the natural moisture going. Haven‚Äôt tried it yet though"
10p2voq,So I use estrogen cream...do I need moisturiser too?
10p2voq,Love Mona Eltahawy‚Äôs work!!!
10p2voq,"Where are you moisturizing? Inside? Outside? How do you know if you need to? Honestly, this is such a surprise!"
10p2voq,Coconut oil is the best!
10p2voq,"It might sound gross (and is not appropriate for vegetarians), but emu oil was a life-saver when I was getting my lichen sclerosis under control. Maybe I should start using it again‚Ä¶."
10p2voq,Just sending love for all the chuckles I got!
10p2voq,"Coconut oil I bet would be good for it too, it‚Äôs great lubricant and great for skin too"
10p2voq,Awwww. Fuckitall. I‚Äôm barely starting out (maybe 2-3 years heavy periods and hot flashes.) Y‚Äôall keep scaring me with what‚Äôs coming next. üòÇ
10p2voq,Well my waxing technicians told me that many ladies are having Botox on their vulva to make it look more youthful‚Ä¶ so yeah they really treat their vulva like their face‚Ä¶
10p2voq,I had no idea!!!
10p2voq,"I use aloe vera gel which works for me, the 'purest' one I can find. (Though not good for people who are sensitive to latex)"
10p2voq,"This sounds a little unscientific.  There are various estrogen medication which you can use vaginally for dryness and atrophy, but moisturizing?  I think that might cause more problems than it solves."
10p2voq,"Beware of steaming , I think ?! I didn‚Äôt know wtf when I happened on a room full of gals [yoni steaming](https://www.wildwoodbirthpdx.com/yoni-steam) I put it out if my mind until just now üòÇ"
10p2voq,What in the hell? Is this for real? Sounds like a quick way to get a nasty infection if you ask me.
10p2voq,"A wise man once said: ""You gotta moisturize your situation to preserve the sexy. ""

Prophetic, that P Diddy was."
10p2voq,"My gyno told me that after peri comes menopause. That post menopause is slang and medically, every day from that one year mark on is technically called menopause. I've looked online and there are lots of sources saying that but others that say different so who knows."
10p2voq,"Replens is cheap and readily available, although I don't use as much as they recommend in one application (2.5 ml? Seriously? I don't need to leave a slug trail, I can  find my way home). Most importantly it's pH balanced for your lady cave and designed to help it retain moisture. The moisture you are missing from your vulva came from your vagina in days of yore. Don't just put anything in that area, you're asking for trouble."
10p2voq,Emu oil. Learned about its soothing and therapeutic uses (on vulva) from the lichen sclerosis group!
10p2voq,I just use whatever lotion I‚Äôm using for my body - usually Jergens. I apply it daily!
10p2voq,"I use Julva from The Girlfriend Doctor (Dr. Anna Cabeca) 
Great stuff!"
10p2voq,My gyno suggested the simplest method use olive oil when dry
10p2voq,My gyn gave the ok for Vaseline.  I don‚Äôt use it daily - just as needed.
10p2voq,Membrasin works WONDERS ! There is a supplement to take by mouth and a cream to apply to the vagina.
10p2voq,If your in HRT everything stays good - no need to do anything - things just work and stay moisturized- we all need HRT
10p2voq,"Vitamin E cream, ona‚Äôs estradiol, and Indian Meadow Herbals skin healer salve have all worked great for me with no issues"
10p2voq,">	So I‚Äôve been applying lipstick and mascara for weeks, but no improvement‚Ä¶

Been there. Getting the mascara out of the pubes is a nightmare."
10p2voq,"I've got the cat eye, down pat."
10p2voq,"How do we moisturize daily though? I keep everything away from that area except my vaginal estrogen suppository and water when I shower, because I‚Äôm super sensitive (even a tampon string these days makes my labia feel like it‚Äôs on fire after a while).

Any recommendations for what works & is safe (and won‚Äôt contribute to a YI or BV or UTI occurring)?



üö® EDIT: 

With all of the recommendations I‚Äôve been given (thank you all), I‚Äôm going to buy a bunch of what‚Äôs been suggested and I am going to write a review! 

I‚Äôll update with a separate post when I finish trying what I buy. Thank you to everyone who has shared ideas."
10p2voq,I've got a beard on mine! ;-)
10p2voq,Omg. Y‚Äôall made me spit my coffee. üòÇüòÇüòÇüíÄ
10p2voq,"Can confirm. I've eased up a lot (haven't used it in weeks) on my Premarin. I don't like how it's made. I'm using Vulvacare moisturizer I got off Amazon, and I found I can get away without the Premarin and still not end up with an atrophied vag. I need a menopause doc. My GYN never told me about this, even after I complained that sex hurt and I was getting a lot of UTIs. And she's a woman, you'd think she'd be a wealth of info. I guess she hasn't gone through menopause."
10p2voq,I don't moisturize my face daily.  I think it likely neither prevents nor causes skin aging.  But if it's uncomfortable (on the face I mean but wherever) feel free to moisturize.
10p2voq,Lol. Good one.
10p2voq,Ha this made me laugh!!!!
10p2voq,"I agree, what fresh hell is this?  I‚Äôve got to add coochie cream to my morning routine?"
10p2voq,"Same same. I've only just learned how to take care of my hair (on my head I mean), and now this. Ffs."
10p2voq,"i‚Äôm just like‚Ä¶ and WHY do i need to do that?

sounds like something someone made up to sell overpriced moisturizer if you ask me."
10p2voq,Same!
10p2voq,Ain't it the truth.üôÑ
10p2voq,"I have super-chapped lips for some reason, but not *those* lips!! Even with coconut oil balm, my lips are always dry-looking. Even THIS is annoying."
10p2voq,Can you recommend an estrogen cream?
10p2voq,Wow. So sorry. Hope they stop soon. ü•∫
10p2voq,"I want a menopause library!! 
I also think we should have a global menopause campaign to demand governments to put more research into treatments and medicine. The non hrt options for those with cancer risks are horrendous."
10p2voq,üòÇ seriously!?  Can we use conditioner or do you actually need moisturizer
10p2voq,"I know this is not politically correct, but I'm going to say it anyway. A certain group with a bunch of letters (the first being L) stated that anyone can have a period, including those that don't have a V because periods are a state of mind. 

I kind of beg to differ. The bleeding, cramping, vomiting, swollen breasts, the ache when the egg bursts out of your fallopian tube (Mittelschmerz), followed by peri-menopause, and the menopause where we actually have to moisturize our female bits, goes way beyond a state of mind. It's pretty much a pain in the ass that I wish was a state of mind so I could just meditate that crap away."
10p2voq,"Oh my, what all do you do down there??"
10p2voq,Lol
10p2voq,Real estate! LOL
10p2voq,"I use a suppository but I fear it‚Äôs not enough. I‚Äôve avoided the cream estrogen because I worried it would feel wet or sticky. But even with the OTC stuff I think I‚Äôm going to have to deal with it. Ha ha.

And yes to the back end also getting dry! In the shower I had a pinch one day that felt like a paper cut back there. I do lotion that area now‚Ä¶ never thought I‚Äôd be doing *that*. üòÇ"
10p2voq,Perimenopause is a bitch.
10p2voq,I do. Use it as a lube too.
10p2voq,Thanks so much for your comprehensive list!
10p2voq,"I thought I read it, but I might have forgotten all about it."
10p2voq,Seems its an American thing.sadly
10p2voq,Just yesterday I got the aloe vera water based and tried it. I ended up with itchy dry eyes and a sensitive skin around my vulva. I took a shower and will try again in a few days. Perhaps the hyaluronic acid one would be better for me.
10p2voq,I use both. It doesn't hurt to keep everything as moist as you can.
10p2voq,"I do both. The atrophy mainly affects those delicate tissues inside. That's what can make sex painful. For two years I thought I was getting constant UTIs. Then through my own research I discovered vaginal atrophy (thanks for nothing GYN). Your tissues thin and dry out causing tears particularly after sex. It. Is. So. Miserable. If you have it, you will know. Sex becomes really painful. My moisturizers (Magic V and Vulvacare) say to use it externally. I ignore that and use it inside as well. Even my GYN said everything looked nice, pink and moist."
10p2voq,"I second the emu oil. I use it daily, so comforting and effective"
10p2voq,"Pfffttttt if you are having super heavy periods -- I was forever but didn't realize mine weren't normal -- look into getting a Novasure (ablation). Best thing I ever did IMO. I had one or two incidents in peri where I absolutely GUSHED blood at an alarming rate and that scared me into looking at what could be done. Scheduled OB/GYN visit for a transvaginal ultrasound, qualified for the procedure, had it 2 weeks later and it was done in a flash. No more bleeding ever. Cant recommend it highly enough."
10p2voq,"I had the heavy bleeding for about 8 to 9 months before the final one. I think. Maybe a year? I was like, really? I have to buy more tampons now? I could never find the SUPERSIZE ones alone, only in a multipack. I still have so many tampons. üòë"
10p2voq,Botox inserted in the vulva? üòØ
10p2voq,"At my recent appt with an ob-gyn I found on the NAMS list, she did (to my surprise) recommend a vaginal moisturizer. She said lubricants are for penetration (sex, play, gyno exams). Moisturizers are for use 2-3x a week.

She gave me a list of ones she recommended (with ingredient lists!) and she gave me a couple of samples. üôÇ"
10p2voq,Lol. Does he really have that lyric in a song? üòÜ
10p2voq,I‚Äôm hearing ‚Äúmenopause transition‚Äù now.
10p2voq,I agree with this. Play around with the pH down there at your (possible) peril.
10p2voq,"Thanks, but : ''Emu Oil is extracted from the thick fat on the emu's back. To remove the oil and the surrounding fat, the emu has to be killed. Although edible, emu meat is considered pretty unappetising and tough ‚Äì so emus are really only being 'harvested' for cosmetic oil purposes.'' I am against killing animals in general so I won't be using that. :("
10p2voq,Not to mention all the contouring and eye shadow layers.
10p2voq,"Gluing the false eyelashes to my labia majora wasn't as flattering to the minora, as I thought it might be."
10p2voq,üòÜ
10p2voq,Cat eye for the kitty
10p2voq,"You could try this vulva and vaginal moisturizer: [https://purepharmacy.com/products/feelamazing#](https://purepharmacy.com/products/feelamazing#)

It's priced in Canadian dollars and they ship internationally. Plus, on Wednesdays, Pure Pharmacy does customer appreciation day with 15% off. Or, you can get 10% of by using the code MENOPAUSE CHICKS"
10p2voq,There are a bunch on Amazon. Look for something with Buckthorn Oil. It's clinically proven to help with atrophy. I use Vulvacare and Vmagic. I use them internally as well as externally even though they say they are not for internal use. Maybe you should look into a cream rather than a suppository. I used a cream for a while.
10p2voq,I use coconut oil - I am very sensitive and it‚Äôs the only thing that doesn‚Äôt make my vagina very angry with me
10p2voq,Double base Gel - in the UK. A gynae gave it to me originally but its available over the counter now. Doesn't smell good but really moisturising and lasts all day.
10p2voq,"Ask your gyn, I think. They might be able to recommend or even script out a safe moisturizer?"
10p2voq,"I use AloeCadabra every other day with no irritation, applying it with a reusable applicator I got off AMZN."
10p2voq,"I've been using organic hemp oil, which also doubles as lube. I also have a very sensitive vag and vulva."
10p2voq,Try the Carlson Key E suppositories.   You can cut them in half.    They are great IMO.  Coconut oil and vitamin E.
10p2voq,My obgyn said coconut oil or vitamin e oil.
10p2voq,"Carlson - Key-E Suppositories, 30 IU Vitamin E Suppositories on Amazon. Every Single Day. They‚Äôre very inexpensive too."
10p2voq,There's actual vaginal moisturizer on sale.
10p2voq,"Try a moisturizer specifically formulated for the vulva. I use VMagic from Medicine Mama Apothecary. It was recommended by both my uro-gyno and Pelvic Floor PT. It is all natural, organic and has no chemicals or fragrances. It moisturizes and soothes."
10p2voq,What type of consistency is Vulvacare? I use V Magic and it‚Äôs a bit like Vaseline. I‚Äôm not totally happy with it as sometimes it makes me itchy.
10p2voq,"I wish it was just about marketing.

Dryness down there can lead to lessened amounts of good vaginal bacteria, and that imbalance can put you at risk for increased incidents of UTIs (and I think also increased risk of BV and YI).  üò©

When I first started noticing the dryness I welcomed it because it was better than years of having to change my underwear by lunch! Ha ha. But then my doctor said the dryness was why I had been probably getting so many UTIs. Vaginal estrogen seems to help a bit, as can a good probiotic, but those aren‚Äôt always enough because the good bacteria need a good bit of moisture to survive.

In looking online, a lot of the things made for vaginal moisturizer don‚Äôt have nearly as many ingredients (one or two it seems in most cases) compared to typical OTC lotions or moisturizers (it‚Äôs a big difference)."
10p2voq,"[M.A.C. cosmetic brand lipglass](https://www.maccosmetics.com/product/13853/255/products/makeup/lips/lip-gloss/lipglass-clear?gclid=Cj0KCQiA8t2eBhDeARIsAAVEga1Q0DPh3BH7cj-Z08phYy52UxcDZ7lJO07oZUvx8aqwRkKcyx7BhwcaAswlEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). It's **worth the price**. I just buy the clear stuff. (But you can get many different colors if you wish!) It is better than any medicated chapstick -- in fact it makes chapstick look like dogsh\*t. It doesn't dry up and it heals the skin. 

It works so well that my husband (who has way worse chapped lips than I do) went out and bought himself his own M.A.C. lipglass! His lips were so bad that they were bleeding. Within 24 hours, the lipglass healed him up. He carries it everywhere now."
10p2voq,"I used to use lipbalm like 12 times a day. I got diagnosed with a slew of contact allergies. Now that I only use Vaseline, I only use it around twice a day."
10p2voq,I changed my brand of toothpaste and now - no more chapped lips!!

10p2voq,Me too ü§™
10p2voq,"I use coconut oil, available in the cooking oils aisle. üòÅ"
10p2voq,"Geez, you should have just not said it. I know several trans people and NO ONE has ever said periods are a ""state of mind"". You know it is possible to discuss our own problems without denigrating others?"
10p2voq,"I‚Äôve never hear anyone from the LGTBQ+ community say that. 

I‚Äôm not trying to argue or attack, and I mean to add my thoughts in only a helpful way. 

I‚Äôd suggest to very carefully consider the source where you heard the claim about ‚Äústate of mind‚Äù.

Is it from someone respected by the LGBTQ+ community- and would they be considered by the community to accurately represent a shared community belief? Because to suggest that a whole community feels this way, on a very surface level of ‚Äòlogic‚Äô seems much too broad. No community is entirely a monolith, so I tend to think that one person would not speak for all- especially where something so personal like individual physical experiences are concerned (which seems especially important, since the community is typically a champion for individual physical rights- so why would they all of a sudden want to paint everyone with a broad brush where periods are concerned?).

Or is it more likely that the information was coming from someone who claims it was said, and you‚Äôre getting it via a third, fourth, or fifth, etc.-hand account, that you can‚Äôt trace to an original source? 

I‚Äôve been through similar conversations with my parents, as they modernize and learn more about different communities; I‚Äôm trying to not be pedantic, and I am trying also to be kind: Please consider that there is rampant misinformation spread about the LGBTQ+ community regularly, and there is ALWAYS an agenda attached that is ALWAYS founded in discrimination. Please question your sources; ask for proof of their claims that you can read or see/hear from where the claim originates. That should help to avoid inadvertently (hopefully not intentionally) supporting discriminatory claims."
10p2voq,"I've never heard ""periods are a state of mind."" Also, your wording re ""a certain group with a bunch of letters"" is so dismissive, you come across as a homophobe, which is super gross."
10p2voq,All of it. Lol is a bitch
10p2voq,"You bet! I have to say, I‚Äôve been to one Walgreens and argh. No generic vaginal moisturizers. 

But then I was thinking and while I don‚Äôt like having to pay a (possible) minimum of $15 a month for a vaginal moisturizer, what are the risks of not treating it? üòï

(Also: If this isn‚Äôt considered FSA/HSA reimbursable, I‚Äôm going to feel sooooooo‚Ä¶ worked up.)  ETA: (I say worked up because ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure how to effectively advocate to change it. Damn it.)"
10p2voq,"An all too common occurrence around my house. I just found a chicken that I thought I'd put away after shopping‚Äîin the pantry with the cans of tomatoes‚Äîand, yep! The can of tomatoes was in the fridge.

No chicken dinner round these parts!"
10p2voq,I think some of the main ingredients are buckthorn oil (also in Magic V) and coconut oil. Maybe you can make up your own. Bummer they don't have it where you are.
10p2voq,"Oh no! I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. Be careful, am allergic reaction in our nether regions is never fun. 

I hope you have a better experience next time ‚ô•Ô∏è"
10p2voq,Like sandpaper‚Ä¶no one told me either.
10p2voq,Broken glass is how I describe it
10p2voq,"I don't think so, I think he said it in an interview or something, lol. I giggle when I think of it."
10p2voq,Wasn‚Äôt it an commercial for Proactiv?  My husband and I used to repeat that at random times.  Thanks for the memory!
10p2voq,üòÜ

10p2voq,Sure‚Äîbut did you teach it to wink when you did?
10p2voq,"Wow, thanks for this!"
10p2voq,This product is my holy grail. Could NOT recommend it more.
10p2voq,"Just looked up what other options there are besides V Magic which is what I use. And learned that there is not one but two types of ‚Äúlipstick‚Ä¶.‚Äù lol!

10p2voq,"Good suggestion, but careful with that coconut oil ladies, test it on a less sensitive area first. Some people are deathly allergic and do not know. I‚Äôve seen an allergic reaction on the face, and cringe to think of that happening to someone‚Äôs vadge."
10p2voq,I have the opposite reaction to coconut oil.  It burns!  I started more research and found articles recommending people with skin rashes or allergies to try it elsewhere first.
10p2voq,"I use an ointment I found on Amazon. Vulvacare. Ironically the texture of a ‚Äúlip‚Äù balm, but it works great. Keeps the nether regions from being itchy or irritated."
10p2voq,"Oh! What are the chances, but I just bought a container of that yesterday for something else health related! üòÜ I‚Äôll give it a try; thank you."
10p2voq,Coco butter any good?
10p2voq,Yes coconut oil!  I put it on at night like lotion on my hands etc. It had helped a ton
10p2voq,"A question about ‚Äúmoisturized all day‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not noticeable though, is it? My estrogen suppositories have made sex with my husband noticeably better and easier, but other than that they don‚Äôt make me feel icky.

I‚Äôd like to be moisturized, but not feel wet or sticky. I actually loved the dryness of perimenopause for a little while (until the UTIs). Is that awful? Dry underwear is just much more comfortable! üòÜ (I always had a healthy cervical mucus in the past but don‚Äôt want to go back to changing underwear by lunch, like the old days.)"
10p2voq,"Where do you find that?

I shop a lot on Amazon, but after a few instances of supplement bottles having the protective seal broken or missing I am weary of buying things to apply/ingest from there. (Especially concerned if it‚Äôs going to effect my vag! üòÇ)"
10p2voq,"Those are good. I've used them, but it got to the point that I entered Sahara desert territory and they just didn't cut it. I finally went to Premarin then  Vulvacare and Magic V. But it's nice to know that are several things we can try.  I've learned more here than withy my GYN."
10p2voq,"Thank you for the recommendation.

Can I ask about the urogynecologist? 

Is it really worth it to get one? Are they that different than a urologist?

My gynecologist gave me a referral for a urologist because I‚Äôve had almost ten UTIs in about 3 years. But I learned of urogynecologists recently and was wondering if that would be better than a standard urologist. (All of the urologists in my area seem to be men too‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think there will be much getting around that, either.)"
10p2voq,"Sadly, VMagic gave me a wicked yeast infection :/"
10p2voq,VMagic caused me to develop a nasty yeast infection!
10p2voq,"that‚Äôs *vaginal* moisture, not *vulva* though - those are two completely different things. 

OP‚Äôs talking about the vulva - which, c‚Äômon, really?"
10p2voq,"Oooh this is great, thank you!"
10p2voq,Does it not bleed into your lip wrinkles?
10p2voq,"I use that at night, during the day I'm applying the oil/lipstick/repeat. Might have to carry Vaseline around and try that."
10p2voq,"A good suggestion I got from somewhere was to apply moisturizer (lips, skin) when the skin is wet (with water), as saliva is actually drying.  I've been taking sips (or more) of water before applying lip gloss or whatever and I've found it does help."
10p2voq,Ahh I'm kinda stuck with the sensitive-tooth toothpaste though :-/
10p2voq,I know it‚Äôs going to happen soon. üíú
10p2voq,"I saw it on Insta. The Norway-based LGBTQ+ group called Trans Cultural Multinational Alliance, TCMA, posted:

‚ÄúYou do not have to bleed to have a period.

You do not have to ovulate to have a period.

A period is a state of mind than a state of being.

Transgendered women have periods and therefore need free hygiene products.‚Äù

This along with some other ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù posts (remove the song Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin from Spotify, don‚Äôt assign gender to your pets) and after serious backlash are now claiming they are a satire group.

It‚Äôs sad that we can‚Äôt trust the legitimacy of so many things we read anymore."
10p2voq,"I agree, but I don't miss the bleeding part. What really sucks is, when the bleeding goes away for good and you can go, ""ah"", your body goes, ""LOL, bitch, now I'm going to throw weight gain, a big belly, facial hair, immediate wrinkles and a bit of vaginal atrophy in for grins and giggles. Have fun!"""
10p2voq,"I'm in Ireland so I might be having problems getting these, but maybe UK amazon will have some."

10p2voq,"The doublebase gel is not noticeable, no. It just sits on the skin very comfortably."
10p2voq,At my local natural foods store. You can find it in a lot of places in Ontario. Brand is Manitoba Harvest.
10p2voq,"And a LOT of fake products that look authentic on Amazon now,. It‚Äôs a huge problem with skincare and other personal care products. If the seller isn‚Äôt the manufacturer, be careful!"
10p2voq,Same here.  My GYN spent about 10 minutes with me if that.    I also pushed for estrace cream thanks to this group.
10p2voq,"Since they specialize in female pelvic floor conditions, they have more specialized training in female pelvic anatomy and conditions. My urogynecologist is a female, which I much prefer. She treats conditions that a urologist treats and more."
10p2voq,My older sister went to someone (don‚Äôt know the name of their specialty‚Äîphysical therapist?) who do pelvic physical therapy and she thought it was great. She uses an estrogen ring for extreme dryness.
10p2voq,"I‚Äôve lost all skepticism after having dealt with beginning stages of atrophy in the first few years of perimenopause. It ends up affecting a lot of us:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30601037/


Besides the UTI annoyance and discomfort, when the worsening dryness affected my ability to orgasm and I started requiring lube with my husband just so I wouldn‚Äôt tear and be in pain, I knew I needed to do something. I‚Äôm lucky I can take vaginal estrogen, but it‚Äôs not a cure for everyone. I‚Äôd advise anyone in our stage of life with these parts to pay close attention to everything down there and definitely to the clitoris and urethra- keep them moisturized to keep the tissue healthy because the condition of your tissues (good bacteria, elasticity) is what will help prevent infection and discomfort. (Clitoris and urethra ARE *vulva* health. See here: https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/vaginas-101 )

I appreciate this conversation and think it actually highlights how disadvantaged we are by the lack of study of perimenopause and menopause historically. Because we should focus on our entire ‚Äúvulvovaginal‚Äù health, but that‚Äôs a term that we rarely hear. ‚ÄúVaginal‚Äù  (internal) health seems to dominate discussion in standard magazines or websites that will touch the subject; and actually, a lot of places that discuss ‚Äúvaginal‚Äù (internal) health use ‚Äúvagina/vaginal‚Äù to encompass the parts of the vulva too, which is another disservice, since we are benefited most by being medically accurate (it helps to articulate the problems properly so our concerns are taken seriously)."
10p2voq,You're welcome! If there's an Ulta store near you -- they carry it!! Go to their MAC section and it's right there with all the lipglass.
10p2voq,Actually no. People use lipglass over their lipstick to circumvent that.

I clicked on a few profiles that interact with that page and what turned up was entirely unsurprising. Lots of hate represented; quite a few white nationalist types as well."
10p2voq,"LOL. Dude. Is this the same group that tried to start a rumor that trans people were protesting the song, ""You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman""? It's a joke/parody thing. Stop believing all the ridiculous shit you read online."
10p2voq,"And then, she will freak you out by telling you body to display every PMS symptom you have ever had, but not bleed, so you think that you are loosing your mind.  

I felt like I was right back into the throws of perimenopause,  but with no period. I was such a wreck, I scared myself!"
10p2voq,"Oh I hope so. I haven‚Äôt tried any yet, but they sound helpful."
10p2voq,Do not leave a potential side hustle on the table!

10p2voq,"There are groups that claim to be advocacy, comedy/satire, or opinion pages that ‚Äúplay‚Äù on Devil‚Äôs Advocate type stuff when it comes to LGBT or race concerns that are designed to look legitimate in order to suck people in, but are quite hateful. They intentionally try to fly under the radar to grow their numbers. It‚Äôs one way so many people have been sucked into certain types of health/medicine/science theories through the idea of ‚Äúwellness‚Äù in the past few years; the hate groups know these methods too.

I teach my teenagers to look into everything, especially if they come across it online. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but also a responsibility to be careful with what they share and spread willingly."

110tuvp,This ad is part of a pharmaceutical campaign promoting a non-hormonal medication for hot flashes/night sweats that is still in FDA Approvals. Apparently they will find out late this month if they are approved. I expect it will be very pricey unfortunately.

110tuvp,"Yep.  Seeing more newspaper and magazine articles popping up and now this.  Menopause is definitely having a moment!

3. Lots of medications are the gold standard until something better comes along."

The Galveston Diet is capitalism at its finest. 

I'm not against capitalism, btw! Good for her"
110tuvp,"Yes well it's too late for most of us, as the need to start dealing with symptoms was years ago.  There are also risks to new medicines that don't show up immediately as well, so it's not always best to be an early adopter.  So yea Gen X really missed the boat on this one as our generation has with pretty much everything it seems.

And women do need to be warned  they still will need to use vaginal estrogen if they ever want to have sex again.  Mind you I use that and still can't have sex much of the time."
110tuvp,Gen X is actually leading the way on this one? It‚Äôs actually those of us now in Menopause and Peri Menopause that are instigating this ‚Äòmovement‚Äô.
110tuvp,"GenX is anyone born between 1961 and 1981. I was born right smack in the middle. So we are definitely right in the middle of peri and menopause. We also, sadly, learned the best of capitalism from our boomer parents"
110tuvp,"I was born in 75.  I've been in peri for 4 years now (might well be post menopausal now but definitely not done with symptoms), extreme hell symptoms (ok the hot flashes are some what controlled but the insomnia and vaginal atrophy are bad) and clueless doctors for 2 1/2 years now and on HRT for 2, and feeling abandoned by the medical system and struggling the whole time.  Abandoned and struggle that's the Gen X experience in a nutshell, from the having to raise ourselves when we were children onward.  My dad was WWII gen (greatest gen), my mom a silent gen."
10j6uez,"I relate to this except I don't have things. I will probably live in my car when I'm too old to work. I don't have a child or a family. I'm just me, going through this time by myself. 

There is still a lot of shame around women who are no longer fertile. Society doesn't want them. People don't respect them. This is misogyny. You just don't realize it when you are young because you rely on your youth to keep you buoyant. Reality is difficult and heavy. The worst part about aging as a woman is the feeling that you're disposable."
10j6uez,"I hear you. I'm still trying to figure out how to have better energy. I used to do a physical labor job and was proud of what I could do. Meno took all my energy away suddenly and now what? It's been hard on my self esteem because I aged ten years in five. It's hard not to say well SHE doesn't have the problems I have, why has it hit me so hard? Trying to avoid certain pitfalls but it seems overwhelming."
10j6uez,Absolutely how I feel also minus a child. The loss of just so so much is devastating. The fact this blindsided me like a fucking ( completely unprepared) train is just incomprehensible in -ha- an educated society.
10j6uez,"Ah, that golden menopause commune sounds simply heavenly!

I‚Äôm adding that to my list of ‚Äúthings to do if I win the lottery‚Äù: set up menopause refuge space with sheepskin rugs, and the comfiest, slouchiest, couches and poufs to put your feet up on (not beanbags, they‚Äôre too hard to get out of sometimes lol).

I feel a million times better since I got all the treatments I needed. It‚Äôs been 13 years since I went into early peri aged 35 - didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with me for so many years, unhelpful doctors galore - but I finally started feeling better last year.

The sheer privilege I have is always so much at the forefront of my mind. I live in a country with subsidised healthcare, and yet still our doctors are so ill-informed that I had to spend time researching and $300 for an appointment with a menopause specialist by Zoom. I haven‚Äôt had breast cancer and am not high risk, so I can take the (subsidised) hormones. I live in the same city as the one - yes, ONE and only - pharmacy in my country that imports testosterone cream, and I have a treasured prescription for it. I spend ungodly amounts of money keeping my hair and skin looking young which helps my self esteem, I have the skills, time and tools to make clothes that fit my new shape because store bought ones simply don‚Äôt anymore. I have a job where I can work from home half the week, which helps save time & manage energy, and means that I could work all day in my pajamas today without anyone realising!

It is not lost on me that any one of these things will be an insurmountable hurdle for so many women who just have to ‚Äúput up with it‚Äù. It‚Äôs unfair and awful."
10j6uez,I am in agreement. Lost in transition.

Love her.  She's going through so much and needs the support.  And she's hurting but brave af because she keeps trying."
10j6uez,"Yo, not for nothin, fuck this stage of life. I've been in peri seven years now, and no one gets it. I'm not Oprah. No woman in my family said shit about this. First I thought it was some eastern European cultural shit, but the women I've spoken to IRL whos mother didn't come from a foreign country, all say the same. no one says shit. There's no Jedi Knight for this shit.  It's like, Gen X is the forgotten generation for *EVERYTHING* for real. 

God, if men went through this it would be a national holiday or something. 

But it's shameful to talk about it, especially when you start going through this *before* your 50s."
10j6uez,"I'm holding my heart reading all of your words.  In this moment I feel surrounded, held and so seen - maybe more than ever.   This experience has ripped off my skin,  my soul is screaming - you better be vulnerable or you'll take yourself down.   I listen to you and I think - if we could crawl out of our caves we could start a movement - then I think, right, more doing, more movement, more big dreams.  

So, you did fly in my fairy godmothers! Here we are.  Love, big ass love, to you all.  Maybe I will write my book, on the days my fingers will cooperate with my brain."
10j6uez,"I feel this so deep in my bones. 

I don't know what the answer is because I'm so new at realizing what I'm dealing with is probably perimenopause, but what haunts me is that I feel like a shadow of who I was.

> I am so scared of this new person, ***how viciously I would have judged her.*** Everyone says, there's wisdom in this time, lean into this time of quiet and slowness. How? Where's the off switch? I've built every inch of my life around being able and independent (and really quite spendy).

I would have too. I \*am\* viciously judging myself. The negative self talk and criticism is brutal.

I am struggling with all of this. I understand so little of this phase in life. The question I am asking internally is should I be embracing this as the inevitable march of time, and any struggle is just going to be futile and damage my psyche by trying to fix what is unfixable and can at best be eased? Am I better trying to learn to accept this?

Or do I rage and fight for who I was and am and could be again with every fiber in my being? Do I gnash my teeth and give biology the middle finger to be the person I know myself to be? 

I'm gen-x. We are gen-x. We were the ignored generation, the latch key kids. We also were the slackers that did things our way and we are the ones that said fuck the system and fuck the boomers. Fuck the old ways. 

I am on the side of raging and fighting this and finding a new way of dealing with perimenopause and menopause. I don't know enough yet, maybe my mind with change as I do or as I realize those options are off the table. Maybe this desire to fight is just denial and this rage is grief.

I am going to try to get my hormones replaced and be the person I have seen evaporate over the last two years. I don't know how that will go or what I will do the rest of my lifespan, but for now, I am going to try to reclaim myself for who I know I am, and if it takes modern medicine to do it, then fine."
10j6uez,I told my doctor I feel like a completely different person. I don't like her much and I miss the old me but she's not coming back. I feel like changing my name. Cause that person's gone. I have arthritis in both my knees so the only exercise I can do is in the pool. So with Covid I have been so afraid even though I'm vaccinated to be in a humid environment working out. I can't sleep and I get migraines from lack of sleep. I'm so full of resentment from years of allowing myself to be a doormat. It's all just too much.
10j6uez,"Saturn, the Lord of aging, decline, and deterioration, is feared and dreaded for good reason.  And most of us here live in a culture that values youth, individualism, and wealth.  It makes it all so much harder and difficult to find new joys and any sort of wisdom or value."
10j6uez,"I'll tell you what helped me. Going for long ruminative walks by myself. Just put on some shoes and walk out the door. Hopefully you live in a neighborhood with some remnants of nature to commune with.

It's a difficult time, menopause. Our value to the society that likes the young and the energetic and the beautiful has diminshed. We no longer turn heads. We no longer hold a certain kind of power. 

So now what? Now, maybe we look at that society and decide we never really wanted to play by its rules anyway.

Who were you before puberty when you grew breasts and hips and suddenly the world wanted to have its way with you? What did you like to do? You are still here. Get back in touch with that girl"
10j6uez,"We REALLY need to connect more. It would be a much needed support and help us to be seen.   


Society teaches to judge everyone who isn‚Äôt at the height of productivity. I know parents of disabled children who have been asked ‚Äûwhy did you have him/her, there are options‚Äú. It‚Äôs the system for you.

We don‚Äôt need to be part of it anymore and I suppose that‚Äôs where freedom and wisdom will come from eventually. But we need that Discord, that menopause cafe, those circles of friends at a certain age.

I wish I had known when I still had the strength to set somethin up."
10j6uez,"What a brilliant heartbreak you paint. I feel you as most of us do here. I'm on anti anxiety meds but it's not the shitty place I want to be in. All we're thinking is ""Where's me? Where have I gone to?"" Just have to suffer and wait it out."
10j6uez,I feel seen here... üò≠‚ù§
10j6uez,I know how you feel and thank goodness for this forum cause you realize you are not alone.The insomnia.anxiety and forgetfulness is terrible and it can mentally and physically drain you.
10j6uez,"I absolutely love your story. I am heartbroken that you are heartbroken. Your words really touched me. We are here, right here, we are in front of you. We are your mirror. I have a very different experience with life than you. I have no children. I am broke and possibly headed for homelessness before I turn 50. My experience of menopause was terrible for the last ten years. Anxiety through the fucking roof 24/7, insomnia, sweats, sudden urgency syndrome (incontinence), depression, body identity crisis, itching, brain fog, inability to complete sentences, hyper sensitive to stress, anger, rage, etc. However it is getting better, most of those symptoms have dramatically decreased and improved. It does get better, and I am certainly not the same as before, however maybe it is for the better. Big love to you sister, you have my sword. X"
10j6uez,"It is a scary time in our lives, but not unprecedented. All just blocked out when we first started getting used to hormones back in our early teens. What a nightmare I was. There are a lot of women who face an unbelievable amount of mourning for their past selves, for their child rearing years, and we all have to look at this in a different way.

My therapist and I talked about this and she said something super helpful to me, though it may not affect you the same way. She said to look at this time of life like a new chrysalis. It's a tremendous change, but we will come out the other side. I don't know what that looks like, but I know it gives me hope.

Just know that you are not alone, this tribe of weird, wacky women is here to support you in anything you need."
10j6uez,"Oh boy did this hit home, especially the part about your son. My son got married last year and I am so sad, all this year because I don‚Äôt even think I remember his beautiful wedding, was I even awake during it or just smiling and waiting for it to be over. I just now ordered some of their wedding photos off the  photographers website A YEAR after the wedding, I am embarrassed and ashamed at so so much in my life these last 3 - 4 years but this one haunts me the most, this one makes me cry in the middle of the night when I wake up at 3 and toss and turn until 6-ish. I don‚Äôt like myself or my life anymore thanks to this fog I have to think thru and see thru like mud.  Mud splashed onto the windshield that never clears off.  Thank you for listening tonight ladies. Back to my covers."
10j6uez,"I hear you. Unfortunately,  I have so little energy, that I had to give up caring. I grieved my former self, it was tough to let go. If I had an ounce of my former strength, I would still hang on. But I don't. 

Wish I could offer more positive advice.  Others are doing better, and I encourage you to read their stories."
10j6uez,"What a beautiful post, OP. I‚Äôm an acupuncturist looking to become a menopause fairy. If you lived in my town, would you come to my clinic for community acupuncture with social time after? Or a class that has connection as a part of it? I want to create a space for at least some of us to put down our screens and have real talk, just like your post, about this time in our lives. Anyone please feel free to comment. I want to help, but I‚Äôm scared to start and I want to make something that will attract people who need or or want it or would use it. I‚Äôm in the planning stages. Tell me anything. At my group, surprise crying is totally ok. And we have baskets of fuzzy blankets!"
10j6uez,"It is mind boggling that this happens to all women yet we‚Äôre all railroaded by what is actually happening. 

I‚Äôm in North America but born to Caribbean parents. While the culture has the same patriarchy as North America the one thing that is different is the counsel of aunties. This is basically all women of the older generation are seen as your elders - whether related or not. And they form strong bonds and are seen as holding the wisdom and real power. Because female bonds are so strong, I grew up with this appreciation of the seasons of womanhood. My mother actually celebrated when I got my period (I was mortified), they openly shared pregnancy losses and they also didn‚Äôt hide the peri transition. I remember my friend‚Äôs mom celebrating menopause when she no longer had to carry emergency pads (aka diapers). Now, as I go through it I know it‚Äôs my time to become an auntie to my daughter and her generation and I have strong bonds with the women in my life (cousins, friends, etc). It doesn‚Äôt mean that it doesn‚Äôt suck - the memory fog, breast cysts, 24/7 irritability, etc. but we all laugh, cry, share. I now see my aunts in their 80s living full lives on their terms. I think part of what makes this so hard is not having that support system and women‚Äôs bodies always being shamed with no place to turn. 

So, all that to say, thank goodness for this ‚Äòcounsel of aunties‚Äô. Women supporting each other through the ups and downs with the joy, pain and wisdom that it all brings. And hopefully we can pass on this wisdom to our daughters and granddaughters."
10j6uez,"Omg yes! I look in the mirror and wonder if everyone sees what I see, An old useless vessel waiting to be put out to pasture. I am sad and angry all the time and don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I tell people all the time but they seem to think I am joking or they just don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know. I am here and with you as much as I can be. I am sorry"
10j6uez,">the gifts of menopause

Worst gift I've ever received. They can have it back, I don't want it. Not sure how being a raging, hormonal teenager with acne and a inferiority complex is a gift. I was FINALLY starting to like myself. I just keep reminding myself that ""this too shall pass"". üòå"
10j6uez,"I had a friend of over 10 years dump me a few months ago. She said that I had changed since COVID and that I was darker. She said I just needed to ‚Äúgo out and do things‚Äù and ‚Äúbe happier.‚Äù  I was stunned. She had never communicated these things with me before and I had a hell of a time these last few years. I found both my birth parents, I was forced out of a job I had for 14 years, a few health concerns and an aging dog who I just recently put down. My god. What a bitch! üòÇü´† at the heart of it was also my attitude changed due to perimenapause. I guess she didn‚Äôt like the new me. Funny enough, all my other friends are still around and they don‚Äôt seem to mind. This ride is wild."
10j6uez,"I relate to every word, except thank goodness I don't have a child to disappoint or try to be present for.

I have no comforting words. 

And, I feel this way about the state of our planet, capitalism, and society. Just very bleak.

I keep thinking if only I had the financial means to not have to work full time or work at a certain level, things would be better, but that's probably not true either."
10j6uez,"> how viciously I would have judged her.

I work a customer-facing job, and every once in awhile I watch some young woman as she stands before me and viciously judges me the way I used to judge others. 

She thinks I'm a glutton, that I've let myself go, that my ugliness is shocking. She thinks the way I look is not only an affront, but my own fault. 

She has no idea I used to be hot as hell, that I'm neither lazy nor a glutton, but merely the victim of time and a particular genetic heritage. (We live long lives, the women in my family, but we do it like witches, with triple chins and moles and big bellies.)

I don't care. She has *no idea* I know exactly what she's thinking, because she's a kid and I've got decades on her. She doesn't even know I know what she doesn't:

One, she's the minority. Most people aren't the judgemental asshole I once was. Most people are pretty nice, really.

Two, she'll get hers, one way or another. She'll either die, or she too will, through no fault of her own, wake up one day with no waist and a square ass, and then she'll know she was wrong.

Some people see me shuffling or fumbling or showing my new weakness and look away. Others rush forward to help. It turns out that accepting help is another important thing to learn."
10j6uez,"Now i‚Äôm old and menoposal I have the feeling that for the first time in my life I‚Äôm seen. I‚Äôm taken seriously. As a person who knows what she is doing and what she is talking about.
I feel sad for the past me. Who‚Äôs value was measured in hoe sexually desireble I was. 
I know this is largely my own fault and perception.
But as Wayne Dyer said, change your perception and you change your world."
10j6uez,"Don‚Äôt give hope up. It sucks, big time, but there‚Äôs a whole community of us here! 

Try a new activity. You are not alone, but I do understand the feelings."
10j6uez,"Sending a lot love to you. Like every phase of life, this one has to be trudged through (my moms advice while going through chemo;‚Äùtrudge through the moment‚Äù).
As far as relating to other menopausal women, where I work, we are pretty open and honest about symptoms and emotions (or lack there of!) and we support each other, but for the most part, it‚Äôs kind of an individual journey.
Anyway, we get you and are here for you. 
I hope things get easier."
10j6uez,Beautifully written. Maybe start journaling? I have no good answers but feel your pain and am sending positive vibes your way.
10j6uez,"OP if you can try hormones do it. BHRT has been a game changer! I am in peri and for ten years have various symptoms, not hot flashes or anything that typical, but a myriad of bizarre manifestations that waxed and waned from tearfulness, sudden weight gain then loss, anger at everything and everyone who crossed my path, then so much empathy and love for everyone and everything I thought I would explode, panic attacks in the middle of the night, social anxiety low libido, irrational fears, exhaustion so bad before my period I had to take to my bed‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a strange landscape.  BHRT all the way. Can‚Äôt say it enough. It brought me back from that hell. 

((Hugs))

And really, this is so terrible I can‚Äôt believe so little is known about it! Makes me angry and disgusted."
10j6uez,"Hey you, I hear you.  This is a phase.  It's just a shitty chunk of your life that will pass.  Not that it'll be all roses and fairies one day, or that your boobs will firm up again and you'll be ridiculously optimistic, but your ability to cope with the reality of it all will improve. I promise.  It gets better.  And sometimes it gets worse again, but then it gets better.  You don't sound privileged, you sound like a human being experiencing human suffering. This is a harder time than we ever expected it would be.  I used to think ""I'll get through this and the light at the end of the tunnel will be stunning"".  It's not.  But I'm handling it better, most of the time (though if you check my recent posting history you may think otherwise).  There are stages of grief, and we go through them blindly, feeling around in the dark, unsure and vulnerable.  That's just part of this deal.  I'm sorry! I'm here, if you need me."
10j6uez,"I‚Äôm experiencing some symptoms of the very early stage of perimenopause. I also have BPD and my emotions have been swinging so wildly lately, I‚Äôm quick to get angry, sad, upset and often feeling hopeless. I know some of it is situational depression, but I‚Äôm seeing people say this is also part of both peri/menopause, which has me confused as to what‚Äôs what. I definitely have the brain fog, forgetfulness, lethargy. I‚Äôm also mostly dealing with it alone, too, which also makes me derail quite a bit"
10j6uez,I see you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10j6uez,"Use that privilege and go on a retreat. Sounds like you need some serious self care. You have proclaimed how independently you have managed your life thus far.  More is required, not less. What is stopping you from self care- truly.  Many women would be so thankful to have resources. You have them at least financially.  Don‚Äôt waste those resources. Plan some self-care."
10j6uez,"I don't think you sound crazy. I think you've expressed what so many of us are going through. I don't know if I'm crazy or everyone else is making me feel that way. This is a horrible place to be in life. The struggle is so real, yet so ignored."
10j6uez,"I feel everything that you said. 
I have a son as well, and that‚Äôs what hits me the most.  So much love for him, and I could cry when I think of what he now sees when he looks at me."

10j6uez,All of this. Right there with you üò≠
10j6uez,"Hello dear Heartbroken. My world turned upside in 2019 to this phase. At about the 2 year mark when I felt crazier than ever, 30kg heavier, zero energy and chronic chest pain, mood swings, horrific self talk I felt I needed to get to the bottom of my emotional pain so the journey into myself began. There I found an inner wounded child, childhood trauma (emotional neglect and being hit) fear, shame, intense sadness and grief - all these emotions suppressed because I had to be a good, perfect girl to survive. To achieve. My needs came 10th on the list. I would have been the one in the aeroplane that gave their oxygen mask to someone else in the event of an emergency. What gave me courage... digging into spirituality. Honoring those difficult emotions repressed for 45 years. Healing my inner wounded child who deserved better. Biggest game changer Ecarte Tolle ...we are not the Voice in head ...that's the ego, and it's doing everything it knows how to distract you from your pain - the real you is the one who hears all the critical self talk (comes from our conditionjng, our chilhood). I have stopped work now. Practice mindfulness.  I come first. I'm developing an inner wise mind so less self sabotage and we will get there because the younger versions of me deserve a happy ever after.  This is tough. Painful but if you can start to quieten the mind, and feel the pain ... honour your pain .. we have been given feelings for a reason. you will come out stronger than ever! Other things to look at ...thyroid health, check that ...thyroid antibodies in particular - if they are elevated thyroid needs some help.v Blood sugar levels - how are they? Food really important - whole food balanced diet. Hormones - are you on HRT? Hugs ü§ó Bex"
10j6uez,I would like to return this so called gift. I don‚Äôt dislike anyone on the planet enough to regift. üò≠
10j6uez,"Get your ferritin level checked. No health professional check‚Äôs this and if they do they will not have an answer if you tell them you are so tired and something must be wrong. They will even say it‚Äôs Menopause. This was me for 10, probably 15 years. My ferritin is at 12 it should be 100 or above. Not higher than 350. I‚Äôm getting an infusion for iron. I‚Äôm so sick of being this tired. It was a NP in my Dr‚Äôs office who I did a phone visit with that put this in my chart!! She‚Äôs now going to be my new Dr."
10j6uez,I can totally relate. Hoping for better
10j6uez,I'm so sorry. Yes men do treat older women differently than young women. I'm in peri menopause. I feel ya. Hang in there...
10j6uez,Sometimes feel same then Vigorous exercise helps me a lot mentally ü§ó
10j6uez,Are you in perimenopause or menopause? Because I sure hope that what you and I are are going through is perimenopause! I am praying once I get over to the other side there is finally a reprieve!!
10j6uez,"Your writing is beautiful. If I had your gift I‚Äôd lean in to poetry or prose. I‚Äôm struggling with all these things Menopause stuck up on me early. I was just starting to realize what was going on and it seems to be over. Now I‚Äôm counting the months since my last period and going to the Mayo Clinic for a connective tissue disorder. I‚Äôve been cranky and tired for at least a year. My productivity was down. I knew it was, I tried to get help. It took to long and I was laid off. I got three goat babies. I‚Äôm leaning into farming. Anything to keep me occupied and moving. I‚Äôm going to do as much as I can as long as I can. The six months of snow on the ground here make it harder. I don‚Äôt know what will happen long term. Maybe a new job, maybe a farming business, maybe art classes. I‚Äôve got the time I didn‚Äôt have before. I‚Äôm going to learn to slow down. Breathe."
10j6uez,"Thank you for sharing your truth; I feel the same way. Menopause has completely changed me; I wish I had known this was going to happen. I might not have married a man 7 years younger than me or have an 11 year old daughter. I have no desire to ""hang"" with the much younger mothers of her friends. I.just.don't.have.the.energy. I would have made different decisions if I knew the impact of menopause. I wish it was more of an open conversation at an earlier age!"
10j6uez,So perfectly stated. I'd join you in the cloud world.
10j6uez,I have an idea for older ladies to form a commune where we take care of each other and pool our resources.
10j6uez,You are disposable when young too. You just don‚Äôt realize it.
10j6uez,Same. I don‚Äôt have a car. Currently in purgatory on uk welfare & free healthcare. Is this it?
10j6uez,üíå
10j6uez,"I, too, used to be proud of being both capable at multiple trades and being able to outwork many young men. I guess it never occurred to me before that I am also grieving the me that could have even pulled off that kind of swagger. Yes I was fighting upstream against misogyny but at least I had the energy to swim."
10j6uez,"Not that hormone therapy is a ‚Äúfix‚Äù for aging/fatigue, etc, but curious to know if you‚Äôve considered or tried them to possibly help with what you‚Äôre going through. 

Definitely not pushing for them-I know there are very real risks that come with potential benefits, and they‚Äôre complicated and not for everyone. Strictly curious, based on how you‚Äôve described yourself and your situation, if you‚Äôve considered trying them in any form. 

(FWIW I ask this as someone who is very active, still menstruating-though the timing is starting to get a little wobbly-and has been considering my own thoughts/options going forward.)"
10j6uez,"Same, 5 years ago I was painting ceilings all day no bother. I don‚Äôt like who I have become and since when did 2lbs bags of sugar get so damn heavy?"
10j6uez,"Yes, beautifully written. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10j6uez,Love her and accept her. That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm getting through it
10j6uez,"Back around the end of 2016, I decided that I was going to do better at channeling my inner Sith. (I may have been heavily into the SWTOR MMO at the time).

Peace is a lie, there is only passion.

Through strength, I gain power.

Through power, I gain victory.

Through victory, my chains are broken.

The Force shall free me.

Not for everyone, but it helps me."
10j6uez,"And it's very normal to start going through it before your 50s.  Actually it's normal to complete it before then.  45-55 is considered normal ages for full menopause.  But so much attention is focused on average being 50-52, yea not many people are going to hit average right on the bullseye, as if that was how averages work."
10j6uez,"Exactly, it started for me at 40. If men went through this it would have a medical name ‚Ä¶ like ‚ÄúLow-E‚Äù and it would have pharmaceutical companies putting all manner of money into research and all the treatments would have advertisements on TV and there would be social and medical movements to speak openly without judgement and all the doctors would have clear protocols for diagnosis and treatment, instead of this dark-ages, ignorance mind-set shit thats going on now. There would be a bunch of research into how it changes your brain. It would be recognized as this whole multi-faceted medical disease instead of just ‚Äúperiods stop, sometimes you might feel hot‚Äù social description labeled ‚Äúmenopause‚Äù that we have now."
10j6uez,"AND nobody but those of us in the same damn life raft fuckin GET IT.  I think we might just be invisible bc what we wanna say is so fuckin unappealing to anyone else not going through it.  I‚Äôm with you, sis."
10j6uez,PLEASE DO.  PLEASE.  We‚Äôre SO HERE FOR IT.  üíú
10j6uez,I have a Google doc full of bad poetry I've written during peri. I highly recommend writing as therapy for this awful time.
10j6uez,"I‚Äôve tried every form of BHRT and I now have the hormone levels of a 20 year old and yet none of it has touched this feeling like I‚Äôm a completely different person and everything enjoyable has been taken away from me and I‚Äôm not even 50 yet. At least the experimentation keeps my hopes up which is better than nothing. So while HrT eases a lot of symptoms, it does nothing for the ‚Äúchange‚Äù."
10j6uez,"My BFF sent me this the other day re: negative self talk. Eye opening.

10j6uez,"I, too, do not like the new me. Also,  what is with the sudden surfacing of memories of being a doormat for years and the bitterness that comes with it?? It's as bad as the physical aspects."
10j6uez,"Don‚Äôt wanna oversimplify the sleep thing, but two things have helped me (a lifelong insomniac with night-owl tendencies) tremendously so I want to share where I can:

About an hour before bed, I take 600 mg of Calcium Citrate, 300 mg of Magnesium Citrate, and 20 mg of CBD (the Sunsoil brand, without THC, works best for me after a lot of experimentation). 

I also use a weighted blanket (the throw sized one from Baloo, which can be machine washed & dried & doesn‚Äôt shift around inside the case because it‚Äôs made differently). 

This stuff together, combined with avoiding doomscrolling/screens in general (books are better anyway!) has let me finally get some good sleep, which has made stuff if not *easy*, then certainly *easier.*

Wishing you good luck with it-not sleeping sucks; maybe try this!"
10j6uez,"I have read that for girls, the three or four years before puberty are the ‚Äúmagic years‚Äù,  that time when they are the most spirited, adventurous, and optimistic. Then puberty hits, and the magic is gone."
10j6uez,Who was I before puberty?  Enduring a deeply unhappy childhood.  Sure abusive dysfunctional family etc.  Though I suppose there were a few moments of joy.  There is no good childhood time to get back to.
10j6uez,"This is priceless wisdom!   It has been so many decades that we forget that girl deep inside of us and who we really are.  Yes, I am a daughter, wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, etc,   but deep inside I am ME!  We lose ourselves to other people and material things over the years. We put on a mask and play our part because we are told that is what we have to do - well, I am DONE.  I am ME for the first time in forever.  I am living not just existing.  I made some big changes in my life (left mormonism, quit a job I hated, changed my appearance and my clothing style, started up a very small business selling craft items) and I have never been more happy.  Sometimes we have to take a big bold step back and make some hard changes in our lives to be happy.  Wishing everyone here the very best of luck."
10j6uez,i liked to climb trees play with my barbies and make mud pies .....
10j6uez,I should have added that I did receive HRT throughout most of my experience. Thanks. X
10j6uez,"See, puberty for me was nothing compared to this reverse puberty time. Puberty felt very natural, yes things were changing but it was ‚Äúsame but just different‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt better or worse. It never felt wrong. The bad things ‚Äúperiods, acne‚Äù, felt very manageable. 

  This‚Ä¶ this just feels off and very wrong. And then to have my peer group be all like ‚Äúyeah, I felt hot for a little while, that‚Äôs it‚Äù, really let‚Äôs me know that the ‚Äúthis is wrong‚Äù gut-feeling is dead-on‚Ä¶. Something is not right here. Non of my 25 symptoms feels at all manageable. I feel like I‚Äôm dying actually. And women in my family live to be 95. So I have to live 45 years like this? I feel like I don‚Äôt even want to live another week feeling like this."
10j6uez,"Not OP, but I would come!"
10j6uez,"YES!!!!  I would visit you for acupuncture and connection anytime.  Cry on your couch, drink some damiana tea maybe.  Please, please create your space - I dream of doing the same thing, either setting up a virtual community where we meet over zoom weekly or creating a structure for women to set up community chapters all over the world.  It's all I think about.  There are so many of us and it's horrible but we are dying without community,  literally and figuratively, we need a secret badge to wear - a symbol - something so we can spot each other."
10j6uez,I WOULD BE THERE FOR THIS.
10j6uez,"I don‚Äôt know what magical land you live in, but I am SURE people would come (and will come!)

10j6uez,"Her loss, anyone that‚Äôs only there for you during the ‚Äúgood times‚Äù isn‚Äôt a friend at all. Sending hugs menopause sister."
10j6uez,"Yes, at least in my case its not really true. My life on paper right now is fabulous. But I can‚Äôt enjoy one minute because of this. Hell, winning the lottery would probably only make me happy for 5 minutes and then I would be back to bah humbug crabby menopause lady. If there is any
Silver lining to this is that I finally can let go of any desire to own a large beautiful house. Because I know I would be moping in that house, in pain, feeling tired, and crabby, and apathetic and completely unable to enjoy the nice surroundings. It‚Äôs the same reason I don‚Äôt take vacations. Menopause is actually saving me lots of money because I have no desire to do anything."
10j6uez,üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è i see all of you too!  üñ§
10j6uez,"This is good advice. Someone else mentioned thinking back to the girl you were before puberty hit. Maybe said retreat (whatever ‚Äúretreat‚Äù means to you, but it should definitely include plenty of solo time) can revolve around something you liked then (and possibly gave up) and want to revisit now."
10j6uez,"I‚Äôm with you, but when i pretend your advice is directed at me, my knee-jerk response is ‚Äúbut self-care IS a waste of resources that i need to save FOR EVERYONE ELSE.‚Äù  And yes, I KNOW THAT‚ÄôS SOME SERIOUS BULLSHIT, and I‚Äôm working hard on feeling valued, but i need to first overcome my dumbass mindset before i can take self-care (& self-compassion) seriously.  Sux but there it is.  ü´§"
10j6uez,There was the show - New Zealand I think -The Lake?? Anyway this group of woman live in their own shipping containers. Men aren‚Äôt allowed. I was think hmm they‚Äôre on to something üòÇüòâ
10j6uez,"At least they want to keep you around for your eggs. You're basically a valuable natural resources until you aren't. It's like being a racehorse. Once you've broken a leg or are too old to run, you're off to the glue factory."
10j6uez,"on the plus side, it might be better than being American?  Oh and we don't really have welfare here."
10j6uez,"Men age out of physical jobs too. True, true, they don't have menopause, which makes even a stupid office job almost impossible when one is still fairly youngish (40s).  But we keep going because there is no alternative."
10j6uez,Absolutely feel this. I still work a physical job but dang it is so much harder now
10j6uez,"I just started estrogen/progesterone at low levels and have some relief from other symptoms. I do consider increasing the dose to try that as a possibility, also have been trying to take better care of myself. I would have to go to a clinic, my HMO is behind in the game. I know some women get energy back. It seems very individual how it affects us. Thanks for asking."
10j6uez,"Hit upon it, you have."
10j6uez,"I eventually figured out what was going on with me after years of struggling and brought it up with my doctor. She said I was too young. I was 45. If even doctors don‚Äôt know the correct info, what hope is there for the rest of us?"
10j6uez,"That scares me. :(

I'm still going to try. The one thing thought that leaves me hopeful is my recent experience with estrogen did have me feeling like my old self. But it was short lived by design, so I don't know what would happen with more. Is it fine tuning? Or is it just early enough that a little bit of a replacement is enough to make a world of a difference? 

Do you mind outlining what you've tried and what has worked better or worse? I've got an appointment at my dr on friday, so real world experience might help me."
10j6uez,"The only thing that helps me is the ""U curve of happiness."" We're at the bottom, my dears.

10j6uez,I love this.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
10j6uez,"We betrayed ourselves to serve the patriarchy. Sorry, I know that sounds hardcore, but there it is. So now we decide to not do it anymore! We don't deserve it and we need to be our own best ally now."
10j6uez,"I'm really sorry. I have CPTSD from a bad childhood that I'm using this time to address. I was lucky in that I did have a loving grandmother and was able to make friends in some of the neighborhoods we moved to. And nature has always come through for me. I enjoyed it as a child and that's why it's such a beautiful connection for me now.

I still believe for nearly all of us there is an essential self we can connect to and love. It takes extra time and effort for those of us who didn't have that love modeled for us, but I still think we can. My best hopes go out to you."
10j6uez,"Yes. I don't look back to that time fondly. Criticism about weight. Watching my parents hate each other--my mother too afraid to leave because my father made so much more money. I was afraid of everything. I actually found my very early 40s to be the best time in my life. And I knew it. I knew it was going to fade. Heading into 47, and I don't even feel like that woman anymore."
10j6uez,I can relate 100% to this.
10j6uez,"Congrats! I'm still living in the belly of the Mormon beast (SLC, lol). It's a strange patriarchal place in which to shave your hair and let it grow back silver, shut out family members who aren't healthy for you, and live happily as a single woman . But I've found the more I let go of the fear and move toward who I want to be, the more true friends who support me are coming to the fore. I understand OPs despair. I've been there and it's definitely part of the process. It's been a few years now, my silver hair is long and I've had a few sad goodbyes. But there is still plenty to say hello to as well. Increased authenticity and true connection are my new goals. I'm my new best ally."
10j6uez,"Understood, HRT doesn't always cure everything.  Sorry about the financial stuff.  I'd have a few steps between losing my job and homelessness (including a boyfriend who has a job he hates and can't find another job at all, so has to stay at it, so really not good options)."
10j6uez,"I've had the same experiences, other women kind of shrugging and being like I had no problems. But I've also heard from a lot of women that have said that the mood changes and insomnia were not only unexpected but also life-changingly horrible. I don't know what I would have done if I didn't go to the hospital and have a nurse practitioner who actually listened to me and suggested a plan when I was having anxiety so bad that my whole body was trembling. Prozac has been a lifesaver for me, Zoloft just stopped working."
10j6uez,Great! I need to know if people would come. I want to turn my whole practice into supporting us all through this.
10j6uez,"The symbol should be Medusa. Or Kali, goddess of birth and destroyer of worlds.  

And I would join this! DO IT!"
10j6uez,"Thanks, OP! And everyone else who chimed in. I‚Äôm going to give it a try, and hopefully have something on my books in the next month."
10j6uez,Aww thanks. I‚Äôm still in shock a bit TBH. Luckily I have a lot of other great women in my life.
10j6uez,"So, since you seem receptive. Let me give you a bit of harsh truth that I had to learn and it sucked to hear.  That attitude makes you a massively egocentric martyr.  You are afraid. Afraid that nobody will like you if you don‚Äôt pour every ounce of yourself into them. Afraid the world will fall apart if you don‚Äôt do it all and do it perfect.  You are your own problem and have trained everyone else around you to rely on you instead of adulting like they need to as if you don‚Äôt exist.  People die every day and those who are left behind, move on. Do they appreciate what you have done for them?  Probably because they miss having someone to do all their shit for them. But they will still move on and be just fine.  You are literally giving away the one life you have so you can tell yourself that you are good. Stop it.  You can take care of yourself and still give enough to others while expecting them to be adults and take care of themselves. Boundaries. Strong, loving, boundaries.  There is a balance to be had where you can take joy in choosing what you love to do for others and still take care of yourself. Start today by choosing one thing you are no longer doing for others.  You won‚Äôt die or disappear."
10j6uez,Top of the Lake. I‚Äôd join Holly Hunter‚Äôs cult lol.
10j6uez,Sometimes I had rather live in a shipping container commune of like minded folks than put up with men.
10j6uez,Who? Men?
10j6uez,"Social Welfare is welfare, I even go to a social welfare office."
10j6uez,Keep hanging in there with the HRT. When you get your dosage right it‚Äôs life changing.
10j6uez,It's stunning how ignorant physicians are about menopause.
10j6uez,"Well the crazy thing is that there‚Äôs a ton of different hormone products and different ones work different in everyone. For me, I started with the low dose ones (E-patch, OTC progesterone cream, low dose rx progesterone cream) because that‚Äôs all you can get with a regular doctor. And it would work for like a week and then stop working. I needed higher and higher doses. And the E patch made me blow up like a tick. I‚Äôve also tried injections. Now I‚Äôm on rhythmic dosing E and P cream, which is high dose. I‚Äôve been on that for 3 years and it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve tried. Right now I‚Äôm working on getting my thyroid optimized because with all this I‚Äôve gained huge amounts of weight. You can certainly start with the E patch, and whatever form of progesterone they give you, that alone works for some people, and if it works, fabulous, because insurance pays and it‚Äôs pretty easy."
10j6uez,Why though? What is happening inside the brain to make us like this? And we just have to sit around and wait until it‚Äôs over when we are in our 80‚Äôs and too feeble to do anything? I want to live before I‚Äôm too old to do so! Why did evolution make us like this? None of it makes any sense.
10j6uez,"Yes for brief period of time in my very early 40s it was very good (although my 30s were pretty good too).  I might say I was middle age, and my boyfriend said we were young plus (young+), young and yet with some wisdom and knowledge about life, young ONLY BETTER.  It seemed kinda true for a brief moment.

By 43 I had some definite life disturbing peri symptoms, by late 44 they were really horrendous.  I also had some financial struggles for awhile.  But very early 40s were good.  But that was after moving past some of the childhood stuff.  So going back to childhood doesn't even sound nice.  I'm 47."
10j6uez,"I love this, you have inspired me. I have a very fractured relationship with my narcissistic, perpetual liar of a ""mother"". I just hung up the phone on her for the first time in my life this afternoon. And so far 2 more times already. I actually said to myself, I don't know why I even try with this woman anymore, all she does is make me feel bad and sad. I really needed to read what you shared because I was already formulating a text in my mind that was to apologise and specifically thought that I would just say ""sorry, the menopause is really annoying"". But you just made it so clear why I am feeling like this right now. Thanks love. X"
10j6uez,I would absolutely come!
10j6uez,"Probably you should say (as specifically or vaguely as you‚Äôre comfortable with) what part of the world you live in, so people who are near you in the world can maybe look forward to this üòÑü´∂üèº"
10j6uez,I think you should create a post polling the sub on this so you can see that we‚Äôd ALLLLLL be up in this.
10j6uez,I'm actually going to see a naturopath/acupuncturist for the second time tomorrow.  2 weeks ago she said that I was a classic case of liver qi stagnation with a little spleen thrown in.  She also ordered a ton of bloodwork.  Looking forward to learning more!
10j6uez,Have you looked into becoming certified in pellet therapy ?
10j6uez,[removed]
10j6uez,"That‚Äôs awesome. Sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to be able to bitch to someone and have them just listen, understand and not judge."
10j6uez,Yes!! That‚Äôs it. The women were odd but I guess I‚Äôm getting pretty odd myself ü§™
10j6uez,"Ok yes i meant in America, we don't have much of a safety net in the U.S., the U.S. is wealthier overall still probably, but very harsh.  But I'm not sure how exactly it compares in everything to the UK."
10j6uez,"Have you tried testosterone? Another redditor said that‚Äôs what she finally needed to kick some of this. 

I am bloated on estrogen too, and it‚Äôs just the local! I‚Äôd rather be bloated and fat than miserable and tired but who knows if that is even the devils bargain?"
10j6uez,"Oooh I know this one! There is so much great literature out there right now on this topic. Try ""Will I Ever Be Good Enough"" by Dr. Karyl McBride. And Dr. Ramani on youtube really helped me get out from under the spell my mother spun. 

It's our time now. Our anger is not to be quelled. It is to be listened to and understood and changes implemented. With love for everyone, including ourselves. Most importantly ourselves. 

I reached 56 after a lifetime of accomodating everyone else. I'd hit a rough spot in my life. And I looked around and asked where was everyone I'd spent my whole life putting ahead of me? Nowhere. I am my only constant. I'm not going to compromise myself anymore. I'll be myself and if people want to stick around, great. Otherwise, I'd rather be alone."
10j6uez,"My daughter in law had this same problem with her mother.  She has had to put down some real firm boundaries.  At first there was a lot of push back and anger from her mom.  Even when my daughter in law wanted to give in she didn't.  She held her ground.  It honestly took a couple of years, but now her Mom is civil and stays in her place because she knows my daughter in law will go no contact with her.  I hope this gives you hope for future change."
10j6uez,I‚Äôm on the Olympic Peninsula in WA.
10j6uez,I‚Äôm not sure what kind of pellet therapy you are talking about. I won‚Äôt be able to Rx HRT pellets as an acupuncturist
10j6uez,"That is outside of my scope, unfortunately."
10j6uez,Yep - we‚Äôre all in this together.
10j6uez,"Gotcha, yes I‚Äôm really really grateful for the benefit system here. I‚Äôd be in a tent over there. Actually I‚Äôd have finessed a prison term by now. Roof, meals and fight club when I need it kinda sounds sweet some days. 
Welfare here covers the bare basics. Cable car internet package and fast food? nope, not as a single/no dependents in private rental. Better than a tent, and free healthcare ‚Ä¶ as I wait on a looong list for meno specialist."
10j6uez,"Yes, I‚Äôve tried it in cream form. I didn‚Äôt notice that it fixed any of those problems and I didn‚Äôt like the hair growth in funny places. Maybe it was helping and it was so subtle that I didn‚Äôt notice? I dunno. So I stopped it for a long time but I‚Äôm now back on T cream because my T labs are extremely low. I would at least like to get them up into the normal range. The last labs that I had showed the T to be even lower than when I started. I give up."
10j6uez,It is bizarre how supplemental estrogen causes such metabolic dysfunction in some. I can‚Äôt figure it out! If I‚Äôm gaining weight because my estrogen has tanked than why am I gaining weight when I‚Äôm restoring my levels to optimal???
10j6uez,Oh wow. Light bulb moment. When peri started in my early 40s I started going to therapy and I spent so many hours crying to my therapist about how I've never been or will never be good enough in my mother's eyes. I felt like such a jackass for being a grown woman but still being so damaged by my mother's disappointment in and detachment from me. Parents can really fuck you up! I think the hormone changes in peri brought my poor inner child back to the surface and it took me a long time to heal her.
10j6uez,"My God, you got this right.  So much time spent doing and being for others.  Now is my time to love myself and do right by myself.  I have a passion to make sure my granddaughters understand that they don't have to give up, put up or shut up for other people.  I want them to live their own best lives."
10j6uez,"Thank you for sharing, I think it will likely take something as extreme as shutting my mother off for her to even contemplate accepting her role in my life and the abuse she allowed."
10j6uez,ü•∞
10j6uez,We don‚Äôt even have a menopause specialist! I hope worth the wait.
10j6uez,"My guess is that its not really optimal and there is a delicate balance that our bodies are best at regulating because of built in feedback loops. We can't duplicate that, and as far as I can tell, we're only replacing some of the hormones, like estradiol is the ""important"" one so we replace that. I don't know enough yet to say for sure that is the case but I suspect it is.

Also I was in a rabbit hole skimming  research around estrogen late one night and there was something about two different estradiol receptors E2a and E2b, and there was something about either only e2b responds to exogenous estradiol or that e2a is downregulated in menopause regardless of the presences of estradiol.

I have too many tabs open and was skimming too late at night so I can't recall what the specifics were, but I mention because I'm sure all these little things mean hormone replacement, at least as it is now, can only do so much."
10j6uez,And going no contact is sometimes the best we can do.
10j6uez,"There is a website that lists all of them for USA, check the wiki. 
Better be, I‚Äôm at 8 months and likely another 8. It‚Äôs the only way I can get testosterone and bio hrt."
10j6uez,"That‚Äôs so interesting. If that is the case, then I wonder if the different receptors respond better to different types of estrogen (estriol, estradiol, estrone) and that is why they change at menopause. Why else would we have different receptors? Like if we have less estradiol and more estrone, maybe the receptors change to have more estrone receptors. I‚Äôm just throwing stuff out there. Seems to me that receptors would change in response to environment, not the other way around. 
   How do we hack this? I know that my estrone is not outrageously high. It‚Äôs certainly higher than your average 20 year old. I wonder if that is the issue. 
   Certainly a lot to think about. Why don‚Äôt we have the best scientific minds working on this stuff? What is the difference between a woman who sails through menopause with no exogenous estrogen, and has minimal to no symptoms and a woman who becomes disabled by debilitating symptoms? Like, what is going on inside? How many receptors do they have? What are their estrogen levels? Are the asymptomatic woman‚Äôs adrenals simply so strong that they still have a high level of estradiol and that‚Äôs it? So many questions."
10j6uez,"Indeed, so many questions and the more I read, the more questions I have.  I'm trying to get a handle on my understanding right now. Like am I going to understand and solve menopause because I'm googling white papers in the middle of the night? No, but I want to get some idea of what is going on in me  to inform choices to the best of my ability. (Also I've been super into the brain since what was essentially an intro neuroscience course (physiological psychology) and so this ties neatly into the interest.)

The biggest issue is that there is so much information to read and understand and I am not a neuroscientist. And I know I've got some motivated reasoning going on. I'm also trying to figure out how much we know about hormones and menopause, and how much is just purely about hormone receptors during a woman's fertile years.

&#x200B;

>If that is the case, then I wonder if the different receptors respond better to different types of estrogen (estriol, estradiol, estrone) and that is why they change at menopause.

I don't think so but I honestly don't know. We didn't cover the specifics of how hormones interact with receptors, only that they do.  If it works like neurotransmitters, then you'd have one kind of receptor for each hormone, but multiple subtypes of that receptor that are found in different places and do slightly different things. But I don't know with hormones! I'm gonna go back into my text book and see if its in there, we didn't cover everything in the textbook.

>Why else would we have different receptors? Like if we have less estradiol and more estrone, maybe the receptors change to have more estrone receptors.

Receptors do upregulate and downregulate for a number of reasons. They can downregulate with disuse, but also upregulate when too little of a neurotrasmitter is needed. And they can downregulate in the presence of too much of a neurotransmitter. Like above, I don't know how that varies with hormones.

Gosh, I would love like a month to go hide in the library and just read as much as I could on this. :)

&#x200B;

>Why don‚Äôt we have the best scientific minds working on this stuff?

I feel like its a women in STEM issue, and if that is the case, I think that is going to change within the next generation. Solved it? I don't think so. But have more knowledge and better treatments, I hope so, even if its not in time to benefit us much. But a big hurdle is going to be deciding if we should even treat menopause beyond treating uncomfortable symptoms. Seems like the medical community thinks no, this is totally okay. Hell, I don't even know how I feel about it even though I hate it. My gut is that I should be trying to restore hormones to what would be physiologically normal for someone in their fertile years. Not for fertility, but for wellness. But I don't know the consequences or how much that's been done or researched.

That being said, there is at least a few researchers that's looking at manipulating or stopping menopause: [https://neo.life/2022/06/is-it-time-to-cancel-menopause/](https://neo.life/2022/06/is-it-time-to-cancel-menopause/)"
10j6uez,"Interesting article. Hopefully they gain insight into bad menopause symptoms through this research into extending fertility. But I would like a more targeted approach, let‚Äôs study the women who don‚Äôt have the symptoms and compare with the women who do, beyond the whole ‚Äúeat more soy because Japanese women eat that and they don‚Äôt have symptoms‚Äù. I think that would provide a ton of clues.  

I‚Äôm interested in the brain too. I used to work on a psych inpatient unit as an RN and in addition to the horrible ways my own brain has changed with peri, I have so many patients that make me wonder. There is always 5 random menopausal women on the unit there just to get electroconvulsive therapy, because one day they just took to their beds (or the couch) and just became a dysfunctional zombie. Nowhere in their medical treatment are the doctors even addressing their hormone status or giving them hormone treatment to see if it helps as opposed to sending electricity through their brain for 15 or 30 sessions. Side effects of the ECT are mostly not too bad, but I had this one sweet little elderly woman that absolutely lost her mind with EcT right in front of us. She was like 6 ECT sessions in and she went from alert and oriented times 4 and normal, no dementia, just depressed, to full-on dementia with nonstop screaming 24/7, and I mean, she would scream the entire shift without stopping, she hardly even took a breath. The staff would just stare at each other in disbelief. I would go home and come back the next day or next week and I could hear her screaming before even entering the unit, I have never seen anything like it, ever. She was getting enough meds to knock out a horse, nothing touched her. Every shift security had to come up to hold her still so we could inject her with meds that would take down a man in his prime and it wouldn‚Äôt even slow her down. She had to be in restraints for safety, She didn‚Äôt sleep anymore, she didn‚Äôt know her name, day, time, location, she would scream the same nonsensical sentence for 8 hours straight, her poor son couldn‚Äôt believe what happened to her. I couldn‚Äôt believe she didn‚Äôt even lose her voice. She was driving the other patients mad with all the noise. And you could tell just by observing her and listening to her shouting that she had been thrown into some sort of frightening and confusing hellscape. Her thoughts would just loop around and around for hours and there was a current of anxiety with it, It was almost like witnessing a bad LSD trip, like the worst LSD trip that anyone ever had. I felt like she KNEW that she had lost her mind overnight. 
    
    Anyway, we both agree that more research has to be done. The book ‚ÄúSex, Lies, and Menopause‚Äù by T.S. Wiley is super interesting! You might like it. She developed the BHRT rhythmic dosing method, and kudos to her for diving in and developing something beyond the therapies of the day that didn‚Äôt work for everyone. That method restores your hormones to that of a 20-year old. I‚Äôm on it, it‚Äôs kinda a pain in the ass, and does not make me feel like a 20 year old, but it works the best for me out of everything else I‚Äôve tried. It has fixed a lot of broken things for me. I‚Äôm still working on the few things that it hasn‚Äôt fixed yet."
10jfhyi,"Navigating this no sex drive/low libido thing now.  First thing we did was talk about it and expressed what we were both feeling.  After that I did my research into supplements for low libido and estrogen.   I now take Olly‚Äôs Lovin Libido along with my estrogen supplement.  It works for my needs and is in a good price range for me.  He looked into lubes, even going in person to talk to someone at an adult store to see what they recommended.  He came home with lube and a vibrator (the clerk was past menopause and suggested this from her own experience).  We tried it and hate to say it but it helps even though I don‚Äôt use the vibrator (not for me).  He suggested we go together to the shop so I can pick out the lube this time, he picked one with a smell I can‚Äôt handle.   But the point of me telling you this is because we are working together to figure out how to bring back that portion of our relationship even if it means it will be different then before.  And it allows him to understand that it‚Äôs not his fault or my fault.  It‚Äôs just something we have to deal with and figure out together."
10jfhyi,"I just had dinner last weekend with my two best friends - both 42, both still very sexual. They spent the whole evening talking about sex - one is newly divorced and enjoying single life, the other still active with her husband.

I sat there listening from what felt like a very far distance. It was just a few years ago that I was also wanting to be intimate with my husband or felt sexual and sexy in my day to day life. I‚Äôm still young? Why did it all disappear?

I don‚Äôt have any answers, but thanks ladies for not making me feel so all alone. I know my girlfriends may experience this too someday and as usual, I will be the wise old woman who‚Äôs gone through something challenging before anybody else has and I have to figure it all out on my own first.  Xx"
10jfhyi,"My parts so far still work, but I no longer have urges.  I have had to shift to a more mindful, deliberate approach.  It really helped me to read about the difference between spontaneous desire and responsive desire.  I still can respond once things start, so I am super grateful.  There is a great book called ‚ÄúCome as you are‚Äù that helped me understand how to handle this shift and feel not broken about it."
10jfhyi,"This is a problem for us also. Married 23 years. Since menopause,  my libido is zero. It was also killed off by antidepressants.  Since weaning off most of those and arriving at post-menopause,  I am willing, but my tissues are dry and bleed even being touched.

Four prior gynos did nothing for me. Couldn't get HRT, the best recommendations were to get lube which didn't work and left me discouraged. My current GYN prescribed very expensive Premarin,  and that just irritates me. 

Combine that with the fact that he can't stay hard enough for penetration, and turned down a Rx for help since I can't stand being touched there.

We talked about getting ""toys"" but haven't pursued it because I am so exhausted all the time I barely have energy to function.

I think it's wonderful that Ladycatzendadragon (?) the other poster here is working with her husband to find solutions. My husband would be willing also, but I don't know where to start."
10jfhyi,"If your clitoris is still not feeling anything and you cannot masturbate, then you should go back to your gyn and insist on further treatment - I can't say what that is, but that sounds liek you are still experiencing urogenital symptoms of menopause and that while you've managed to deal with vaginal atrophy, the vagifem isn't helping the rest of you. 

I know I was in the early stages of losing feeling and struggling to masturbate because of loss of feeling in my clitoris and estrace cream was not enough, (it also wasnt' enough re-vaginal atrophy, though it helped some). I got the estring insert and my clitoris is waking up. Not back to normal, but geez there is feeling there again when I'm aroused.

One thing I've seen mentioned here and elsewhere is that we have gyns and medicine in general more focused on how to fix vaginal atrophy because of a bias in medicine where women's sexual health is geared towards what men want and need with sex, not us. So vaginas have been prioritized. I don't know exactly what to do with this information other than to say vaginal atrophy is only one component of urogential symptoms and you should insist that your doc do more, and if unwilling, find a doc that will (and from what I gather, this is difficult)."
10jfhyi,"After a LOT of talking about it and coming to understand how my lack of libido was hurting him emotionally, I found a couple of cocktails and a vitamin E vaginal suppository helps. We came to an agreement that once a week is enough for him and he appreciates my making an effort. I had to make him understand that it wasn't him. I'm no longer have sexual attraction to anyone.  I have no desire whatsoever.  Can't go on hormones for health reasons, but I love him enough to be intimate with him. I see it as an expression of my love for him now, where in the past it had more to do with both of us having a good time. We put on a movie, have a couple of drinks, and it makes it like a date. We also make it a point to sit down during the week and talk or watch a show, with no expectations other than to hang out. The key is to both be honest with each other."
10jfhyi,"I mean, also...marijuana. My libido is definitely lower. But pot helps."
10jfhyi,"Might want to look into [sensate focus](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjvpf6Pud78AhUnPEQIHZLNCusQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smsna.org%2Fpatients%2Fdid-you-know%2Fwhat-is-sensate-focus-and-how-does-it-work&usg=AOvVaw3UKTroPn8jiYjHvK8Oozef). The focus in on reconnecting and not sexual touch. It's been helping to me to learn how differently my body responds to touch now. The old tried-and-true arousal touches just don't work for me any more. But I've found that other areas are more sensitive in nice ways. Plus he's happy because it means we're touching (even non-sexual) and that I'm working on it.

Lube: I've have great luck with [Pjur Aqua](https://www.pjur.us/us/pjur-aqua#187=106). Non-greasy, no oil, no scent. Slick but not slimy. Very helpful.

The North American Menopause Society has [a page on partnered sex](https://www.menopause.org/for-women/sexual-health-menopause-online/effective-treatments-for-sexual-problems/steps-your-partner-can-take). The biggest piece: work on this together! This isn't a you problem. This is a life changing event for both of you. So tackle it together with as much kindness, support, and respect as possible.

Sex does not mean penis-in-vagina penetration. There's a million other ways to be sexually alive together than painful penetration!"
10jfhyi,"I've been with my partner for over 20 years. 10 years ago he experienced an unexpected health crisis and a life altering diagnosis. This was despite his healthy weight, healthy diet and consistent exercise. It was completely outside his control and in no way his fault. This had a huge impact on our physical intimacy. I didn't abandon him. I didn't cheat. We communicated and creatively figured out how to adapt together as a couple. 

As stressful as that experience was, I feel it provided a useful example of how to navigate the changes that I'm experiencing. My body is changing. This is despite my healthy weight, healthy diet and consistent exercise. This is completely outside my control and in no way my fault. It has a huge impact on our physical intimacy. He hasn't abandoned me. He hasn't cheated. Once again, we're communicating and creatively figuring out how to adapt together as a couple.

For us, physical intimacy and connection is an important part of our relationship, but it's far from the most important part and it's okay for it to change. Penis in vagina sex can be enjoyable when it happens, but we don't prioritize it. We focus on other ways give/receive pleasure and experience shared orgasms. Two of our best purchases ever: an under-the-bed restraint system, and an at-home massage table with plush linens and quality massage oils.

10jfhyi,"I just want to say I‚Äôm very glad you are able and want to communicate with your husband, my drunk husband accused me of being with someone else. He thinks I should just ‚Äúwork‚Äù when he wants to. I hate this so much in my life. It‚Äôs just horrible."
10jfhyi,Is there a reason you aren't on oestrogen hrt? Your body will be converting the testostorone into oestrogen. Oestrogen levels must be addressed first
10jfhyi,[deleted]
10jfhyi,Marijuana specifically Indica strain works wonders for me! My husband drives a state over every few months and never complains one bit.
10jfhyi,"I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnavigated‚Äù like it‚Äôs past tense but we have some kind of treacherous waters behind us and lately it‚Äôs been a little smoother sailing. Honestly, it‚Äôs taken so much communication it‚Äôs exhausting. Together for almost 20 years, married with kids. 

What we have tried: toys, non-penetrative sex, topical estrogen, Wellbutrin for me, Viagra for him. 

***‚Äîextremely NSFW stuff below‚Äî***

Toys: that has helped. Use it or lose it seems to be true. Start small and go slow. Use a good lube. Maybe don‚Äôt even start by introducing it anywhere around him, just try a small vibe on yourself. Also highly recommend estrogen cream in tandem with this.

‚ÄúDates‚Äù that aren‚Äôt sex: this is controversial and I hesitate to suggest it to any women without knowing her  personally and knowing more about her specific feelings around consent. But this is what I meant by the communication being exhausting‚Ä¶ the negotiations for what kind of touching is on the menu. 

I now understand that my husband is a human being who has a need for intimate touch. I prefer that he not seek that elsewhere, because of potential emotional complications that could impact our marriage. Therefore, I am willing to accommodate his needs.. and occasionally find myself becoming aroused as well. 

Usually this means, I give him oral. He enjoys receiving it and he knows that, even if I don‚Äôt want him touching my body, I have a genuine and loving interest in making him happy and that is the feeling I am acting from. I do prefer him being in a chair or me on my knees, both because it turns him on (and ends it sooner lmao) and he can‚Äôt reach me and touch my boobs or vagina and risk me having to ask him to stop. Sometimes it feels good enough to me to ask him to come to the bed and then we go further. Sometimes I really don‚Äôt want to give him oral so I might put on some stockings or something for him and let him masturbate on me. Sometimes we introduce porn to either make things go faster or just spice it up. 

Depending on your feelings about this, you might think about giving him a budget to spend on an OnlyFans thing every month. You could even pick a couple to watch together once and see if they get you aroused at all. Think about toys for him. Honestly, this sounds mad, but I know this couple who are in a sexless marriage for various reasons, and he has this VR headset and this vibe that interacts with the headset and the wife (a good friend of mine) said he doesn‚Äôt even feel a need to find sex outside their marriage anymore. Seriously. Be creative. 

By Viagra for him, I really mean this: sometimes it can be hard for men at this age to get the erection they want with the responsiveness they want. Also, let‚Äôs be practical, maybe he‚Äôs been masturbating a lot. If he is going to need extra stimulation to finish, I don‚Äôt want it to be at the expense of my anatomy, you get my drift? 

Also, I feel like in the category of Even More Difficult Topics is when/how to end sex if it‚Äôs not going to end in orgasm. The ideal of the ‚Äúend goal‚Äù has to be willingly and cheerfully abandoned without anyone‚Äôs feelings getting hurt. Easier said than done. I understand if you feel some trepidation about the idea but at least in my marriage, it made things easier not harder (or should I say harder and therefore easier? Lmao) 

I hope this helps you. ü´∂"
10jfhyi,"My doc says the testosterone cream is unreliable. I started getting a bio-identical testosterone (and now estrogen) pellet a couple of years ago. It takes a few weeks for the hormones to build up in your system, but my sex drive is higher than it‚Äôs ever been in my life. And it also helped the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just losing my life force‚Äù feeling that I got after menopause. I have more creative and emotional energy. 

It‚Äôs by far the best medical decision I‚Äôve ever made."
10jfhyi,"I just want to say *no kids, a number of cats*
Same sister, same.

Also,  I know you said you aren't having any feeling in your clit, and I'll assume you have tried a vibe but if not definitely definitely try it. I'm often not horny at all but I'll force myself to use it (alone) and it's never let me down. Also porn. Just make sure to open up the private browser lol."
10jfhyi,"I cannot recommend enough the last episode of this podcast

[https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/come-as-you-are](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/come-as-you-are)

In fact, the whole series if you have time - but she poses questions that made me think about desire in a whole new way."
10jfhyi,This is me.  I hate it
10jfhyi,"Sometimes you just don‚Äôt feel like being touched, and that‚Äôs ok. The idea that you have to be having the maximum amount of sex at all times is ridiculous and too much pressure. My desire is killed anytime I feel like I have to do it bc he NeEdS it. Idk wht the answer is. Jut venting."
10jfhyi,"I mean....

I have to say, I don't have all the sympathy in the world for these guys for whom having someone else to get off with is some kind of world crisis. I'm an extremely sexual person. I'm also a single mom who decided men were way more trouble than they were worth some time ago. And I have hands and toys, and, truth be told, I am far better at getting myself off than every man I've ever known except one has been, and I've been with a lot of guys. 

Hon, you have your own loss of libido to deal with. You don't owe him a libido, and you don't owe him sex to make a marriage with. If you don't feel it, you don't feel it. This is where he can learn how to take care of himself -- several times a day, if necessary -- and learn how to cuddle and be intimate with you in ways that aren't reliant on your feeling sexy.

Basically, his excess libido in this picture is his problem. Learning to be intimate in ways that don't have sex as the destination, that's for both of you."
10jfhyi,"I will chime in to say weed helps as does sexual stimulation. I know it seems counter intuitive, but having sex with a partner or alone helps with comfort and arousal.  It is a bit of use it or lose it.  I will agree with other comments that different things turn me on now.  Some touch feels way too aggressive for me and I want a lot more sensual touch and less rough and tumble sweaty sex.  I have become more vocal and assertive during sex on what I want, what feels good and I ask my husband a lot more about his pleasure.  This has been hard for him too and I want him to know I value his pleasure as much as my own.  I have tried a lot of lubes, vaginal creams, suppositories etc.. some work better than others, but experimenting felt good and sexual to me.  I also was very open about it.  The first time I flew with lube in my baggie of toiletries my husband was aghast.  I told him I am not embarrassed to use lube and he needed to get a grip.  Now we shop for lube together and I have a few different that we use.  Sex is not what it used to be, but I am back to enjoying it and loving the connection with my spouse."
10jfhyi,"I made a new account to post this (lol?)

You are at 6 grams of testosterone cream. Only 40% (plus/minus/ is absorbed.  I am not on testosterone right now, but when I was, I injected 5-10 mg PER WEEK.   If you get blood testing for free T and E2, it will show you where you are at. 

Here is my stack right now:  (used on a continuous basis) 

Wellbutrin
DHEA
Intra Rosa (DHEA suppository) - every couple of weeks. 

DHEA converts into estradiol and T inside your body. (So it is not appropriate for women with a history of ER/PR breast cancer.) 

Wellbutrin enhances interest in sex. 

For use just before sex, the following can be tried: with exactly the right conditions, the results can be *spectacular*. 

*CBD
*Viagra or Cialis (increased blood flow to clit. Very much worth it)
*Marijuana if legal in your area.

There are some nice rechargable vibrators out there. I like ""the rose"" and ""slim slender g-spot vibrator"" (no name brand) 

You can use the slim vibrator (with lubrication) as part of foreplay, to enhance blood flow to the area. 

Also: erotic reading (Literotica)"
10jfhyi,"I‚Äôm a guy and I‚Äôm in this subreddit to be educated on menopause, my fianc√© is very much in menopause and doesn‚Äôt get horny too often (but she does once in awhile). I‚Äôm not as horny myself but we both know sex is important to a relationship. We don‚Äôt have anywhere near as much sex as we did before menopause but here‚Äôs what we do. We have sex around every other week, we don‚Äôt have foreplay, but we both masturbate in separate rooms to ‚Äúget ready‚Äù. So there‚Äôs the anticipation that it‚Äôs going to happen. Usually takes about ten minutes for her to call me to the bedroom. From there it is amazing sex, I mean really good. I still take it slow when entering and sometimes add a little lube (I truly don‚Äôt think it is necessary but she asks me to so I do) She just started using Vella, I got it for her for Christmas, it‚Äôs a CBD cream and seems to work really well. She seemed wetter (no lube needed) and had her orgasm very quickly, and nearly had a second one. That‚Äôs a rare thing for her."
10jfhyi,"Same here.  For us it‚Äôs been the right lube, a massage or some kind of foreplay and something hot on tv.  We also set aside time which is necessary given all of life‚Äôs other demands. Intimacy is a critical part of marriage so it really does need to be prioritized.  Then you do the best you can."
10jfhyi,"           You had me at *a number of cats*

My situation is different in that I‚Äôm separated (unrelated to sex), but I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to have sex as often regardless.  I still masturbate with a vibrator ‚Äî not so big on poor, but I love imagining myself in scenes."

I haven‚Äôt tried it but her and her guest said in their experience they seem to have a 60% success rate.

So he helps me by getting me to think about sex by grabbing my butt in the kitchen, or sending me flirty texts during the day. It gets me thinking about sex and gearing up for it.

10jfhyi,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs allowed to mention other groups but there is a group on Facebook that talks about all these hormone issues and has a health practitioner and HRT educator to answer questions. Your hormones have to be balanced in order for the testosterone to work, progesterone also helps with sex drive, you can buy a cream online, that‚Äôs actually what my gyno told me to do at first. I am now taking estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and estradiol for vaginal atrophy and feel better than I have in a long time‚Ä¶ working out even! I would tell everyone here, please start googling and reading about hrt, educate yourself, the doctors don‚Äôt care bcuz they will just prescribe bandaids but not address the real problem so you must be your own advocate. You can message me if you would like Facebook group name as I‚Äôm not sure I am allowed to put it here?? If I am allowed I am happy to do so, I think it would help so many people. Best of luck to you!"
10jfhyi,"OP-you described me, my husband and relationship to a tee!! 33 yrs here , painful sex and absolutely no libido. It‚Äôs frustrating for sure."
10jfhyi,"Just had hysterectomy about 5 months ago. Had libido issues before surgery but still somewhat the same after. As far as antidepressants go, Wellbutrin has helped with my libido. There are studies that it does help to increase sex drive and orgasm and it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not a cure but can help. Only 5-10 years ago (I‚Äôm 46) I was in my prime- not like my 20‚Äôs but it was good. Now, it‚Äôs non-existent at times. I‚Äôm remarried (sorta newlyweds- we married in 2018) and his drive hasn‚Äôt wavered at all, he‚Äôs 51. I want to be where I was when we first started dating and even years after but I can‚Äôt get there and it makes me irritated and sad. I mean, is it really over at 46! üòë so many changes that I feel is happening so fast and there isn‚Äôt really a whole lot they can do for us. My gynecologist told me to ‚Äúgo on a date‚Äù with my husband. I almost lost my mind and she‚Äôs a woman. That ain‚Äôt the cure, sister! So furious. Just want my old body back."
10jfhyi,"Check out the book *Better Sex Through Mindfulness,* by Dr. Lori Brotto"
10jfhyi,Can a lubricant work for atrophy?
10jfhyi,"So many excellent responses!!! When we go through this journey - estrogen goes down and so does oxytocin - the bonding neurotransmitter / hormone. This causes us to lose our interest and sexual enjoyment. MHT can absolutely help, especially a patch or the ring because chances are more of the estrogen receptors will be turned back on -especially the ones in the brain. They will then signal the hypothalamus to make more oxytocin and the pituitary will store for release. 
Someone mentioned sensate focusing, and that‚Äôs a great idea- you can also practice ‚Äúhugging till relaxed‚Äù from the book passion marriage. This exercise bring a sense of feeling fully grounded in yourself while giving and receiving a hug for 2 minutes. 

Some studies say that oxytocin can be boosted from 6-20 seconds. But if you want to try the 2 min hug you can hug through the discomfort and then start to feel your breasts on his body, his belly pressed to yours, the contour of his pants agains your pelvis. Your hands on his back, his muscles. His breath on your neck. His smells. Him taking in yours. 
You get the idea and this happens while you both are fully dressed."
10jfhyi,Imvexxy is literally a miracle drug for vaginal atrophy AND sex drive. I would recommend you ask your doctor about it.
10jfhyi,"I had no sex drive for about 2 years. I responded if things got going but it just wouldn‚Äôt occur to me to initiate because I felt no desire. 

I was having other medical issues & some blood work came back showing I was dangerously deficient in some minerals & vitamins & on the very low end of normal on others.  I had to have 2 rounds of iron infusions, was prescribed a daily folic acid, a weekly B12 injection & had to meet with a nutritionist to overhaul my diet & make sure I was eating enough nutrients (added nuts & seeds for zinc & magnesium, increased my dairy intake because I had cut back) & add some OTC supplements (multivitamin, calcium chew with vitamins D3 & K ) 

It took about 3 weeks to feel better & 6 months to get me back to normal. The libido came back & then some. It fluctuates between normal for me & 1000 because hormones 

So if hormone replacement isn‚Äôt working then do a blood test to check your micronutrients & try changing your diet up

As for the atrophy‚Äîlook for a daily lubricant/moisturizer with hyaluronic acid in it. It helps to heal atrophy. You may still need to use another type of lubricant for sex, but hey that‚Äôs ok, sometimes your partner may need that blue pill"
10jfhyi,Of course your libido left-your hormones left with it! Well hormones left before libido.  It‚Äôs all hormones-find a good dr.  I thought I did but he was all about the  money-there are a lot out there that are dr or Nurse practitioners that want to do it privately and pay them $100 a month to keep them on call and prescribe hormones that regular drs won‚Äôt for various reasons.  GOOD REASONS. My sex drive has gone back to age 10!! Because I am 53 and there are no hormones-I am in menopause.  I have a couple of drinks to relax and let my husband have a good time.  Not his fault-he is the most incredible man o have meant-but his drs prescribed testosterone!
10jfhyi,"Find a form of physical touch that is not sexual but is still enjoyable for your both, and then try that for a while. Head massage can be very loving and intimate, for instance.

If that goes well, then after a while, you can try body massage, and again start it just as an end in itself. If it turns into sexy massage and then sex, that's great, and if it doesn't but it's a really nice way to connect and relax, that's also lovely. If you want to make it back massage only so that you're not lying there unable to relax in case it feels like you're getting groped, do that.

(I'm severely disabled, it's always affected my sex life, you learn a lot of ways to deal with it.)"
10jfhyi,"I have a suggestion. Give him a blow job. My libido is non-existent right now, his, after a prolonged illness, is pretty strong. He'll be doing the dishes (always a turn on), and I'll sneak up behind him, wrap my arms around him and whisper in his ear ""if you go take a quick shower, I'll suck your..."" (BTW, I say this whatever he's doing...I require  squeaky clean...and he's too busy running to the shower to be offended..lol) His ego gets a boost (I ""pursued"" him), and he gets sexual release. Honestly, sometimes, because I'm in charge of what is going on (there is cuddling, kissing, fondling...kinda reminds me of teenage years when intercourse is off the table...lol) I get aroused...but still don't try intercourse. Instead, we 69. 

Been married 34 years. Sex is important. I was on ""the other side"" when hubby was extremely sick and we didn't have sex for years. I knew there was a medical reason...but it still made me feel unattractive and unloved (no logic I know, it still hurt to feel rejected). All I know is afterwards, hubby feels like the sexiest guy alive (I've overheard him bragging to his buddy how i couldn't keep my hands off him)."

10jfhyi,Ok thank god the low sex drive thing is normal. I don‚Äôt want to tell my partner that my desire is not the same as it was.  I hope this passes. Sorry that you are dealing with this it really does affect every aspect of your life.  I hope your hubby will understand that currently you are going through a period in life  that you are struggling to understand also.  As hallmark cheesy as this sounds this parts not forever.

10jfhyi,I‚Äôm sorry.  Just want to say I hardly ever have an organs outside of mast.  I still enjoy sex with my husband and don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs the end of the world.  He takes care of me I just normally can‚Äôt do it the other way but I still enjoy being close to him
10jfhyi,"Something that has been interesting for me is becoming more open with my husband.  I know hubby enjoys porn, most men do, so I decided to get interested in it. I can only take so much (of his porn prefernces) but I also like to talk to him about what turns him on. Is it the hot women or more what they are doing? Who would he do if he could do anyone and why? Is there some kink that he has always had in his fantasies? 

I found out some things that turn hubby on... it was fun (and weird LOL) even though they all didn't turn me on. But the funny thing is, after decades of marriage, I learned so many new things about him, and him about me! It also gave me the courage to open up about some of the things I did and do fantsize about. Things I have repressed, and he has repressed.  

I know this doesn't directly help you since your libido is at zero.  But it might open up conversations with him. Giving him some alone time with his computer and he has your permission in a way. If there is a sock on the bedroom doorknob, don't come knocking!  Him knowing you know what he is doing in there might be kind of hot for him. Maybe you might even give him some room to explore his fantasies safely online. You could  go to a sex shop with him, research his fantasies... does he secretly like butt stuff... his own or always wanted to take one... you could buy him a butt plug or a prostate toy as a gift with a wink.  Learn what other men with his likes like and tell him about it. This way you are part of it, and its fun, maybe he will talk to you about it too and it won't be so hush hush.

Sorry, I got rambling. This is all coming from a woman who had the opposite problem in her late 40's and my libido spiked! Conversation opened between me and my husband and we have learned so much about each other. It has been fun, embarrassing, and eye opening lol."
10jfhyi,"Hi i am NOT in menapause or close but i am on here trying to help my partially blind aunt i just posted a few minutes ago on here and hopefully we can get some answers for her..

They try to watch porn and masturbate all the time as it wakes up the ""V"" they said...Also these friends are not married but they swore that everyone in this situation needs a younger man as the attraction and adventure will make those juices flow again!! Most younger men that i have met are not ""picky"" i found older men are pickier on what they want there woman to look like, etc...(No offense older guys some are super cool)Im not in menapause age but i only date younger men they are so exciting and adventurous and always up to haveing sex! Good luck!"
10jfhyi,"Have you considered letting him get his needs met elsewhere? I know it's not an easy thing to think about it, but it may be what you need. Many couples consider this option when their libidos no longer align."
10jfhyi,"Chiming in about toys and vibrators in particular...  The first vibe I ever bought was a Hitachi Magic Wand, and it is still my hands-down favorite.  I've always used it for its actual massage purpose - on my neck or back or other tight muscles - as well as for my clit (and I also have a dildo attachment for it).  A great thing about doing it that way is a  lot of times once I've been using it for massage that gets me more into sensation in general, and from there it's a smaller step to using it on sensitive bits.

You could also check out ""Oh Joy Sex Toy"" https://www.ohjoysextoy.com for lots of stories and reviews of toys, to get a sense of what you might be interested in.  (I'm not that into a lot of the stories, as sex is not super interesting to me anymore either, but it's great to read reviews of toys and and get a sense of what different people liked or didn't like about them.)  I'm sure everyone's experience is different, but for me the worst of the change seems to be over.  I had pain with intercourse for a while - enough that it was off the table most of the time - and although my libido is still crap, it's easier and rarely painful now.  Staying in ""practice"" helped, I think, and estrogen cream did too, which I think others have suggested."
10jfhyi,Uberlube.  It‚Äôs the best imho.
10jfhyi,"Sex shop shopping with my future partner is on my list of dates I want to experience with him. Yes, please. The idea sounds so intimate and sensual. 

I'm a 39 gay male and I lost libido completely for like 3 years, and it's finally returned. The idea of going to the sex shop together makes me very comfortable in my sexuality again. I've never done it, and a few years ago would have passed on the idea completely, but now I can't wait to do it."
10jfhyi,"Uhmm. Okay, I‚Äôm 42 also‚Äîand if I went to dinner with my dearest of friends + they mostly talked about sex the ENTIRE time, I‚Äôd be hustling to change that subject after about 5 min. Yawwwn. That sounds like the most unappealing convo ever‚Äîand, I would encourage you not to take their current obsessions as a personal shortcoming. 

I‚Äôve always had a generally lower libido, and honestly, at best I am aroused enough for sex 1 to maybe 2x per month. And yet! Because it‚Äôs much more important for my husband, as his primary form of feeling connected, we try to have a set day of the week we that dedicate to the act of intimacy. 

It‚Äôs not really ever that sexy having this on a calendar, but it‚Äôs a: therapist encouraged, all across the board; b: ensures his needs feel met in that regard + c: being a set plan [minus sicknesses or, say, bad headaches] means I can try to mentally get myself there, in that space, on that day each week. It works for us + it is more than enough for me. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The thought of being so much into sex again that it‚Äôs a daily or multiple times a week gig honestly invokes an  ‚ÄúUgggh‚Äù response from me.

10jfhyi,Emily Nagoski is great. She has a podcast by the same name and is working on a book called ‚ÄúCome Together‚Äù for couples in long term relationships.
10jfhyi,"This is just an idea that popped in my head when reading your comment. Whether it will work or not, I don't know.

You and your husband could try the supplement(s) l-arginine or l-citruline or the combo (I am not well versed here, but people that take it often take both and it has something to do with adapting to the l-arginine rather quickly). Those amino acids work to increase vasodilation and blood flow, men sometimes use it for a sexual boost to get harder. Think viagra lite. Probably extra lite as its a supplement and not prescription so I wouldn't be surprised if your husband has ED it can't do enough.

Of course check there aren't any health risks - iirc it works by increasing nitrous oxide which is probably safe, but a small number of health conditions would contraindicate it.

For you it might work because blood flow to our lady parts goes down as well with age and menopause. More specifically, I started taking l-arginine to deal with some circulation issue in my hands and feet, as I have raynaud's syndrome and I'm on a couple medications that cause vasoconstriction. Imagine my surprise when in addition to increased blood flow to my hands, my lady parts were also getting their share and I was lucky there wasn't a single guy around to drag back to my apartment (ok not really, but it did increase my libido for a few hours, and i suspect that was because blood flow to our genitals also happens during arousal and I was conflating the two).

I don't think that will be enough for you given what you'd described. It sounds like you will need hrt of some sort, but this could be a starting point to just test the waters and at least see how you two are feeling with increased blood flow. Its a small effect, and it doesn't last long - its more often used as a pre-workout. Maybe it will do nothing. But it's cheap and walmart even sells l-arginine. If it does get things moving in the right direction, you can finish him with your hands and then consider how aggressively you want to treat the genital symptoms and he can revisit pharmaceutical solutions for ED.

10jfhyi,"I just said this in my comment to the OP & I‚Äôve said it here before in the past & I know I sound like a broken record or the hammer that thinks all problems are nails. 

But you said something that set warning bells off in my head:  you said you‚Äôre so exhausted you barely have the energy to function 

When I felt like that, it turned out I had severe vitamin & mineral deficiencies that were caused by a combination of meds I was taking & my changing hormones & that I have general inflammation which may be autoimmune related 

In addition to the deficiencies we discovered that I have a genetic blood disorder that causes my chronic anemia. I‚Äôm missing a couple of genes that help create red blood cells & don‚Äôt produce enough red blood cells & I don‚Äôt absorb iron through food or oral supplements as well as most people. 

Anyway, the doctor ran a blood test to check my micronutrients & discovered I was low on folate, iron, B12, zinc, magnesium, Vitamin D, Vitamin K, calcium.   

I was prescribed a few supplements for the ones I was dangerously low on & a meeting with a nutritionist to overhaul my diet to eat more of the nutrients I was on the low end of normal on & recommended a few more OTC supplements to take to boost the ones I was on the low end of normal on 

It took about 3 weeks to feel better (the first couple of weeks I actually felt worse but that was just me starting to feel better & realizing just how bad off I was‚Äîwalking across the room became an ordeal) it was 6 months before I was normal for me & the sex drive came back 


If you haven‚Äôt had any blood work done recently go get checked out & get your thyroid checked too."
10jfhyi,"I‚Äôm a man with a wife in menopause and she doesn‚Äôt seem to want sex much anymore either. I also have erection problems but I take viagra when the time comes, which is getting less and less frequent lol. There‚Äôs no shame in taking the pill, he should get some pills and not worry about it. I can‚Äôt deal with not being hard enough to perform, nothing worse than that imo. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs embarrassing, not taking viagra"
10jfhyi,"My partner has the same issues with staying hard, I made him an appointment with his GP and he run all the usual tests to rule out any underlying factors for the impotence. It was found that he has a partial blockage in his vein in the left side of his groin. We saw a vascular specialist who said that it can play a part in his problems but it‚Äôs not the whole reason for it. Both the GP and the specialist said some forms of impotency are related to the mind and to the relationship. I was involved in an aggravated burglary and a man was in our home with a knife, I went into a deep depression, had severe PTSD and anxiety and I shut down, this affected our marriage to the point that I almost left him. After intense therapy and counseling for myself, I am finally healing and he has stuck by me all the way through. I blame myself for his impotency and that‚Äôs been a hard pill to swallow. We have been married 30 years this year and talking openly about things has helped a lot, we went together to a adult toy shop, bought things that we thought would help and they have. 

I also use a vaginal estrogen every second day and that has helped immensely with the vaginal dryness, maybe see if you can find a woman‚Äôs specialist who would be happy to prescribe it for you. I don‚Äôt know where you live, some countries you can buy vaginal estrogen without a prescription. Good luck my fellow meno friend !"
10jfhyi,What is estring?
10jfhyi,"I found a strain called Cream Soda OG that helps me. It's hard to find so I ration it. My adult son house sat for us once and got into my stash and smoked it all. He couldn't understand why I was so mad since it's legal here and I could ""just buy more"". I told him it's hard to find, it's ""special"", and his dad was gonna be mad, too. (My husband doesn't even smoke pot. haha)"
10jfhyi,THC edibles.  Life changing.
10jfhyi,Same
10jfhyi,"We used that too and it really made a big difference! It was like remapping what felt good for both of us. I‚Äôm 52 and married almost 25 years. 

I‚Äôve always had the higher libido than my husband and infertility caused by issues with him really hit him mentally very hard. It wasn‚Äôt a dead bedroom situation but not far from it. 

But Sensate Focus was a great way to find new ways to relate. And the warmth and kindness of it all made him be able to tell me he was taking cialis. Which I was so happy to know - in my book, it was great he cared enough to do that and I was glad healthwise to know too. And the biggie - I realized he was nervous about performance and needed some time for it to kick in. Maybe that‚Äôs just mental but if it is what he needs, I‚Äôm happy to know! 

The sensate focus and sharing was so much fun by the third session we couldn‚Äôt help having sex - like fun, warm good sex. 

It‚Äôs been almost two years now since then and we are still having a lot of fun. Now we schedule sex so we have a baseline date for sure and he doesn‚Äôt feel rushed. If I want unscheduled sex, I just know to give him a bit of extra time. 

And the sex is different but so are we. Sensate Focus really has been such a game changer."
10jfhyi,"You might want to go through a domestic abuse checklist, hon. This is setting off red flags."
10jfhyi,This is one of the best comments I‚Äôve seen about this topic yet.  Communication is absolutely critical along with a mutual understanding.  I can‚Äôt emphasize that second point enough.  There are too many recommendations here from women suggesting husbands should just go pound sand. Really?  Is that a legitimate approach to any aspect of a relationship?  You‚Äôve found a way to be creative and compromise.  I‚Äôm sure that just the sheer effort and concern you are demonstrating means the world to your husband.
10jfhyi,"EXCELLENT reply! I agree with all of this. 

I'd add a few things:

It took a lot of communicating, but we got to where my libido issues were OUR problem to tackle, not MY problem to tackle. I asked my husband to be my teammate in figuring out what works for me/us in this new reality of menopause. I tell him everything about how my body is changing. I tell him things I learn from here and from doctors. He's fully invested in OUR future as intimate partners, so I am too. I refuse to just give up and force him into a sexless marriage. 

Porn: OnlyFans is good, but I found the porn that helped ME as well as him, was found on MakeLoveNotPorn.com  The website was founded by a woman, and the content is very REAL and it doesn't cater to the standard porn male POV. I highly suggest trying it for a month. Choose what to watch together. Communicate ahead of time and establish that watching together does NOT mean that penetrative sex will happen.

Oral sex: ESSENTIAL. Create boundaries ahead of time if no other touch is welcome. Even if I can't find the will to receive, I give, because my husband is a wonderful, sexy man and it makes me happy to make him happy that way (when I'm up for it.) It isn't expected weekly, but I try to make it happen once a week or so.

I have found that taking PIV sex off the table for some intimate times takes the pressure off, therefore leading to me actually getting aroused. My husband can say, ""Can I give you a massage tonight while watching some porn?"" and I'm happy to say yes because I'm only expected to lie there and receive his touch. It often leads to more than that, but not always. I can't say how VALUABLE it is that he's okay with stopping anytime I call things off. I don't feel like I'm going to be resented for it. It's freeing!

I also believe that you must use it so you don't lose it. I don't say that because it's my vagina's job to be available to my husband. I say that because I've experienced the physical changes that occur when you don't use your clitoris or have **some** penetration.

I've discovered that estrogen cream is my friend, and so is good lube and a toy or two. I DO NOT expect myself to masturbate with certain frequency, but if I don't do it at least once a week, I notice that it's more difficult to get aroused the next time.

My overall advice is to communicate A LOT, make your husband your partner in this journey, keep ""using it"" while also taking the pressure off yourself about penetration and frequency. Once I stopped stressing out about ""He wants sex and it hurts and I don't want it!"" I was able to concentrate on INTIMACY and connecting with the man that loves me exactly as I am.

Good luck!"
10jfhyi,"Great response. Use it or lose it is so true, even if it‚Äôs just bullet vibrators and lots of lube to keep tissue(s) conditioned‚Ä¶"
10jfhyi,"Of course your doc doesn‚Äôt getting any fees from recommending/prescribing testosterone. Pellets is a money maker for the provider. Not saying it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve just stated to really look closely at why docs recommend certain things (or in this case tells you creams/oral don‚Äôt work)"
10jfhyi,"I get Bio-te pellets and my sex drive is the highest its been.  Also, THC gummies, game changer."
10jfhyi,"Those pellets aren't available from proper doctors because they're awful. The dose is way too high, leading to a variety of nasty side effects, including increased cardiovascular risk. Also if they cause masculinising effects, such as male pattern baldness or voice deepening, those will be permanent."
10jfhyi,"Same! Together 25yrs, married 18, no kids, a number of cats. Definitely browse incognito mode too. Lolol"
10jfhyi,Oh god.  Gay porn.  the guys grunting and groaning.
10jfhyi,"I find the porn has worked as well.  I don‚Äôt like most of it, so we go get female friendly but it does get things going along with a little foreplay."
10jfhyi,"Completely agree.  Setting aside time is very important, otherwise it can just never happen.  Also, they say use it or lose it.  So I find having a regular cadence is very helpful.  We try weekly.  Sometime there‚Äôs an extra bonus thrown in‚Ä¶"
10jfhyi,"Usually not just because of this op has recognised the issue and talked about it some people ignore it and pretend that they never used to enjoy the intimacy that you once did . In my case menopause has changed my wife into someone else, we used to do so much together gym, cycling socialising, now she‚Äôs too tired to do anything and just sits playing candy crush, sorry to vent on here but it‚Äôs hard sometimes, been together 32 years and now almost strangers,"
10jfhyi,DHEA cream has helped atrophy and dryness.
10jfhyi,I‚Äôm sending you a message for that info!
10jfhyi,Not really. It helps make things more comfortable but it doesn‚Äôt restore tissue. Estrogen (even just locally) is needed.
10jfhyi,"Totally agree. Game changer but yeah, I still have a low libido issue as well as OP."
10jfhyi,First time I went to look for toys for hubby I was embarrassed but today I wasn‚Äôt.  It was actually nice to be able to talk with someone in person who could answer a few questions.  Walked out with new toy for me and better lube.
10jfhyi,"Thank you for this! We too set aside a sex day, once a week. For the very reasons you mention. At first it pist me off, but i have to try to accommodate him, as he still wants sex, and I could care less, but it also makes us feel connected, so we set a day 1 time a week, which seems to be a good balance. I don‚Äôt really want it, but I want a happy husband, and I have a great life. Unlike you, I used to have a great sex drive, and honestly, I miss wanting to have sex. Oh well. I did order those ‚Äòin the mood‚Äô pills another commentator mentioned. So ü§û.  So thanks for reinforcing what I am doing. It makes me feel not so alone and weird."
10jfhyi,"I am grateful that my husband also has ‚Äúissues‚Äù due to his prescription of antidepressants. I couldn‚Äôt handle these sex appointments, sounds like a nightmare to me tbh. But we all have to do what works I guess - I‚Äôd much rather listen to my friends gabble on about their sex lives than schedule sex with my husband. üòÖ"
10jfhyi,"Yes! I love having scheduled days. I never just randomly get aroused so knowing Wednesday is sex day helps me a lot! I make sure I have a good workout that day. It really seems to help. And I can ""pre game"" in the shower. I find if I have one orgasm there it's easier to enjoy and maybe have another during PIV later."
10jfhyi,"Piggy backing off this comment, I started taking the supplement called In the Mood from Rae Wellness at the end of December, which has L-arginine, maca, ashwagandha, and ginseng, and it has really made a huge difference! I still haven't been able to orgasm, but I‚Äôm wet and sex feels good again. I wouldn‚Äôt say my drive is back, but I don‚Äôt dread sex anymore and unless I'm exhausted, I look forward to it again. I had previously tried the Olly Lovin' Libido gummies, but they didn't do anything for me at all. I've also tried a few different lubes, nada. The In the Mood supplements work so well that I've set up an auto shipment to keep them coming."
10jfhyi,Thank you so very much!! I truly appreciate your wonderful response. I will look into this. This sub has awesome people!!
10jfhyi,Thanks so much!!
10jfhyi,This is very helpful. Thanks a million.!
10jfhyi,Second Vagifem low.  Really really helps.
10jfhyi,Thank you. Is there a blood pressure worry with it?
10jfhyi,"Thank you so much for sharing your story and your support. I'm sorry for your traumatic experience.  Bravo to you for working it out. 

I am in therapy for myself. We are learning to talk about things.  I don't think there are any toy shops around here, but we have looked online. His doc offered him the blue pill, he is willing to try it. I will tell him about having his doctor check things out.

I have an Rx for the creme, but it didn't seem to help and it made my tissues bleed. I have an appt with my doctor shortly. 

BTW our two cats were named Pip & Squeak!"
10jfhyi,estrogen ring insert. You insert in your vagina and leave it there for 90 days where it continuously releases a low dose of estrogen.
10jfhyi,LOL. Tell him why and he will never smoke any of your weed ever again.
10jfhyi,"What kind do you use? Are they legal? I live in Florida, so it‚Äôs sort of legal..I‚Äôd have to get a medical card if this isn‚Äôt something you can get OTC. Thanks in advance!"
10jfhyi,"Oh I know, he‚Äôs a selfish alcoholic.  I have a therapist and I attend alanon."
10jfhyi,"Use it or lose it is a crock designed to yet again make women take the blame.

Here is a great article by an expert in womens health and specifically menopause who addresses it.

10jfhyi,"I spent 44 years dealing with crappy doctors. I lost my fertility due to crappy doctors. 

Every visit with my doctor is at least 45 minutes. I have his full attention and I‚Äôm never rushed, shamed, or doubted. I leave more educated than I was when I arrived. 

After decades of (not) patching symptoms and being treated like crap, I‚Äôm finally healthy! We found the root causes of everything and found ways to heal me. 

If I had this doctor 15 years ago, I might have biological children. 

Annually, the pellet costs nearly nothing compared to any other medication I‚Äôve ever been on. 

He found a way to get an extremely expensive but extremely effective nervous system medication for me for free. 

I don‚Äôt want to die anymore. 

I tried the cream, the pills, you name it - I tried it. They didn‚Äôt work. This does. Objectively. Ask my husband, my family, my friends, my co-workers. I have my light back. 

I hope to god he makes money from it. I hope he makes a shit-ton from it. I want him to be rich and happy and healthy. All the doctors that rushed me out of 15 minute meetings with crappy prescriptions that didn‚Äôt work can go to hell."
10jfhyi,üòÇ when your cats think the vibrator is a toy for them!
10jfhyi,"I like to be able to picture myself in the porn, but hey whatever works! The men are usually 10000x hotter in gay male porn too!"
10jfhyi,"Right? as visual people just looking at something can spark a tingle. But yeah, then there is the dark side and you unwittingly are going to see some shit you wished you didn't know existed...and then wonder how it does. But there's great ethical porn or anime out there! I've found I've got kinks I never knew were even a thing!!"
10jfhyi,"I understand it's difficult seeing another side of someone you know well. Perimenopause/ menopause changes a lot in a woman's brain. We do sometimes just have zero motivation and don't want to change it. I'm sure it is hard to see her playing one Candy Crush game after another, but eventually she won't. 


Could be worse, my dude-- she could've been a Redecor player and spent all her time bitching about the changes the new company made, and now spends all her time between Reddit and Live Play Bingo... whoops, sorry, that's me."
10jfhyi,"Thank you for sharing your experience. Both partners are affected by peri/menopause, so I appreciated reading your feelings."
10jfhyi,This seems like the wrong space for you to vent about your wife who is suffering from menopausal symptoms.
10jfhyi,"It‚Äôs given me energy and toughened up my thinning skin. I think it‚Äôs helping with moisture but the gynatrof definitely
Does"
10jfhyi,"Aww, that's fun! I enjoy when others provide comfortable guidance. It always makes me feel more confident, especially if it's my partner! Sounds like you and the hubs had a really cute date together."
10jfhyi,"It‚Äôs great when they‚Äôre helpful. Last time I went in a sex store the woman was high af and trauma dumped on me about her poor dear 28yr old young teenage son who was being  accused of üò≥, but he was just into rough sex you know‚Ä¶ I was just standing there like lady, I‚Ä¶ üò≥üò≥üò≥"
10jfhyi,"To be fair, it‚Äôs also a time we set aside where some emotional connection can happen, because that‚Äôs where the intimacy lies for ME‚Äîwith his stressful job, plus two young-ish kids, there are fewer opportunities for that during daylight hours‚Äîand I almost always get a lovely massage out of the deal, too. 

Those pieces feel worth the weekly the date for me [I have a pretty ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù partner, too]. It may not be everyone‚Äôs cuppa tea, and yeah it is 100% unsexy, but it works for us!"
10jfhyi,Wow that‚Äôs interesting they should start telling women about this stuff from a younger age
10jfhyi,Thank you also!!
10jfhyi,Just ordered some-praying it helps! Can I ask when you take them? Morning? Night? Or right before trying to get into the mood?
10jfhyi,I got them!!! How long did it take for you to feel a difference?
10jfhyi,"It lowers bp and does speed heart up a little for a short time but not that bad. I am on high bp meds too, doesn‚Äôt cause any probs and I‚Äôve been taking viagra for 10 years. It def works haha never goes limp during sec with those. 50 mg is plenty strong enough too"
10jfhyi,"Hubby also tried medication although it wasn‚Äôt the blue pill, it was another type, it was a bit hit and miss to be honest, but it‚Äôs worth a try. It‚Äôs good you are having therapy, as it‚Äôs a safe place to talk without judgement and having someone who is impartial certainly helps. I hope things work out for you and you both get to enjoy life more. Thanks for your kind words and I love the names of your kitties. We lost our fur baby last June and he is so missed, life is empty without him.

Edit to add : I use a vaginal pessary called vagifem, I found it better than the cream. Maybe that is available where you live."
10jfhyi,Does this interfere with sex? Oral sex?
10jfhyi,Is it ok for my husband to be exposed to it?
10jfhyi,Might never smoke *any* weed again lol
10jfhyi,"Sod them, leave if you need to! Some people are genuinely unable to leave an abusive partner (disabled people may be reliant on their partner for survival as well as financially stuck, for instance), but in more cases, it's feasible but just seems really difficult to manage."
10jfhyi,"The physical changes that occur when I don't ""use it"" are noticable. It's not about being available to a man, it's about not allowing my vagina to atrophy (even more.) Along with vaginal estrogen cream, my actual feeling inside my vagina is improved with somewhat regular penetration. My clitoris is more responsive when I use it regularly. 

I get what you're trying to say, but there's medical, physical reasons to continue clitoral and vaginal stimulation. Patriarchy can't be blamed for that."
10jfhyi,"It‚Äôs behind a paywall, but several other sources including ob-gyns, pelvic floor physical therapists and  the Mayo Clinic support regular sexual activity to maintain elasticity of thinning vaginal walls.  I follow that author on Tik Tok and I have disagreed with other information she has passed along.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs shaming or blaming women at all, I think it‚Äôs just a fact of life. The ‚Äúuse‚Äù can be self love or partner love by the way, it has nothing to do with taking away a woman‚Äôs choice in that department."
10jfhyi,"Look, I not trying to promote the patriarchy, okay? I just noticed that my vaginal opening closed up tighter than a baby bird‚Äôs butthole after about a few months of no penetration of any kind. Got to where he couldn‚Äôt have fingered me with his pinky if I would‚Äôve wanted it, okay? My entire comment was oriented around practical, logistical info that OP could use right away to make a small difference in her marriage. 

Concurrently to the tightening of my vaginal opening, my labia minora and the remnants of my hymen became extremely delicate and fragile. Using toys on myself while using estrogen cream (not at the same time) also helped me regain some sensation and therefore some desire. It also helped me not get UTIs constantly. Turns out the tissues in my urethra were more prone to infection in their atrophied state. So bringing more blood circulation to the area helped my health, as well as my marriage. 

I know you probably just wanted to have a hot take for some upvotes or whatever, but you weren‚Äôt really accomplishing anything here."
10jfhyi,I don‚Äôt like the girl noises 90% of the time.  Huh.  Haven‚Äôt tried visualizing myself in the scene.  Something new to try as I‚Äôm trying to wean myself off Benadryl as a sleep aid.
10jfhyi,I got a little abuse for my comments sorry if I offended anyone there‚Äôs probably a few husbands on this forum trying hard to understand what‚Äôs happening to their wife
10jfhyi,Fair comment I was trying to answer the question of why people divorce and it‚Äôs not just the sex. It‚Äôs hard for both parties especially without good communication
10jfhyi,I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  Good luck!
10jfhyi,I literally felt things stirring the same day. It took a few more days after that to feel mostly normal. Good luck!
10jfhyi,"Check out this new study that shows it also helps men live longer. I'm not kidding, 100% serious. I would never have guessed it would have such benefits."
10jfhyi,Thanks so much. I'll deliver that message to my hubs!!
10jfhyi,"Oh thank you for the vag tip, as well as your kind words!
Yes we lost both of them four months apart. As happens with cats, they were fine until something came up then they went downhill immediately.  The pain was unbearable. I so miss seeing furry greetings run up to me when I come home. And a thousand other fur things."
10jfhyi,"No, it does not."
10jfhyi,"The pamphlet says its ok for partners to be exposed to it, but you can remove it if you choose to. I was honestly a bit surprised as they tell you not to let the cream anywhere near your partner."
10jfhyi,"Just one part of it

""Use it of Lose It is a patriarchal myth. The ‚Äútheory‚Äù is friction from the penis increases blood flow and that helps the tissues. There is no supporting data except a bad study from the 1981. First of all, if regular vaginal intercourse with a penis preserved vaginal health then no woman would ever present with pain who is having regular sex. I was having regular sex and developed GUSM! I never believed the myth, but it is pretty clear the person who dreamed this up did not have a vagina and go through menopause. Secondly, the study from 1981 involved 24 women women in menopause who were having regular sex and 21 who were not. Obviously, those women who had more pain would be having less sex, so there would be more pain in the no sex group. There was no statistically significant difference between how the tissues looked between women having sex and those who were not! This is a really important point, meaning the study did not even show what people claim. There were some differences in hormone levels between the two groups and somehow that was interpreted as sex protecting the vagina. It is enraging.

A study from 2017 looked at over 800 women, and specifically looked at what their tissues looked like under the microscope. That gives us a a good idea if the tissues have estrogen or not. There was no difference between women who were having sex and those who were not. If sex protected the tissues and reversed the changes of menopause, there would be a difference. It is true that when there is significant inflammation in the vagina from a skin condition called lichen planus that regular penetration, with a penis or a vibrator/dildo, can help keep the vagina open in combination with appropriate medical care. Here the penetration is separating the tissues, because in these conditions the inflammation can cause the walls of the vagina to stick together. But that isn‚Äôt the same as menopause.

What protects the tissues and helps prevent the changes of GUSM isn‚Äôt a penis, it‚Äôs estrogen or vaginal DHEA. That is if you need it. Some women tell me they do just fine with vaginal moisturizers."""
10jfhyi,"I dont post anything for upvotes, and given most of us here in this sub are not at the age where we would even care about upvotes your comment says a lot about you.

If it works for you, great. No woman should suffer.

I was correcting some wrong info and I will not apologise for that."
10jfhyi,I love imagining myself in scenes.  It really helps me.
10jfhyi,"OMG the noises!  And then the constant zooming in on the privates.  Such a turn off.  We actually find that we both get more turned on the more realistic it is.  Even if it is soft core, my husband says the realism or the situation can really be a turn on.  I find that too."
10jfhyi,I watch porn on mute.  I also prefer short videos rather than scenes that are acted out or where they constantly change positions.  It's too distracting.
10jfhyi,"It‚Äôs peculiar, we want men to understand yet not REALLY be part of the discussion. It‚Äôs disheartening for me to read the abuse too."

The elusive Perimenopausal Woman is difficult to spot out in the wild. Leaving her comfortable abode requires a level of motivation and pants that are not always available. 

Watch this rare sighting, as the Perimenopausal Woman emerges into the open, blinking and disoriented, whether from tiredness or sunlight is impossible to discern. She has emerged to forage for sustenance, or to escort her young to a school event. She keeps to herself while away from her shelter, snarling at anyone foolish enough to get close enough to talk to her. 

Sustenance gathered, the Perimenopausal Woman retreats back to comfort and safety. Will she emerge again this week? Only time will tell.

^^^basically my life, minus the narration"
10e5nc5,"No one was talking about it so I started to. I talk with no care of who is listening or what they might think of the topic. Turns out, it once you allow a space for it, all the stories come out."
10e5nc5,"I started a private Facebook group called ""WTF is happening to our bodies and why aren't we talking about it"" and invited all my female friends 45 and over to join.  It got the conversation going."
10e5nc5,"What I realized is that women are going through it in silence.  When I started telling coworkers and friends about my experience, they started asking questions and telling me they are having symptoms, asking what doctor I use, etc. I think women are used to keeping this topic private and being open is what brings out the conversation."
10e5nc5,"I think a lot of women think that they are the only ones. If you feel like you are losing your mind, and you are in the workforce, you don't want to jeopardize your job by speaking out. It's the same with having depression.  There is a big stigma with that. God help you if you have both. I know, I went through both here in New York State.

I've said many times that we don't have parades or flag colors or ribbons. If we did they would be ultraviolet,  cuz we are invisible!!!!ü§£"
10e5nc5,"Up at 3am but with blind panic upon waking, very hard to calm down. No thought of more sleep!

I have the same experience. I hear about occasional hot flashes and I hear a lot about sleeping ‚Äûworse‚Äú. But I seem to be the only one with consistent waking up, far too little sleep for months and terrible anxiety and brain fog. Tonight I had no idea what day it is‚Ä¶which is a bit annoying if you have to take medicine. It really took me a couple of minutes to sort in my mind.

I still say we really need a discord to chat at night and support each other real time. But I am too badly off to set it off and oversee it. I hope someone does, soon.

We all exist in real life. Well you can recognize me by the dark circles under my eyes, baggy ‚ÄúI dont care‚Äù clothing and standing around wondering what I was supposed to be doing."
10e5nc5,"I still have not found a place to talk about it in person. I have been gaslit and told I was making it up, other women deny it, or I'm even told to just stop talking about it. The first year going through this before finding this sub, I felt so isolated and like I had indeed lost my mind. There is so much support here and it has been a lifeline in an ocean of gaslighters and deniers."
10e5nc5,In Massachusetts having my nightly 330am hot flash!
10e5nc5,"The vast majority have few symptoms, many silently thinking they are going crazy and never saying a thing. It‚Äôs the curious and women suffering inexplicably that find this sub looking for information. 


I am forever going to be grateful to the NHS and welfare of the UK for covering my life expenses and free healthcare the last couple years."
10e5nc5,"Friends of mine are writing a musical so have started a Facebook group called Middle Raged. It's my other go to place to swap stories. The amount of us who have fleeting thoughts of 'where to bury bodies' is astounding. Luckily it's only thoughts, but oomph that rage when it was there. Glad that and the brain fog have passed, just wish the rest would"
10e5nc5,"Whenever I talk to any other woman my age about this I get silence and a blank stare!  I‚Äôm in my 50s!  I‚Äôm so, so thankful for all of you!!!"
10e5nc5,"I don't have a lot of friends. The few I could truly call friends don't live near me, but I did reach out a couple weeks ago and ask their experience and it varies but there were no deniers, thankfully. The one I know was anti-hrt caved and went on it. Wishes she'd've done it years ago. And somehow, as I was going through the checkout line at the grocery store awhile back, the cashier and I started talking about perimenopause and the wish sometimes to just not exist. A few weeks ago she took one look at me and asked if it was a bad day (it was... Let's just say if an oncoming truck crossed the centre line, I wouldn't have swerved.  But being ""seen"" was helpful).


I have a few hot flashes here and there, and tend to be a night owl anyway, so I regularly see 2 or 3am. But for me it's the mental stuff. And layered on top is all this other stuff like long covid, and poverty, and marriage issues, and I'm just so lonely. But frig, I don't want to leave the house. And even going for coffee is a 20 minute drive, we're so far back in the sticks."
10e5nc5,I work remotely and can thankfully lay down with migraines and lack of sleep. Whenever I encounter someone my age on a zoom call I always wonder if they‚Äôre going through it too.
10e5nc5,"I have been thinking about starting a peri/meno support group, like AA, in that we have standing meetings where women can call in and we can share our struggles. We could even have a 3am one, when we are all apparently awake together!"
10e5nc5,I have just the opposite problem. Everyone I know that's near my age has already long since been in menopause. I mention my period and they look at me like I just grew a second head.
10e5nc5,"To be honest, during early perimenopause I gradually lost all my friends groups and haven't had the energy to reconnect or make new ones, so I have zero clue what people are or aren't saying IRL. There's no way to type that that doesn't sound whiny, but it just is what it is. Back when I still spent time around people, nobody was talking about it, but that was almost a decade ago."
10e5nc5,"Yes, yes, 100X this. Plus, all of my friends are somehow at least 10 years younger than I am!!! Anyone in NYC and want to make a new friend? Not kidding. I‚Äôd totally be down for a meetup of honest, like-minded women who want to talk about all of the things. :)"
10e5nc5,"Nope, I‚Äôm a massage therapist. My clients tell me all about especially when I ask. I don‚Äôt feel so alone anymore üòÇ"
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve found Reddit to be a bit more honest than other flavors of ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù where everyone just seems to have everything sorted out. 

There are a lot of us who are sweaty, bitchy, exhausted, bloated, struggling to not lose our temper with lazy partners (or kids), sick parents, mansplaining colleagues or bosses‚Ä¶ because it feels like our bodies have turned against us.

I still have a clear visceral memory of having a panic attack (5 years ago) in the waiting room of a doctor‚Äôs office after taking a call from my sister who told me that our mom had ‚Äúgone off‚Äù again (long story!! Let‚Äôs just mom was a holy terror, a mean narcissistic nightmare that caused endless drama for us in her later years).

The doctor I was waiting to see turned out to be one of those crackpot ‚Äúnatural medicine‚Äù doctors that wanted to sell me $$$$ supplements that I could order online cheaper‚Ä¶ 

So yeah, years of bad doctors, expensive tests, nobody to share my experiences with because my friends in real life are either Boomers who had a different experience or much younger and had not hit the worst of perimenopause.

Welcome to the dark side of the force. We have cookies!!"
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve verbally brought perimenopause up as a discussion with every woman I have any sort of regular contact with or even passing contact with 35 yo and up and every single one of them acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. 

‚ÄòNo, I didn‚Äôt have any symptoms‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat are you going on about?‚Äô, ‚Äòthat didn‚Äôt happen for me‚Äô is all I hear back. Not one single woman would either admit to it or was aware of it. I‚Äôm made to feel like some sort of freak for even bringing it up. I‚Äôm so frustrated. Why won‚Äôt anyone just talk about it?!?"
10e5nc5,I am fortunate to have a friend who went through it without HRT and has been open about her journey.  I volunteer at a place where the staff are all women under 30 and am trying to be open (but not overly dire) about mine.
10e5nc5,I talk to my female friends who are my age and they are going through same thing but aren't being as proactive as I am.
10e5nc5,I'm super young so people probably don't expect me to be in this boat ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10e5nc5,[deleted]
10e5nc5,"My wife (F 53) was telling me about some issues her sister (F 51) is going through over the weekend. Mainly heightened anxiety and general dread. 

I prefaced with, ‚ÄúNot to mansplain something you may already be thinking of‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶but have you guys talked about Perimenopause?‚Äù

It took me finding this sub about a year ago to recognize what my wife had been going through for more than a year prior. And to start to talk openly between us about how she‚Äôs feeling and what she‚Äôs going through. 

And, no, she hadn‚Äôt even once discussed her experience with her sister nor even thought to connect the dots of her own anxiety and depression to what her sister was describing. 

I don‚Äôt know if her sister is in peri or not. But it was fascinating to me that these two people who share so many intimate details of their life hadn‚Äôt talked about this nor did it register as something that they might both be facing together."
10e5nc5,"No one would know I was going thru it just by looking at me because I ‚Äúlook too young for menopause‚Äù and I‚Äôm On heavy duty HRT so symptoms are minimal. I tell everyone about it tho because we need to spread awareness so
Women know what is happening to them"
10e5nc5,"There is silence surrounding menopause, on both sides. I make a point of talking about it openly with absolutely ANYONE. I don't care who gets uncomfortable (maybe), because there is a serious lack of awareness that can only be addressed by bringing the subject to light, and this largely includes medical research, advice, assistance and treatments."
10e5nc5,"I work in a predominantly female run field (corporate, not healthcare) that‚Äôs probably 80% female all the way up to executive management. I work at a big company, so there are age cohorts that formed naturally as company grew and wen‚Äôt through hiring cycles. Most of the people in my cohort are 48-35. There‚Äôs the 55-45 crew which I‚Äôm technically part of but don‚Äôt talk to much because I graduated college late and never had kids. They don‚Äôt talk openly about this stuff. Then there‚Äôs the 44-35 crew who are my people and they are pretty open to talking about women‚Äôs health issues. The next cohort is 23-34, and they are not squeamish at all when talking women‚Äôs health issues. 

I‚Äôm the oldest in my work and outside friend group at age 45 with the youngest of the group being 26 (she‚Äôs an old soul), and the rest range age 43-35. I just talk openly about my peri-menopause issues and most of them chime with their own complaints or ask questions because they are starting to notice change. More than half of us have had hysterectomies, ablations or fibroid/polyp surgery so it‚Äôs not like we have anything to hide from each other. What happens more often than not, is one of us complains about something and then another person gets told to come talk to us because because they are having the same problem. 

There seems to be an understanding the privacy is less important regarding women‚Äôs issues. That happens when someone is always having a baby and you end up seeing all the good, bad, and the most devastating parts of womanhood happen to your peers every day. It‚Äôs been interesting working with mostly women my whole life. Sometimes is really sucks because it can feel like high school, and there are obvious age differences in what‚Äôs taboo or not to talk about, but you get a glimpse into what the supportive ‚Äúvillage‚Äù mentality of women can be like.

EDIT: I‚Äôm also going to add that I think how much someone talks about menopause has to do with how bad someone is dealing with symptoms. My mom never talked about it because her period just creeped off silently into the night with no other symptoms (she openly talks to me about it now). My step-mom was very open and vocal because she went through 15 years of pure hell before finally getting approved for hysterectomy at age 60 because she never stopped bleeding. I have one coworker that is *constantly* calling building services to turn down the heat because she gets terrible hot flashes and she has no problem announcing them to everyone in earshot. Everyone knew there was something up with me when it was -24F outside and I was wearing a cami, flip flops and sweating ü§£"
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve decided to be the one that talks about it. Openly. Like it‚Äôs completely normal - because it is. At my gym 3 women then started talking about how they‚Äôre feeling something similar and as a result our coach has started looking at training variations during peri (I mean, she‚Äôs going to go through it if she‚Äôs fortunate!) and it‚Äôs started a very open dialogue with the women AND the men in the gym. 

It‚Äôs not something to be ashamed of, or hide. We should talk about it as it seems even doctors aren‚Äôt."
10e5nc5,"Since I work from home, I don't have to leave my house when I'm falling apart. On the occasions that I do leave my house, I'm feeling pretty okay and looking put-together. If I wasn't, I likely wouldn't be leaving my house. I don't like to go out and about when I don't feel well.

People put on a good face when they are out amongst other people. You can't tell by looking at someone what all is going on behind the scenes.

Some people don't like to talk about personal matters, especially ones that involve bodily functions and stuff. I have someone in my life who I thought was a good friend (and she still might be, I can't tell) and I had to let her know I couldn't meet up with her at an annual event because I had super high anxiety and was feeling lousy from peri. She didn't seem to sympathize too much and I haven't really heard much from her since then. 

I think the very topic of menopause makes a lot of people uncomfortable, even those who are of the age to be going through it. It's unfortunate that there seem to be taboos surrounding something that half of the population will experience in our lifetimes.

It's fantastic that we can talk about it so freely here, but at the end of the day we are all strangers sitting behind a computer or phone screen. It's very different than putting all your business out there for people you know in real life who you have to see on a regular basis."
10e5nc5,"I think there's a lot of denial.  I was told by my doctor I was too young to worry about it.  Combine that with me happily on board with the idea I was still too young for something...

I see a psychiatrist every few months for my ADHD medication.  It's not talk therapy, she requires it to refill my meds but I've known her for years now.  She helped me through a death in the family, anxiety, etc. I consider her to be a lifesaver, she's amazing.  She's about my age. 

We struggled for awhile to treat my insomnia. Then overwhelming fatique even when I was sleeping. 
She never mentioned hormones.  Once I started HRT and had my next appt with her I told her how much better I felt, more energy, better sleep and about the HRT.  

She was really caught off guard.  She was happy for me and admitted most doctors get almost zero training on menopause but I think she was bothered by how missing it being a possible cause of my concerns. 

I don't blame her- it's not her area of expertise. I do blame my gyno. My point being doctors don't even think of hormones or menopause being as impactful on the whole body and mind as they are so regular women are not thinking of it many times. 

It's not a group most of us were eager to join (I wasn't at least).  I tell ALL of my friends about my experience now because I'm so thankful to know what's happening to me. 

Ramble over. I think it's mostly still lack of knowledge combined with it being something related to middle age women because who cares about us/s?  

But yes we should have some secret symbol we can wear as a necklace or something lol"
10e5nc5,"I don't know many people IRL, and all but two are past menopause. My best friend is going through peri, and honestly she's not having a hard time at all, compared to myself at least. I think...maybe...a lot of women might not have it that hard. Either they are okay, or if they have symptoms, they might not recognize what's going on.

As I educated myself about peri, I also told my friend what I was finding out, and she definitely wasn't connecting the dots. I didn't know I was going through peri until this last summer, and I've likely been in it for several years already. I had been struggling with insomnia, pain, anxiety and had NO idea what was going on. It really impacted my quality of life. My friend, by comparison, yea she has some issues but life is mostly the same for her. Probably the biggest change for her is a total loss of libido."
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve met a few ladies that are all around my age. As soon as I have a hot flash, I pull out my portable fan and some ask ‚Äúare you having a hot flash‚Äù I‚Äôm like yes I am. Then everyone goes in silence as if I said something foreign Lol. Meanwhile some of the ladies starts to sweat and they swear it‚Äôs not a hot flash. Lolll I find it amusing how they‚Äôre in denial"
10e5nc5,I totally relate to everything you said.  But irl I bet we all seem like we have our stuff together to people who know us casually.
10e5nc5,"I struggle a lot because of needing to use unpaid leave. Personally,  if I didn't have an amazing support system I'd have been homeless a couple years ago. 

But, without FMLA I'd also be jobless.

The system is a mess.

I have a coworker a couple years older than me going through the the same menopause related issues and also struggling to lower her A1C so chats with her help me feel less crazy."
10e5nc5,You can recognize us in the wild through the careful observation of the arrangement of the neck scarf.
10e5nc5,I make jokes about ‚Äúmental pause‚Äù when out and about interacting with women of similar age. You‚Äôd be surprised at how much solidarity there is once you talk about it openly! :)
10e5nc5,"Very good question. I decided to flaunt my fan like I'm in a L'Oreal commercial, even in December. Any lady apparently over 45 that carries/waves a fan no matter what the temperature is, is my gal. It's a secret code."
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôm heartbroken that Revel - a social network for women of a certain age - just folded. I very much want in person meetups on how to cope with this chapter of my life. Having this sub is essential but I‚Äôm isolated and tired of it, especially since most of my friends are either geographically distant or affinity groups with much younger people. I don‚Äôt know any of the folks who go to raves talking about hot flashes üòÇ"
10e5nc5,I‚Äôm older than a lot of my friends for dumb reasons that would involve a long story so yeah. I feel alone. I do have one friend who is getting it worse though. Do a group chat. People open up.
10e5nc5,"I found my people at Bunco. I'm vocal. I explain why I'm stepping outside in the middle of a game because it's cooler out there. (I have my partner roll for me.) I can say, ""Personal summer,"" hand off the dice, and go. No problem.

I've educated the younger women in the group just through casual conversation. Last month the most common comment was, ""Ten years? Really?"" Others backed me up."
10e5nc5,"The first I heard about menopause, from anyone, was a lady I worked with over 20 years ago. She was the one who talked too much and told business she shouldn‚Äôt be telling. When I began this change, all I could remember was her voice and her talking about the hell she was going through. I didn‚Äôt understand any of it back then but I do now. My mom had a hysterectomy in her 30‚Äôs and was always on hrt. I have never felt more alone as a woman as I did when I began this process‚Ä¶"
10e5nc5,2.09am here.
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve started talking about it quite freely with my close friends. I had a hot flash when camping over Thanksgiving so all of my friends witnessed me frantically tearing off all of my cold weather gear and walking away from the fire in 30 degree weather to cool off lol.

I also have a younger group of friends (27-29) from my last job and I‚Äôve mentioned a few things. I made a point to say that I think it‚Äôs weird that women hide their symptoms. They are amazing supportive ladies and they were curious about it."
10e5nc5,No one talks about it. I was menopausal in my 30‚Äôs so it‚Äôs been especially isolating.
10e5nc5,I‚Äôm really not sure. Most my friends are younger than me so I have no one to ask about this stuff either. Thank goodness for this sub.
10e5nc5,"I agree! I have a few friends who had hysterectomies, so they do sort of understand because they're dealing with abrupt menopause. I have one friend who had one because of endo and now either can't or is afraid to take any HRT. But it's not quite the same (even though it sucks) because they aren't in this up and down.

Honestly, I think a lot of women don't like talking about it because it makes them feel old. Like we're not supposed to talk about it because then people look at us like we're dried up old crones. I am pretty vain, and I still try to look good. So part of me doesn't want to mention it. But when I do, I am also met with just confusion--like I'm not having any of these issues!"
10e5nc5,"I swear, EVERY woman I speak to over age 42 is in the same boat as the rest of us-Some are just better at hiding it or they're on the best combo of HRT available to womankind."
10e5nc5,"I don't suffer a lot of the symptoms that people post here. I can't remember any woman I know in person bringing up menstrual,  perimenopausal or menopausal things they are dealing with mild or severe. I'd say people just talk more freely online."
10e5nc5,"I wonder this on the daily. Even my close friends just pretend and get on with it. I want to scream and yell and complain, but it‚Äôs just not done."
10e5nc5,"Had to share this because it‚Äôs amazing. 

https://www.etsy.com/listing/501345652/"
10e5nc5,Just got here yesterday.  Yes it‚Äôs true.  No one talks about menopause.  I‚Äôm just finally finding my people!
10e5nc5,"At every opportunity, I bring up the fact that I am suffering from hot flashes and menopause. No matter the age or gender of the people I happen to be around... if there is any plausible reason to bring it up, I do. It still surprises me how uncomfortable it makes people, but I don't give a shit (i.e., one of the many benefits of menopause). When I'm lucky, I get an AMEN from a fellow sister. I exist and I see you. I suggest TOWANDA as our safe word. Much love."
10e5nc5,"Like some other commenters, I‚Äôve decided to hell with the norms and I‚Äôm the person who does talk about it with colleagues and acquaintances. Not to rant on about it but I‚Äôll openly say, yeah it‚Äôs not covid weight it‚Äôs perimenopause weight and the hormones are winning the fight. Or I‚Äôll talk about insomnia when others mention similar symptoms. I‚Äôve found at work that as soon as I raise the topic there are many women who are so keen to talk about it - and some men whose partners are going through it too. Let‚Äôs normalise the conversation!"
10e5nc5,"Ok...so NO ONE in my age range is going through menopause or peri-symptoms. Being heaved in medical menopause at 40 & on high dose HRT makes me an absolute joy to be around. None of my clothes fit, I‚Äôm hot and sweaty, moody, bloated, zero libido, and feel like an angry gremlin all the time. 
So I promise you, you are NOT alone, and we are most definitely out there in the wild. Sweating, unbuttoning our pants in the car, and cursing up a storm until we get back to our cave."
10e5nc5,"Every single time I come here I feel validation and so much empathy for all of us.  This is on top of the drowning sadness that is my life now, I always leave sobbing. 
I feel so angry no one warned us about this and then I remember, I wouldn't have believed it if they had"
10e5nc5,"I am a divorce attorney.  I am only in my mid-30s myself, but whether it is because of problems with my birth control or just incredibly early peri menopause, I find myself with many symptoms that exist here (most prominently, vaginal atrophy that is affecting my marriage), which is why I initially began following this sub. 

Now that I‚Äôm exposed to some of the symptoms and experiences, I can look back at several of my clients and see that they were probably peri or menopausal while I was handling their divorces.  Their lives had changed and their husbands had not adjusted.  I think knowing what experiences some women have help me understand what women might be going through, and makes me better suited to help my clients."
10e5nc5,"I agree with so many of the comments. I talk about the hard things, even before menopause. Amazing when I‚Äôm vulnerable some others feel safe enough to be as well.
Anyone of you in the West suburbs of Chicago? Would love a like minded friend!"
10e5nc5,Same as you!!! We are here I promise!!!
10e5nc5,LOL! I love this. Thank you.
10e5nc5,The narration is first rate. I‚Äôm giggling in the doctor‚Äôs office while waiting for them to explain the ongoing menopausal discharge mess that has me walking around in depends ü•¥. I SOOOO NEEDED this laugh! So glad I‚Äôm not alone!
10e5nc5,"I love you. I've only been in this sub really a week, and as frustrated as most people are, the level of creativity here boiling underneath the frustrations is amazing."
10e5nc5,"‚ÄúRequires a level of motivation and pants that are not always available‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

And then the comment just keeps getting funnier."
10e5nc5,This is HILARIOUS!! Thanks for the laugh! üíï
10e5nc5,A+
10e5nc5,LOL.
10e5nc5,üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüòÑ
10e5nc5,"I literally read this in David Attenborough‚Äòs voice, and can‚Äôt read it any other way. A National Geographic mini documentary played in my head as I read to myself. This is absolute gold."
10e5nc5,"Amen. My male therapist is getting an earful, but I think his wife will thank me in a few years lol."
10e5nc5,"It‚Äôs like a game for me now. I will start talking openly about my symptoms  and then women of a certain age will open up. All kinds of experiences, all kinds of women. Oh and my one friend said she breezed through it but thinking back she closed her shop because of her insomnia around that time and not being mean but her skin has turned into paper tissue.

This is one of the last silent spaces in women‚Äôs health. Soon there will be 1 billion post menopausal women. When will we start to be pro active about this? We‚Äôve got the education now, the most infuriating stories are of female doctors who are dismissive.  We need a whole rethink of this if everyone is going to live past 60."
10e5nc5,"I've brought it up with a few friends and it's interesting how the door starts to slowly open but mostly I feel like everyone still tip-toes around it. Thank God for the internet because I recognize so much of what I struggle with. I take HRT and that has been hugely helpful but I still really struggle to be motivated to do much of anything at the end of the workday. I just want a blanket and to decompress with some TV. It seriously feels like a chore to have to go out to dinner, as I must tonight. 

Same with the weekends. My work productivity and motivation steadily declines as the week goes on and then on the weekend I'm just not that interested in anything. I'm moving in the next few months and I'm very excited about that and feel like it may kick start me. I'm not sure how much of this is also due to living amongst some of the  juvenile and gossipy neighbors that I have just had enough of. I really have no energy or interest in some of the nastiness that seemed to come about during the pandemic."
10e5nc5,This was me today at my new job in a room full of women. I did get more than a few who knew the drill. Might have even made a friend or two. We exist.üíû
10e5nc5,"Ha yeah, most of my friends are younger than me so I feel like I‚Äôm helping to pave the way for them. Like your friend‚Äôs older sister telling you about tampons."
10e5nc5,"As someone whose peri started at 37, maybe consider starting a little younger. ü§£  I thought I was getting early onset dementia and panic disorder all at once."
10e5nc5,"I belong to a local private FB menopause group, but it's not very active, and discussion mostly tends toward HRT-related questions. Maybe it's New England reserve - when I've tried to talk about peri/meno with women my age or older, it seems to be mostly a no-go topic."
10e5nc5,I also think that women just don't know that what they are experiencing could be related to menopause or a hormonal imbalance. They are going to all these separate doctors for all their ailments and not seeing the common possible link. We need to keep talking about it out loud to spread awareness.
10e5nc5,"Also, do we need shirts or pins to help identify each other?

10e5nc5,"I think so, too. Or if women say anything at all, it‚Äôs only about hot flashes, which I guess are more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù as menopause transition symptoms bc of the stereotypes?"
10e5nc5,Gurrrrl‚Ä¶ i have both and you speak truth.
10e5nc5,"You're definitely not the only one.  When I was having hot flushes they were constantly waking me up at night as well, the lack of sleep made me feel insane."
10e5nc5,PREACH.
10e5nc5,I gave up on sleeping at 2:30 & just worked for the past 2 hours instead.  Going to try to get some sleep before my 9am teleconf now.  ü´§
10e5nc5,‚ÄúMiddle Raged.‚Äù That is a BRILLIANT play on words. Advertising copywriter approved! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
10e5nc5,I‚Äôve heard that HELL hath no fury like a MiddleRager.
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôm new to this community, but I‚Äôd like to think you have friends here who can listen and give some support.  Just to know you are not alone."
10e5nc5,"I feel every word of this, my sister.  I see you.  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10e5nc5,You are seen and heard. ü§ó
10e5nc5,Right?!?  But they SEEM LIKE they have their shit together!!! That‚Äôs what kills me!
10e5nc5,I LOVE THIS IDEA.
10e5nc5,"Shit, yet ANOTHER symptom i didn‚Äôt know about!"
10e5nc5,Ahhh‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm in Tokyo otherwise I would!
10e5nc5,"D.C., but someone raised the idea of a virtual meet up!"
10e5nc5,TRUTH.
10e5nc5,Same!!
10e5nc5,Starting with women at 35 may be your issue -- talk to women who are closer to 45-55. Most women at 35 have not even experienced peri yet.
10e5nc5,"Oh my GAWDUHHHHH - this is totally what happens to me.  The best thing is that my MOM says she just breezed right through it (and childbirth, raising kids, pretty much everything), which of course just gaslights the heck outta me."
10e5nc5,"Same, girl"
10e5nc5,"I mean, to be honest, men don't have it so great either. They do have their own issues. My husband had low T starting in his 30s and was on clomid and then made the switch to T in his 40s. He gives himself a giant shot once a week. Also, he's balding and he tried the oral minoxidil and it made him super depressed and he had to stop. He's not very proactive about his issues. I had to make him go to the doctor. On the other hand, I put botox in my face to stay looking ""fresh,"" and it's never even occurred to him to do that. He's never felt the pressure to look young."
10e5nc5,"If she's 51 years old I'm sure she's in peri. It would be weird for her \*not\* to be in peri at that age, you know? And the crazy level of anxiety is a dead giveaway for this."
10e5nc5,"Honestly, I had a stillbirth when I was younger, and I felt COMPLETELY alone. It was like you just weren't supposed to talk about it. It made it all 1000 times worse. And then later I found out numerous people I knew had experienced late miscarriages, abortions because of birth defects, etc....

I would never NOT talk about it. I was so angry--and part of that anger was that I was supposed to pretend like it hadn't happened."
10e5nc5,"It‚Äôs getting harder for me to follow through on those occasions when I‚Äôm expected at a daytime event of any kind. 

If I do the hard work of pulling myself together with hair, a little makeup & jewelry, business casual attire that doesn‚Äôt hate my body‚Äî and then actually leave the house and attend said event ‚Äî afterward, I‚Äôm good for for nothing, for the rest of the day. 

My energy tank drops to nothing."
10e5nc5,I think it‚Äôs really valuable to know that medical professionals don‚Äôt get a lot of training in this! I appreciate your rambling! üëÅÔ∏è
10e5nc5,That‚Äôs just crazy talk!üòÇ
10e5nc5,I love a good infinity myself.
10e5nc5,"Feeling alone is yet another unexpected side effect, isn‚Äôt it.  Good thing we have each other!!!!"
10e5nc5,No mom? Sister? Older cousin? Aunt? Etc?
10e5nc5,"EVERY woman over 42? I dunno. I didn't really notice anything at all until 49. Had a couple of hot flashes. Went on HRT. Nothing since, really.

Edit: I'm STILL 49 (will be 50 this year), so it may be early days for me and there could be a lot more hell ahead, but so far this doesn't seem bad. YET."
10e5nc5,BWAAAHAHAHA!!!
10e5nc5,"First, I‚Äôm so sorry for your drowning sadness, but i gotta say, you have a gift with words.  That is a very apt way to say it and completely describes how i feel most of the time.  ‚òπÔ∏è

Second, YES WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THIS SHIT!!!  You are so right.   That is one reason why I am reluctant to talk about it to other women who seem to have their shit together! I feel like when I was in my 30s, & i heard older women talk about things like this, my pitiful stupid-ass brain thought, ‚Äúwhat a whiner!!!  For god‚Äôs sake, it can‚Äôt be that bad!‚Äù  What a rube i was.  

youth really is wasted on the young!"
10e5nc5,You are an exceptionally insightful 30-something!
10e5nc5,"Wish i was, my sister.  ‚òπÔ∏è"
10e5nc5,"Ah yes, the discharge. Apparently my vagina has had a nasty, snotty cold for months now."
10e5nc5,"Ugh, I just started this.  Let us know what the doc says."
10e5nc5,"That just made me lol after a very, very long day"
10e5nc5,"AMEN, SISTER. ‚úäüèΩ"
10e5nc5,"Seriously, it is depressing but validating to read your comment. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to get through the next 20 years of working without simplifying my life, or changing my lifestyle or serious therapy and meds or something, anything. Why tf did nobody tell me I would stop running around like an energiser bunny at this age? I was not expecting this and have so much sympathy for my Mom now. I don‚Äôt know how female political leaders or movie stars keep it up. I feel like I‚Äôll never go back to my younger self. Moved away from awful neighbour myself last year. His last words to me were I know where you‚Äôre moving to, and I just lost it at him."
10e5nc5,I keep reading all the comments on this post and thinking ‚Äúme too! Me too!‚Äùü•π
10e5nc5,"Yeah, I'm 39 now and after having figured out what's happening to me and I tell people (even my family), they're like ""No, that can't be, you're too young.""

Thank you very much, makes me feel great aahhh!"
10e5nc5,"The fear of dementia is real. I can't count the number of times I've seen it mentioned and OH BOY the number of times I've thought ""maybe this is early onset dementia"" 

Lol or the online searches. I've even done a few self tests. It doesn't help I also have adhd and many of the early signs of dementia are also adhd symptoms."
10e5nc5,"I'm old-er, early 60's. One of my coworkers is 39, showing all the classic signs and in deep denial because she is too young, I have told her to come here, but she is too deep in her denial to venture in."
10e5nc5,Oh my goodness... I'm 37 and started be like that.
10e5nc5,I‚Äôm in New England and can confirm!  No one talks about it.  I joined a UK based perimenopause group a few years ago and it‚Äôs like another world!
10e5nc5,Agreed!!!!  Suffering in Silence because heaven forbid we act unlady like.  We need to speak up and demand better Healthcare for women.  I've never been so blown off in my life. The only option is they want to put me on birth control.
10e5nc5,Great shirt - looking forward to buying one whenever I get a new job
10e5nc5,I love how the chick wearing the shirt looks like she‚Äôs 16 üôÑ
10e5nc5,"I personally like something like this. 

https://www.etsy.com/listing/1058611135/"
10e5nc5,"Op mentioned everything, everywhere all at once so perhaps we could wear a googlie eye on our lapel? lol I'm down!"
10e5nc5,Goddamit. You just made me spend money.
10e5nc5,I love that shirt!!!!
10e5nc5,LOVE THIS SHIRT.
10e5nc5,I agree. I was at a department meeting fanning myself and two female colleagues came up to me to talk about hot flashes. We shared ideas and laughed together- but the conversation did not extend beyond hot flashes!
10e5nc5,"I haven't had any hot flashes YET. I say yet since they're probably coming for me. But I always thought that was like the HALLMARK of perimenopause, and so far I haven't had that particular symptom."
10e5nc5,Ikr?üíó
10e5nc5,"I‚Äôve embraced the sporadic sleep schedule, folding laundry at 3 am is what it is. üòÇ"
10e5nc5,When I started Wellbutrin I started sleeping through the night. Maybe it‚Äôs Wellbutrin that makes the difference?
10e5nc5,"Raging against inequities of the world. Since most of us are Gen X, we are used to being ignored - no more."
10e5nc5,‚ù§Ô∏è thank you
10e5nc5,"Well they probably think the same about me‚Ä¶I look fine, but I feel like Quasimodo üòÇ"
10e5nc5,"What, growing a second head? LMFAO!!!! That might actually be a GOOD symptom"
10e5nc5,At 35 I was just starting peri but had no clue that‚Äôs what was happening.
10e5nc5,"I expanded the age group because everyone else denied it. I started peri in my 30‚Äôs too. 

I was hoping younger women wouldn‚Äôt be so put off discussing it. But there‚Äôs just a lack of knowledge at that age, which is what I had at that age too. I had no idea what was happening to me when it started and my doctors gaslit me the entire time."
10e5nc5,And we‚Äôre made to think we‚Äôre being so dramatic about it all for saying anything. Which makes me want to BE dramatic!!
10e5nc5,"Same, I had a miscarriage long ago and the sadness was compounded by loneliness. 

Society has for so long expected women to keep quiet about all the most painful and difficult parts of being female. But when you tell the truth about your life, everyone else feels less alone. It‚Äôs important.

Tell your stories, everyone."
10e5nc5,"I can totally relate. I'm an introvert as it is and now my social battery drains even quicker. And in my case I am too anxious to drive all the way across town so I rarely go anywhere off my beaten path, which is okay I guess because I have anything I need within about a 3 mile radius of my house. 

I feel way less anxious when I'm taking my progesterone pills but my doctor has me cycling them so I'm on them for 12 days and then off them for 13 days. I feel lousy when I'm off of them! I am going to ask my doctor at my next visit if I can stop the cycling and go on the lower dose every day plan."
10e5nc5,"Heck, i need the next day to recover from that too!!!"
10e5nc5,"Yes, as do I. Doubled up it pretty much diverts attention away from my newly acquired old lady neck."
10e5nc5,Mom. But that generation doesn‚Äôt talk about it much. I think her symptoms were mild as mine have been so far.
10e5nc5,"I have a (living) mom and two older sisters. There is definitely some sort of generation gap thing going, because when I started perimenopause (I'm 51 and postmenopausal--I HOPE--now), I turned to all of them for advice and got crickets. 

My sisters are both almost a decade older than me (I was an unplanned surprise baby). When I asked about menopause, they kind of shrugged and said nothing. My mother gave me a magazine article...at least she tried.

I had to connect the dots in my head and realize that my oldest sister's insomnia (accompanied by extreme dieting and brutal workouts), my middle sister's sudden weight gain, and that long-ago memory of my mother being depressed and antisocial (My dad: ""leave her alone and don't bother her"") were all menopause related."
10e5nc5,"WHAT IS THIS SHIT? the discharge thing is disgusting. The last time it was this much of a mess, I was pregnant."
10e5nc5,"Oh, he sounds like a jerk! Glad you got to move away from him! And this is exactly why I wrote the original post. I also don‚Äôt know how leaders or movie stars cope, or anyone else at work for that matter!!!  But I feel like I‚Äôm the only one having a nervous breakdown on the regular!"
10e5nc5,"Dementia Specialist here: if y'all need to talk about why you forget the reason you walked in the kitchen, it's perfectly normal. Google ""doorway effect."" As for lost words, be sure you're taking a daily multivitamin, B-complex, Magnesium glycinate, and a D3+K supplement."
10e5nc5,"shoot, I replied to the wrong comment. Please look for my comment in the thread. Your brain is OK, forgetting why you walked in the kitchen is normal and even happens to young people."
10e5nc5,"Come to us of her own volition, the young padawan must.  Right you will be proven."
10e5nc5,"I agree with all of you, but find it really hard to put into practice IRL. I hate feeling like I‚Äôm the only one going through it because no one else wants to talk about it. Makes me feel like a whiner, which obviously goes against every Gen X bone in my body."
10e5nc5,You never know who‚Äôs had a hysterectomy though.
10e5nc5,"yea looking young for one's age is one thing, but that is ridiculous."
10e5nc5,Dammit!  Love this one too!
10e5nc5,THIS IS THE ANSWER. üßøüëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
10e5nc5,I know!  Me too!  I may just have to buy it for myself.
10e5nc5,"I was thinking of you all when I got up at 3 am. I didn't want to get online and wake myself up more, but you were all on my mind and I had a little chuckle to myself knowing I wasn't alone. Thanks."
10e5nc5,"yes but that's not the norm for most women, which I think is the above commenters point about talking to woman at 35 might not get a lot of people experiencing symptoms. That being said, having that talk is still good. I know I wish someone had told me and I feel like I'm fighting the urge to grab every younger woman on the street, shake them and say ""ITS COMING FOR YOU! YOU CAN'T STOP IT! PREPARE AND PLAN!"""
10e5nc5,"Me neither! But I knew I was having symptoms and what they were. If someone came up to me and said ‚Äòhey, does your vag do this?‚Äô I would have been able to say ‚Äòhell yeah it does! Umm, why??‚Äô Lol 

I recognized my body was doing something that was different. I just didn‚Äôt know all these changes had one cause and that it had a name."
10e5nc5,"Oh, I agree, the conversations need to start EARLY. Obviously WAY before it happens. But 35 is still generally young to even start peri, so it might be harder to find people who are already experiencing SYMPTOMS, as opposed to those 45 and older. At 35, nothing at all was happening to me. I'm 49 now and I had what FELT like my first couple of hot flashes last year. Immediately got on HRT and nothing since then, luckily, although I'm on the lookout for whatever may come!"
10e5nc5,"I encourage everyone to talk about what ever they need to because society needs to normalize what women go through. I‚Äôve never been pregnant but I am always open to talking about miscarriage, still birth, bloody show and vagina hernias. Just because I didn‚Äôt do it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not empathetic and willing to offer support. Pregnancy and childbirth is as serious, dangerous and unpredictable as it is amazing and wonderful. Modern society has forgotten this because we have sterile hospitals and a culture of shaming women for doing what we do naturally. 

And men (cis, straight, gay, bi trans and everything else in between) need to pony up and join the conversation. They need to learn how to discuss and accept the reality of good, the bad and the bloody parts of being a woman. 

Society also needs to normalize women aging. We aren‚Äôt here just to look good and have babies and at some point we‚Äôve earned the right to move on from that part of our lives and start living for ourselves. Fuck anyone who has a problem with my gray hair, wrinkles, menopause talk and less perky boobs. I‚Äôm not waisting my energy trying to pretend I‚Äôm not aging so other people don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable about it. üñïüèªto anyone who can‚Äôt handle women aging. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Side note- I am home recovering from a bisalp and ablation and obviously starting to feel better ü§£"
10e5nc5,Weird how all our moms had no meno symptoms at all whatsoever‚Ä¶ üòí
10e5nc5,"My oldest sister always had issues with dieting and body dysmorphia, but I am recalling now that in her late 40s she really doubled down. She would get up at 4 am and spend hours at the gym before going to work. Regularly run 12 miles on the weekends or spend 2 hours straight on the Gauntlet. She remained very skinny as a result, but I'm wondering now if she started to notice sudden weight gain, as my middle sister displayed, and panicked. I'm going through the same thing and I'm slipping into some extreme and unhealthy habits trying to get back to my ""age 41"" weight. We as women really need to be more open about all this stuff. It's ridiculous."
10e5nc5,I'm moving and will get to be free of one of the most toxic people I've ever known in my life. I'm optimistic that just getting that toxicity out of my daily environment is going to lift a lot of the sort of avoidance feeling that I've had of late.
10e5nc5,My favourite one is people who have babies now. I have a puppy and have constant guilt about not being a good dog parent and anxiety about the cost of medical emergencies.
10e5nc5,Thank you for this!
10e5nc5,"Yeah just how many times I do it in a day now, cripes."
10e5nc5,"Lol, yes. True this is."
10e5nc5,"I hear you! I just stopped caring what people thought about it. I talk about it openly like I would any other ailment to normalize it. I do love having this community though, it makes me feel less crazy!"
10e5nc5,True that and I went into menopause after cancer treatment. Not a gray hair yet in sight.
10e5nc5,"Heck, thank YOU!!!"
10e5nc5,"I want billboard signs all over place. And flyers. Radio announcements. Themed parties where we declare someone ‚Äòstarted‚Äô it. I want a ring that signifies I‚Äôm in that stage of life. 

I want employers to have to give PTO for days when we have too many symptoms or couldn‚Äôt sleep, I want my own classification of discount when I shop, I want there to be a children‚Äôs book about it so we can start educating people that early, and I want women to TALK about this with each other at all ages. I also want to shake people to warn them lol 

Edit: added"
10e5nc5,"You‚Äôre so lucky HRT worked for you. It wasn‚Äôt enough for me and I went back on BC and that still wasn‚Äôt enough to even it all out. It‚Äôs been a terrible transition for over 6 years 

And every ‚Äòolder‚Äô women says they had no symptoms or they have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. But I find that hard to believe when I‚Äôve spoke to so many women. Thats statistically not possible. It‚Äôs more probable it‚Äôs just a taboo topic."
10e5nc5,What they need to do is teach all about menopause when they start teaching kids about puberty.
10e5nc5,"I stopped coloring my hair 10 months ago. Said, fuck it. I've been fighting the grays since I was 18. Genes won üòÅ. My hubby calls me his silver fox.I tell anyone that'll listen, how shitty menopause is. I'm going to be 52 this month. I'm the youngest of 6. My 3 sisters, 2 sister-in-laws and myself are all going through menopause ü§£ü§£ü§£. That there isn't a trail of bodies everywhere is a miracle. My hubby is starting to get with the program. My biggest upset is my dead libido. A few times I got excited because my libido let me know, hey I'm still here, however all 3 of my vibrators are broken üò≠. I think you hit it on the head though; fuck anybody who's uncomfortable with my aging. I'm glad your recovery is going well. I liked your Ted Talk.."
10e5nc5,"(I don't mean the increase is not normal, I mean the amount of times has gone up, almost certainly perimenopause, and it is at times extremely frustrating.)"
10e5nc5,"I don't think menopause and gray hair are linked. It's more of a genetic thing. I got my first grays at 27, years before peri was even a twinkle in my eye. ;)"
10e5nc5,"Same. There are menopausal folks of all ages and causes here. That said, I take their point. Now every time I have a hot flash in public (about hourly unfortunately, I can't do HRT) I have a mantra that I always say when people notice I'm sweating: ""Go tell your mother thank you and you love her."" I get a lot of shocked reactions since I'm young(ish) and dealing with this crap, but I always try to use it as a moment to gently remind people that the vast majority of women going through it are just quietly soldiering on and being ignored (or worse) when they do speak up. It's certainly given me a whole new appreciation and outlook on aging and ageism."
10e5nc5,I think we have our Manifesto.  ‚úäüèΩ
10e5nc5,"I'm not gonna lie, I've been wondering what kind of guerrilla advertising campaign I could do and what would it have to say or show to catch someone's attention.  Then I remember the young ones that need it most don't even look up from their phones when they walk around and got sad. I thought I had a problem with being too online; I was just a trend setter. 

Who am I kidding, I am an old and what I really got sad about is that I don't think I could make a tiktok campaign to catch their attention. CLICK FOR PART TWO."
10e5nc5,"Well. So far! I'm not even quite 50 yet. There could be a ton of fun ahead! :-/ But my older female family members seem to have had a pretty easy time of it -- or so they say! I tend to believe them, though. One aunt in her 60s says hot flashes are still an occasional issue, but she's also avoided HRT."
10e5nc5,Just - thank you!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
10e5nc5,"I will just add that, even though it's dated, that AITF episode is still freaking hilarious today. And they talk about HRT! Edith gets her ""hormone prescription."" The episode originally aired in the early 1970s, long before the demonization of HRT about three decades later."
10e5nc5,"Yes, although, honestly, I think maybe it should come in real detail a bit later. Because girls who are, say, 8 or 9 years old and just really learning about the changes puberty will bring cannot even begin to picture being that ""old"" and dealing with meno. It's out of the realm of their ability to fathom. So the information may go in one ear and out the other -- especially if they haven't even started to menstruate yet and don't even know what THAT'S actually like (but are more interested in it because they know it's coming SOON, rather than in, say, 40 years). It might just be falling on deaf ears.

But the convo should be a MAJOR one by the time a woman is in her 20s.

I remember being little, maybe 8 or so, and watching the menopause episode of All in the Family on reruns. This is the one in which Edith goes through ""the change."" I understood on the most basic level what menopause was, but I didn't even imagine it could truly apply to me. Or it seemed so distant that it was just not in my wheelhouse. The idea of being as old as Edith was unthinkable, haha. And I didn't begin to menstruate until I was almost 13.

I do recall that the episode (called ""Edith's Problem"") gave me the idea that menopause was this thing that kind of hit really suddenly and was done in about a week after you ""changed."" Hahahahah! And my family was very open about sexuality and all it involves, too! But TV can be more influential than your own family! ;)"
10e5nc5,"I fought the good fight from age 16 but around 35 the color change really accelerated and I gave up at 41. It‚Äôs been 4 years since I stopped coloring and I don‚Äôt regret one bit.

My husband is pretty great. He‚Äôs been dealing with prostate issues for a couple years so I feel like were in the trench together.

I‚Äôm the first sister to start menopause but the other three are ages 30-39 so they‚Äôll be here soon enough. I was however extremely surprised by my brother when I told him I was having surgery. He knew exactly what I was having done without me explaining it and was super chill talking to me about it (his wife is 42 and right on my heels). I was like ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù and also ‚ÄúThis is how comfortable EVERY man should be talking about this.‚Äù I was so proud of him. 

I‚Äôm hoping for a little more libido now that I don‚Äôt have to worry about pregnancy or bleeding out but I‚Äôm not setting my expectations too high ü§£"
10e5nc5,I started greying at 16. Totally grey by 21. My mother too. My daughter is a little later at 25.
10e5nc5,"That's true for me, as people in my family start going gray in our late 30's or early 40's. My brother is 3 years younger than me, and has more gray hair than I do."
10e5nc5,"This may be my cue to have a glass of wine and calm down lol

But I had to give that up because I kept gaining weigh around my stomach üò§"
10e5nc5,"I do kind of love we're all going to be mostly gen-x and kind of like ""This is bullshit. Fuck the system, lets tear it down"" even with peri/menopause 

If only we weren't so tired"
10e5nc5,Thank you too!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
10e5nc5,It only takes one of us who‚Äôs mad.  üòú
10e5nc5,"Lol the problem is I‚Äôm pissed but I‚Äôm so tired. Rage used to be jet fuel, now it‚Äôs diesel for that old rusty vs bus that‚Äôs been sitting in the driveway for the last two decades, waiting as promises to fix it up fade just like its sun-bleached roof."

And if we collectively lost our shit due to hormones and our cycles, SO are so fucked. Our kids drive us nuts but we birthed then so we're protective of them when we don't want to put them somewhere far away from us."
10uamb2,"I'm going to be really honest with you. When women are still having our hormone cycles, the hormones themselves encourage feelings of bonding and a ton of willingness to go out of my way to pour myself into the people I was bonding with. I don't think I ever realized that until my hormone levels dropped in my late 40's. 

You know the stereotypes of women where when we're ovulating we're horny, right before our period everything's annoying to us, etc. I don't really buy into that because it makes it sound like we're not in touch with reality when hormones are involved, when actually it's more like hormones are a sort of instagram filter. They don't change what's in front of us at all, but they can change how soft or sharp the edges are, they can change whether we're willing to put up with those things or not. Men have hormone filters too - like if you've ever spent time with a woman who was so sexy that you were willing to overlook that she was annoying or you had nothing in common with her because lust made your more willing to put up with those negatives?

Well, same with us but the time scale is a lot longer - during our reproductive years the hormone cycles can sometimes make us feel like it's worthwhile to put up with a lot of things that are objectively not good for us. And when those hormones diminish, the instagram filter is off and we're looking at the actual un-edited world around us for the first time. 

I also left the man I was with when this change happened. I started to realize that he wasn't pulling his weight in the relationship, wasn't trying, that for so long the 'status quo' was me doing so much more than 50%, accepting less than I needed. He was so used to me doing everything that me asking him to step up to the 50% level felt unfair to him. As they say, when you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression. To my man, being asked to do 50% of the emotional labor in the relationship felt like he was being attacked, and he was defensive. After so many years of the status quo, why would I 'suddenly' expect him to be a true partner? 

And the reason was that when the hormones diminished we were just two people who had to be actually compatible as equals without any softening filter. I couldn't be the only good listener. I couldn't be the only one solving problems and meeting needs, reaching out, penetrating emotional barriers to fix things, wading patiently through his negative reactions. That's what a mother does, not a partner. I wanted a real partner. 

I don't know what your marriage with your wife looks like, what kind of man you are, what kind of relationship and needs you both have. But I can tell you that when hormones diminish, a lot of free passes you've gotten used to might expire. You may have to renegotiate your relationship to one that meets both of your needs - and she might not be able to get her real needs met with you. Your 'back to normal' might be so much unrequited labor for her that it's completely off the table. 

The one thing I wish my ex partner had done in that moment, when he realized he was losing the relationship with me, was to be open to having those conversations about me - without focusing on himself for once. I know relationships are built between two people, but menopause is about one person. Your wife. And for this particular time, you can maybe - depending on her willingness to participate - open a door to a place where *her* needs are centered, her feelings, her thoughts, her dreams, her comfort and her fears can be explored by both of you in a very safe, non judgmental, non defensive place. 

And that's not one conversation, either. It's not 'putting up with listening' or 'letting her talk' - it's being someone who loves her enough to be open to hearing some perhaps hard truths, and open to renegotiating a relationship in which you might have to let go of a lot of the things you've taken for granted, and might have to take on responsibilities you've been letting her carry for years. 

And the reality is that with the filters off, maybe the marriage just isn't what she wants. But I know I would have been grateful if my ex had been willing to listen and see me as I am - to really see me as a human being and not a mother-figure whose biological nature compelled me to take on all of the roles in the relationship he didn't want. 

Not sure if any of that helps."
10uamb2,"I‚Äôve been in menopause for several years. What I‚Äôve noticed is that people know so little about it. I‚Äôve never had a hot flash, but my libido drastically changed, depression, weight gain and so on. This is my new normal. Women change. So maybe instead of wanting your wife to be like she was before, maybe be supportive of who she is now. It‚Äôs a very difficult time in a woman‚Äôs life."
10uamb2,"I think femmerockstar‚Äôs response is exactly right. Just a couple thing a to add it her response. You should know that women have no idea this is coming. We don‚Äôt know we are wearing rose colored glasses are whole life much less that we will loose them in menopause. We don‚Äôt set up our lives with relationships that will be unsustainable once we reach this milestone. With that I found it to be quite distressing. I am a natural care giver and when my rose colored glasses were removed I was very confused and felt like I lost part of me. I have always been a person that has not had to deal with fluctuating emotions (super lucky I know) so feeling irritable all the time was actually incredibly scary for me. Luckily my other symptoms (hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats) were so bad I started HRT. What I did not know was with HRT (estrogen patches specifically) I was given back my rose colored glasses. With that peace was restored to my universe. I would be very careful broaching this subject but having some supportive conversations as suggested above may be able to flush out if she would be open to finding them again. She may have no idea how to find her old self again and she may desperately want to.  Or she may not, that is her choice. I just wanted to throw that out there."
10uamb2,"I have a hard time with questions like this when it is a man and it revolves around sex (but then says, it isn't about sex).  You are prefacing ""loving wife back to normal"" with the fact that she doesn't want to have sex.  It sounds like you aren't listening to her when you are going through the pros and cons of staying together.  There is way more here than menopause and your back issues.  People deal with both all the time.  If you actually do want a good relationship, then you need to get couple's counseling to help both of you decide if the relationship is meeting both of your expectations for how you want to navigate the world: as a couple, or alone.  Both are valid."
10uamb2,"You need to ask her.   And maybe go to counseling, either on  your own as a couple.  


There‚Äôs no ‚Äúin and out of menopause ‚Äú.    She‚Äôs been in perimenopause.   Menopause happens once they have had no period for a full year.   And this is about a lot more than hot flashes.  It‚Äôs a seriously volatile time hormonally and it‚Äôs extremely difficult emotionally and physically and mentally.   

Many women reach the end of their rope in regards to caretaking everyone in their lives.  Ask yourself if you‚Äôve been reciprocating and giving her care and support.  If not then start.  But talk to her. And probably also a therapist."
10uamb2,"To whatever is on her list of ""cons"" you should pay very close, open-hearted, open-minded attention."
10uamb2,"Ask yourself, am i really worthy of my wife's attention? When was the last time i did laundry, took her out on an amazing date etc 

have you cooked lately?  Dude, if not, you're the problem, and menopause helps her see it"
10uamb2,Maybe she wants you back to normal also
10uamb2,"Hi there! I'm in perimenopause but also happen to teach psychology, so bonus of two perspectives! lol

So number one, your loving wife will never be back to normal. Just like **you** also won't ever be back to normal. Most folks think of ""normal"" as ""how I felt when I was 18"". Look, I'm about to have my back fused and found out I also had precancerous polyps in my colon. And I'm only 43. *Aging sucks*. 

What we have to do, as people who love our spouses with all our hearts (as you clearly seem to) is grow and change with each other ... which is HARD. 

I HIGHLY recommend the book **8 Dates by John Gottman**. Get two copies, one for each of you (because there are parts where you need to write in it). The premise of the book is that you have a ""date"" with each other where you talk about one chapter in the book together. And you do it for 8 different chapters/topics. Don't try to do it all at once. I think my husband and I took like 4 months to get through all of it.

The other book I recommend for each of you is **Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson**. The book teaches readers how to have emotionally connected conversations. I think this style of conversation would pair really well with your wife's pros/cons list. 

Full transparency: I'm recommending these books as a psychologist and also because they helped save my own marriage when it was on the rocks 4 years ago. And both books completely transformed our relationship."
10uamb2,I have one question: how loving would you be if you'd have insomnia and slept about 3-4 hours a night? Many menopausal women have bad insomnia. Just a thought.
10uamb2,"Thank you everyone for all this great advice. Fantastic that there is a community like this for support and advice. 

We have had chat and understand each other a lot better. We are doing more stuff together and compliment each other. She has a doctor's appointment coming up and is going to talk to her about the HRT. 

Neither one of us want to loose each other. We have always been that couple you see kissing in the store."
10uamb2,Not sure this is menopause related.  But couples therapy might help.  Your question is kindly written and clearly you care.
10uamb2,"I think that you‚Äôre here, asking for honest help. I find this thing I‚Äôm going through is hard enough for ME to deal with. It takes some true dedication and feelings to contend with something so incurable/helpless. 
My best advice (and I may be wrong) would be communication. For every good relationship, I believe it takes two people who want to look over their shoulder and see that ONE person. We may start out strong with no effort, but as we evolve and things change, we need to come together (deliberately) for each new milestone, discuss the new circumstances, and decide if each of us is willing to CHOOSE to be together through the change. 
Sometimes I get irritated by my SO, and I have a discussion with myself. ‚ÄúThat idiosyncrasy makes me crazy. Is he really worth _____?‚Äù I‚Äôm consciously making myself aware that no one person will fit the bill exactly, but this one guy has SO MANY of the qualities i adore (and surely, I can change what I don‚Äôt admireüòù).
Also, sincerely have the discussion about your own condition(s) that make sexy time less important. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a break and work on getting ourselves healthy. Let‚Äôs just enjoy the scenery for a bit.‚Äù Although I do think that sometimes taking a break from intimacy can lead to complacency and separate beds- so I‚Äôm not sure how to balance the extremes. 
But don‚Äôt feel bad about saying you want her back to normal. I want -so badly-to be normal. And I want my partner to be honest about that."
10uamb2,"I'd encourage anyone to not make ANY impulsive major life decisions or burn any bridges while in the throes of menopausal hormonal upheaval.  Relationships, job, sell your house, move to an island, divorce your teens, tell your MIL off, etc.  It's a tempestuous time full of emotional intensity.  It's tempting and real changes may certainly be necessary and warranted in your life but they can be done thoughtfully and perhaps with a little more care and clarity when things are less crazy.  

I'd suggest getting your mood stabilized first if you feel you want to just rip your current life apart because it no longer seems tolerable.  Whether it's taking various hormones or taking advantage of other medications or alternative treatments or activities that bring you more joy, make yourself the priority right now.  Get what you need in place first before tackling all those momentous decisions.  The facts of your life won't change, and the insights you gained when the rose glasses came off won't disappear.  They'll all still be there.  But you may make better decisions for yourself when you aren't sleep deprived or full of sweat, anxiety and rage or even cognitively challenged.  

OP, if you want to stay married, tell your wife you love her and you want to support her in any way she needs right now to feel better.  Tell her you are also willing to make the specific changes she needs to see you make for the relationship to go forward (if you mean that).  And tell her to take her time figuring out what that is.  Once I got on HRT, I pretty much gave my husband my list about what needed to change in our relationship going forward and I honestly didn't care at the time if he decided to step up or step out.  I just knew I wasn't going back to the status quo that had served him so well before at my expense.  I deserved better. 

He decided to step up.  The kids are grown now, the grandkids are driving them crazy (haha!) and we are retired and celebrating our 40th anniversary this year.  It hasn't all been hearts and flowers, but I'm glad he's still with me on this ride.  We are good companions.  It was a conscious decision back in menopausal times to make sure the relationship changed for the better to support us both more equitably that got us here.  We'll see how the next 40 goes."
10uamb2,"I'm 47, my husband is 41, I'm on the Grey/Ace scale so I've never been super physically intimate. I didn't really notice much of a libido dip, but the anxiety has made intimacy difficult.  
I totally agree with t@Femmerockstar's response and can only add, just love your wife and be there for her. This isn't about you; it's about her and what she's going thru. Trust me, even as an Ace person, there is NOTHING sexier than a partner who is there for you when life is hard. We will remember you just vibing and being a support to us.  
Menopause will pass and she will come out on the other side, thankful for a supportive partner."
10uamb2,Why is she thinking of leaving? Menopause doesn‚Äôt mean divorce. I‚Äôm confused by the question.
10uamb2,HRT for u Both. It's a Life Saver. And it gives u back a sex life
10uamb2,I‚Äôve been joking that menopause causes you to lose all your caring hormonesüòÇ
10uamb2,Organic coconut oil is amazing. The fact you care in this way and enough to reach out for help is also amazing!

10uamb2,"Wow. Well said, madam. Well said."
10uamb2,Copying/pasting for my partner. This brought me to tears and also gave me goosebumps. Thank you
10uamb2,This is such a great way to express it. I‚Äôve saved this post.
10uamb2,This really needs to be pinned to the very top-this is everything
10uamb2,"Yes! Life is full of opportunities for growth, and this is a big one. My husband's willingness to adjust and show empathy and validation has been confirmation that I have a true partner in life."
10uamb2,I need to share this with my partner - thank you for putting this down so thoughtfulLY
10uamb2,So good that I just did a Google translate to send it to my sister who needs that right now !!!
10uamb2,"This ABSOLUTELY is the best thing I've ever read. Thank you so much for this. I'm personally post menopause, and single for nearly 10 years, but you hit the nail right on the head!"

10uamb2,Bravo üëè
10uamb2,Great post. Thank you for putting this out there. Hopefully it helps a partner see themselves in a mirror!
10uamb2,I love how well you‚Äôve described so much of what I feel. Is there literature regarding this? I want to know the science.
10uamb2,Wow enlightened AND enlightening! Bravo bravo bravo a complete masterpiece. Thank you for this honesty!
10uamb2,"This is the single best explanation of life as a woman that I have ever read.  Damn, well done!"
10uamb2,You have explained this so much better than I ever could. This helps me process so many confusing (and irritating) experiences I‚Äôve been having lately due to your clarity. I read this two days ago and your words have been rattling around in my head so I had to come back and reread. Thank you.
10uamb2,"And now I know why I have zero desire for a mate. After having ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù sometimes anyone, my whole life. Since I have entered menopause I have zero interest.

10uamb2,Thank you. I may not get my wife back to who she was but I will still love her for who she is.
10uamb2,"Did anyone ever tell you about HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) We don't have to settle for the awful changes that happen in menopause !!!!

These changes DON'T have to be your new normal !!"
10uamb2,"I appreciate femme‚Äôs response and also yours.

I want to add to yours because I relate to much of what you say.

I used to think I was a ‚Äúcaregiver‚Äù, but what I learned in therapy of *myself* was that I actually was just a ‚Äòdressed-up‚Äô people pleaser. I was meeting a societal expectation of my behavior that *looks like* being a ‚Äònatural born caregiver‚Äô. It was a wild ride to realize that I‚Äôm not *really*‚Ä¶ in fact, I can remember thinking I would never want kids or marriage for YEARS, but I fell in love and fell into the ‚Äúwife‚Äù and ‚Äúcaregiver‚Äù roles that was fulfilled/followed by many women (NOT to their fault either) who came before me‚Äî which was set by a societal structure dictated‚Ä¶ *not by women*‚Ä¶ to put it gently. Think about it: ‚Äúfirst comes love, then comes marriage‚Äù is a freaking nursery rhyme! 

And how many times have many of us expressed here that we shed the people pleasing (societal caregiving expectations set for us, that require we put our own wishes aside much of the time) around this time in our life, and finally learn(ed) to stop ignoring our own needs?!

I see MANY women right now who aren‚Äôt even close to perimenopause going through a realization that we are very much coerced, some of us anyway, into being a certain way. A ‚Äúthis is how it is‚Äù mindset used to permeate the lives of women (my own mother said when she wanted to go to work, she felt like she only had three realistic choices available: nurse, secretary, or teacher) and even though we have been slowly shedding that for decades, there‚Äôs a quickening of it now that I have been witnessing among younger women‚Äî and at least online, it seems to be affecting some of us older women now too, who see such strength in younger ones who are living for THEM, to find what we want too and shed the strict ‚Äúfor others‚Äù/caregiving roles that we are messaged we must fulfill.

I‚Äôm so glad you feel you‚Äôre getting parts of yourself back. I feel like no matter how much HRT I might have, my glasses fell and broke and I won‚Äôt be able to go back. üòù And I‚Äôm happily married, but I‚Äôm no longer willing to give up certain things in the name of an old role‚Ä¶ though I know that would make things easier for my family to not have to work around my needs all of a sudden."
10uamb2,"I‚Äôm in post menopause at 45. I decided to come off opioids at the same time my menopause hit ü´£ (unknowingly) so my body took a hit. When your addicted to opioids it also messes with the Endocrine system/hormone levels. So I really had no idea what was really going on with me. It‚Äôs been a bad year mentally and physically. I‚Äôve always been active but there were times I wouldn‚Äôt get out of the bed for 2-3 days. I was depressed, eating junk..waking up in the middle of the night to eat BS. Hard time staying asleep, etc. I tried the ‚Äúall natural‚Äù path for menopause but still didn‚Äôt get any relief. HRT was the only thing that made me feel half way normal. I never thought in a million years..menopause would be this bad‚Ä¶we as women should of been warned/educated ü§®"
10uamb2,"Yes, HRT replaced my rose colored glasses and then cancer took my HRT away and I am just a bitchy, temperamental jerk again ‚Ä¶."
10uamb2,"Yessss!!! HRT is a game changer!! I struggled for a year‚Ä¶depression, mood swings, laying in bed for days, etc. HRT has given me back some of my old self. I‚Äôm currently on 5mg but I wear 2 at a time so 10mg. I go back to dr in March. What is your sweet spot as far as HRT goes?"
10uamb2,"I feel like the bottom line answer to at least *most* of the men that come here with these posts should be a simple: Get yourself to therapy. (Not your wife; *you*).

Therapy will 

(1) help to broaden the understanding of what women go through during this time, while 

(2) actively addressing the man‚Äôs own accountability related to his perception/behavior in the relationship (that includes leading him to inquire with strangers about his wife‚Äôs needs in the first place, rather than conversing about his feelings or concerns at length with her and seeking professional help that can actually assist him/them)."
10uamb2,"He says it‚Äôs longer than the ‚Äúpros‚Äù, she been working on this list in her head for a while now I‚Äôll bet."
10uamb2,"Lol thank you but yes I do 90% of the cooking still with my back issue. I make amazing meals. Yep we just had a dinner out. And yes i do house work. 
I rub her back to help her sleep, play with her hair all the love and support I can give her

I haven't responded much because I'm felling attacked but i do appreciate all the comments and we are going to talk to her doctor about HRT.  

Thank you everyone."
10uamb2,Thank you.. We really like your ideas.
10uamb2,Thank you for the suggestions. üôÇ
10uamb2,Thank you but yes because if my back issues I might get 5 hrs if sleep. My wife has no issues with sleep but I do.
10uamb2,Rooting for you both. Be patient - HRT took a year to settle down for me.
10uamb2,"Thank you for you input and experience. I'm very happy you and your husband made it. 

We have had the chat and we are working on it with my full support to her needs."
10uamb2,"Interesting. So coconut oil in her food? We do use coconut oil for massage. 

Thank you."
10uamb2,"Same.  I would add that myself and husband of 30 years found our way through this with therapy.  Talking to him without a mediator was futile, but when in sessions, he is genuinely engaged and willing to work through the tough stuff and has become more receptive to seeing me as a human with boundaries and feelings he doesn't have to understand, but can also not aggravate by being dismissive and cold.  He has more skills now too and as a couple we are thriving. Worth every penny to save the marriage.  Without it, I can honestly say, I had one foot out the door."
10uamb2,I concur to the 1000th magnitude!
10uamb2,"Absolutely!  I‚Äôm not married, but definitely wisdom worth saving for the future."
10uamb2,Right?!

10uamb2,"She probably wishes she could have you back as the man she used to think you were. When the scales fall from your eyes, they really fall. Are you there for her as she grieves for the husband she wanted you to be? Doesn't it suck that she has to go through menopause and also lose the husband you used to be, both at the same time?"
10uamb2,">I may not get my wife back to who she was

I hope this is unintentional.  You sound like you're longing for who she used to be, and will settle/deal with what shows up.  How would you like it if she said things like ""I miss who you were before, how do I get that man back""?

Watch what you say, it's coming across as, um, bad."
10uamb2,"You will or you do?

I agree with u/plotthick that I hope this is just poorly worded and isn't as bad as it's coming across."

10uamb2,"I read your comment to my husband. He said, ""You wrote that."" I said, ""Nope. Not mine."" He said, ""She thinks like you then.""

""Yep."""
10uamb2,I can see how you would not want to put the rose colored glasses back on! Good for you for finding your truth and speaking up. Healthy boundaries can change a persons life. You go girl!

10uamb2,"I am not through the process yet, I am one of the lucky ones who had ridiculous hot flashes, could not sleep for anything, and night sweats so hot my husband would also wake up drenched‚Ä¶.all while not missing a single cycle.  I am 51 and just can‚Äôt be that far away from them quitting. I am on a patch that is .05 mg and 100mg oral progesterone daily. That has my symptoms at bay for now."
10uamb2,"AND, many men have their own issues they refuse to deal with. They would rather pitch a good wife than admit they need help or guidance.  I told
My husband that I didn‚Äôt sign up to be married to a bachelor and I did the hard parts raising the family and doing my best but I wasn‚Äôt going to be in retirement with a man who can‚Äôt shift gears and couple up!  His choice."
10uamb2,"I don‚Äôt understand how we can be going through something that is EXACTLY -hormones drive us to erratic behavior -and throw out that men have unreasonable thinking. 
You can look back to puberty and see that hormones are uncontrollable. Grown men look back at what drove them in their teens and twenties and realize that testosterone wasn‚Äôt kind. We can look back and see that WE weren‚Äôt exactly right when we gave mom a rough time. And now WE want to be our rosy old selves but without HRT, we can do little to control our anger, anxiety, etc. 
c‚Äômon. Work on the hypocrisy."
10uamb2,"Put aside the ""feeling attacked"" part and reread everything. It's not an attack, it's trying to show you the why and the how. 

No one's perfect. But if you are trying to improve yourself ( and really, not just playing the part for a few weeks hoping it'll blow over) it will go a long way towards mending any divisions. 

It's not just about HRT. It's about you both talking about the issues and coming to an understanding. If the understanding is ""this won't work"", well, then so be it. For both of your sakes, get into couples' counseling. If you go to church they may have a free program. If one of you is working your insurance may have something. Otherwise, a lot of counselors will work on a sliding scale based on income. It's not just about HER, its about BOTH of you...so you both need something."
10uamb2,"OK, I am sorry that I assumed things. I hope you get better sleep!"

 Its a good thing that WE have the ability to see ALL this information, new studies on HRT and the many many benefits just by doing searches online.  


sharing our stories can help guide others where to look and what to try to find their combo for treatment and IT IS a combo of treatments ... ... I wish you the best in your journey :)"

Therapy *requires* some degree of empathy (for others or self) when it comes to how a person interacts with the world around them‚Äî and the end result there can often look like accountability. 

Let‚Äôs be really really *real* here. Online forums seem to just naturally encourage a person to want to be agreed with. Even here, with this amazing group of people on this sub, this Reddit forum will end up with several responses that will try to *appeal* to empathy and accountability‚Ä¶ but without the in-person application of tools and methods to change perceptions and thus behaviors, it‚Äôs appears (to me anyway) like shouting into an internet void to gain some sympathy for losing the amount of attention they receive, after years of being used to her putting herself aside. 

In my years on Reddit (new account though that won‚Äôt reflect that), I have yet to see any of the men that come here phrase things without focusing on how they are affected foremost, if you pay attention to the in-between-the-lines tone of things. A man that phrases ‚ÄúI want her back to her old self *for her*‚Äù makes me question- is that it really? Do you know if she wants her old self back? Maybe she‚Äôs happy coming into her own (men are allowed to come into their own at any time, it seems many of us women get forced into it during this time of our life- and the freedom we finally get from a taste of this is too good to push down and ignore ourselves any longer), and that simply needs to be accepted and respected?!"
10uamb2,"Well, I‚Äôm not following *at all* on the ‚Äúlet partners off the hook while we rage hormonally‚Äù line of thinking, if that is what you‚Äôre saying.

Correct me if I‚Äôm reading it wrong. I‚Äôm a legitimately smart person, but don‚Äôt follow the response. The claim of hypocrisy is tripping me up (as the reply is showing up under my response; maybe it‚Äôs just the mobile format, and not meant for me‚Ä¶? ü§î) 

Two things can be true: people in peri/post-meno can suffer hormonally, while their partner would be unreasonable in thinking that they have no responsibility in helping their loved one or relationship. (Of note: our suffering doesn‚Äôt give us the license to ruin our lives by unchecked behavior either, HRT or not‚Äî we still have a responsibility to love ourselves enough to help ourselves too, but that wasn‚Äôt my original previous point).

As teens we are thrown into hormonal changes that we lack tools for & I think most people understand why being a teenager is hard (lack of life experience married with increasing independence & interaction within more ‚Äúadult‚Äù spaces is overwhelming).

As adults we have ALL developed (hopefully) a better ability to navigate relationships. Of course a MAJOR drawback is that we also ALL have been historically disadvantaged by not knowing much about this ‚Äúsecond puberty‚Äù. I don‚Äôt disagree that longstanding medical neglect has birthed emotional neglect in relationships for lack of understating. I also am a proponent of HRT, never claimed or implied I wasn‚Äôt, as it‚Äôs been effective for me personally.

To imply ‚Äúdon‚Äôt blame the men for us being hormonal‚Äù. (1) I wonder what that POV rewards a person, in return for holding that perspective and (2) Partners in our life who don‚Äôt experience peri/post-meno still have the responsibility for their perception and behaviors. Are we supposed to carry everything forever, alone, and just because we are‚Ä¶ hormonal? *What?!?!* Expecting a partner to become informed on helping themselves (as much as us) is not asking much *at all*. 

People that ‚Äúget‚Äù therapy, and accountability, get my response. Just witness the lack of accountability in stories here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs actually *not* up to a ‚Äòhormonal woman‚Äô to go it alone in a partnership. I‚Äôve said it before, and will again: look to the younger generations for a timely example of how people giving their fair share in a relationship is now (always should have been) the norm‚Ä¶ more younger people (often women) are choosing singledom over unmatched effort‚Äî for great reason.

Bottom line for me: if a man wants to help his wife through this, he needs help too. It‚Äôs easy (though not sympathetic) to see someone suffering and go ‚Äúthey just need to fix themselves‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do I get them to fix XYZ so I can have the *old them* back‚Äù‚Ä¶ but where the hell is the love in that‚Äî and where‚Äôs the empathy? Therapy won‚Äôt be all ‚Äúman, take the blame‚Äù‚Äî it was suggested for the tools and tricks learned there, that work on thinking and taking action to HELP the man (and in turn the wife). It‚Äôs not hypocritical to suggest everyone do something to help their relationship."
10uamb2,This too but it wasn‚Äôt enough. If anything it cleared up some significant areas of my life where I could clearly see it wasn‚Äôt just me and my hormones.
10uamb2,Initially my primary prescribed it but now my ob is managing it. Finding the right doctor is key. Good luck!
10uamb2,"There are a shocking number of women who will jump to helping the men ""understand"" while simultaneously blaming ""menopause"" as an excuse.  I think peri and meno is where many women just wake up and don't want to take anyone's shit anymore. (my opinion)  It is freedom and fear (because we feel our bodies getting older), and we don't want to waste not one more day!  It's kind of like how some people, men and women, love to blame everything on our period.  Just because we bleed doesn't mean there isn't wisdom in what our hormones are telling us. Maybe if more woman listened to what their periods were telling them by securing boundaries, having expectations for self-care and mutual care from our partners all the years they were menstruating, they wouldn't feel the need to establish it all at once when the end is near.  It is a two-fold issue of woman believing everything is about hormones and men dismissing them because ""it is just hormones.""   Well, maybe it ain't.  Maybe it never was....   maybe women are just now waking up to recognize a misogynistic world where it is easier to blame hormones than it is to empower women toward self-care and boundaries.   The painful truth is that if a man decides to be a couple, then that means BOTH people are equally as important and valued.  I am not bashing men.  There are many good men too, but I do think we are still in the generation of turning the male centered beliefs of the past into more of a equal partnership that maybe our own daughters will experience hopefully resulting in less friction when THEY get to meno because they will nurture better partnerships with boundaries and self- respect for their own needs."
10uamb2,I was fully prepared for therapy to not work. And if he didn‚Äôt want to participate then I had my answer too.  And it was two fold for me. I couldn‚Äôt blame the hormones and neither could he. There was plenty of other garbage causing way more suffering than my hormones.
10uamb2,Very well said! And I wholeheartedly agree!
10z3vju,Yeah.  Middle aged women‚Äôs health is not a priority in medicine.   It‚Äôs  atrocious.
10z3vju,"I wrote a similar post a few days ago. I am baffled that of all the specialists I've been seeing over the past few years, no one brought up peri. And it's not an overstatement to say I'm distraught that no one talks about it, such incredible harm is being done ."
10z3vju,"I'm so sorry about that!  I went to my doctor yesterday to complain about nausea, armpits darkening/rash, insomnia, anxiety, extra PVSs (heartbeats), and she said, ""Hormones, hormones, hormones.""  I knew the insomnia and anxiety were related to hormones but the nausea?  And the armpit stuff:  she said that hormone fluctuations can actually change  your sweat and cause yeast infections in your armpits.  And the nausea/stomach issues?  Same as yours.  For me, a week of miserable nausea/can barely eat or work and the following week is ""sour stomach.""  She said that progesterone spikes can cause nausea and that it seemed to line up with my cycle. I said, ""Surely this isn't the normal experience.  I've NEVER heard about ANY of this.""  When I've heard about peri/menopause in the past, it was just *hot flashes*.  She said, ""Nope, this is a totally normal reaction.""  I'm just astounded that I'm 47 years old and was totally in the dark about all of this.  Anyway, she prescribed an Estradiol (sp?) patch.  Fingers crossed for some relief.  I hope your OB can help you out too!"
10z3vju,"I‚Äôm completely unsurprised by the female healthcare workers‚Äô reactions. üòî 

My mother was a RN for decades, and didn‚Äôt realize her peri issues *were caused by peri* at the time. And of course none of her doctors really mentioned it either. It‚Äôs like they could tell her ‚Äúyou‚Äôre post menopausal now‚Äù‚Äî but not a thing up until her not having her period for a year! Even today, she‚Äôs got a really weird attitude of the transition from an experience *and* healthcare standpoint.

For me this just highlights how negligent the medical community has been toward women‚Äôs health concerns. (They gaslit generations and convinced them not to even think about it‚Ä¶ ‚Äòcause thinking leads to questioning that leads to demanding change and attention, which nobody wanted to give the women who came before us. It‚Äôs criminal.)"
10z3vju,"It's SO infuriating! I've been dealing with similar issues for yearssss, eventually blaming a lot of it on allergies because I just didn't know what else to try to address for the fatigue, fog, insomnia, palpitations etc. At no point has \*anyone\* ever suggested peri (I'm nearly 52!). Because I'd had anxiety issues in the past, I think it mostly got lumped there and subsequently dismissed. If I hadn't had some issues weird enough to eventually find some info on my own, it probably still wouldn't have come up. Meanwhile, my life has gotten worse and worse, I'm so foggy and tired I can't work right now, had to move in with my mom.... And even then, it's only from spending time in this sub that I realized the MHT is theoretically supposed to help with that, too--my dr here was kind of horrified I was on anything at all, I feel lucky that she agreed to keep prescribing. I'm so sick of having to be my own dr all the time, especially when \*I'm\* the one with the hazy brain. My GP here seriously went for ""maybe you need a brain MRI..."" vs hormones!"
10z3vju,"That is ridiculous. I am experiencing bad gut issues too, that are chronic. My PCP at least acknowledges it's due to menopause because the drop in estrogen causes delayed gastric emptying. Even my gyno denies half my symptoms are due to menopause. It's frustrating to have health issues swept under the rug."
10z3vju,Ask to get your hormones tested
10z3vju,Not being a priority might even be tolerable. The horrible part is that it's not even *on their radar!*
10z3vju,"Women's health is only a priority if it involves reproduction, for everything else men's health is the priority."
10z3vju,Women‚Äôs health in general isn‚Äôt a priority
10z3vju,You would think that our health insurance would figure this out! Patient is a forty-something year old woman- let‚Äôs try MHT instead of sending her to a dozen different specialists and at least one expensive scan. It would save thousands per woman. Besides the whole quality of life thing
10z3vju,"Thanks! I forgot to mention nausea in my long list of symptoms, I definitely have some of that too! I am so glad you found a doctor who is knowledgeable!"
10z3vju,"Oh man. I just got the armpit rash, along with nausea and left side pain. Come on!!"
10z3vju,"It really is criminal! I am so glad I found this sub, and heard that podcast. I was really getting frustrated by all of the symptoms and know they're not just in my head!"
10z3vju,"Even when you're told ""post menopausal"" there's not much more information after that. I go to a nurse practitioner for primary care and she is awesome. AND knew when she was out of her depth and she referred me to gyn. After the exam the gyn said keep using the estriol cream your primary gave you and Nystatin cream for external itching. Both primary and gyn tested for everything, no BV, no yeast, no STI's and both tried to culture urine but both cultures were cancelled bc I had no UTI. Nystatin didn't help bc I didn't have a yeast infection. She didn't even tell me what I was diagnosed with and I was stressed so I didn't ask. I had to find out a couple days later when they upload the visit summary: atrophic vaginitis. You'd think I would have at LEAST been told what was going on. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm in the middle of a total misery and can't believe that I have to search everywhere online to find things to help. I've started telling every woman I know in her 40's and 50's about things I've learned (a lot from this sub, I'm so thankful for y'all) about menopause and that ""vaginal dryness"" really means horrific burning up your hoo hah. We are totally unprepared for menopause and health care professionals don't know enough (or ANYTHING) about it either."
10z3vju,"Tale as old as time: When the male-dominated medical industry can‚Äôt figure out what is the actual physical cause of women‚Äôs signs and symptoms, it must be in her head. Look at the lopsided ratio of female to male diagnoses of somatoform psychiatric disorders: a whopping 10:1 (you can look up the various ones in DSM 5). There is *no way* that lopsided ratio isn‚Äôt driven by the lack of awareness and correct physical diagnosis of women by medical professionals as compared to men (source: I‚Äôm a clinical psychologist). It‚Äôs unacceptable."
10z3vju,"Oh my gosh really?? a BRAIN MRI?? I have several chronic health issues, some took years for diagnosis, one only took about 6 months. But I understand the process with those things. What I don't understand is that every woman goes through menopause, so why do Drs know so very little (or nothing!) about it? We need help! From health care professionals who actually know what they're doing on this!"
10z3vju,I plan to but I know after reading the FAQ here and some other things that a hormone test isn't very useful in peri!
10z3vju,"I know!! Shouldn't that be the first line?? Even presenting with mental health issues, there is a questionnaire for menopausal depression and I bet none of my providers have heard of it. 

https://www.maprc.org.au/sites/www.maprc.org.au/files/MENO-D_0.pdf 

My score was 34, with a score of 32  indicating 'severe menopausal depression needing treatment '"
10z3vju,"Sea Bands help a little...somehow!  I can totally track my nausea with my cycle.  The past two days, slightly queasy.  PMS due in a couple of days...right on track.  Doctor says that you can't ""stop"" the progesterone from making you queasy but it helps a little to understand why it's happening.  I'm hopeful that the patch helps, too."
10z3vju,"Yeah, I thought that maybe I'd developed an allergy to my deodorant.  Doctor took one look and said that it was a yeast infection and since it started when I was hit by all these other symptoms, almost certainly hormone-related.  Sigh..."
10z3vju,"Yes, same!!

And I agree about being thankful for this sub & the people here. üòä I‚Äôll have to check out that podcast."
10z3vju,"It's incredibly misogynistic, I can't even wrap my head around it. I have started telling all my early 40s friends too. I am used to having to advocate for myself for practically everything, but it still angers me to no end! Thankfully it does seem that awareness is raising more and more, maybe by time my 12 year old daughter is going through this there will be better care available. ugh! All we can do at this juncture is keep fighting for a better future for younger generations, and our own, I guess. I really appreciate you sharing your story. I am sorry you are suffering, especially since there are ways to minimize this suffering but the doctors don't care/arent informed enough to figure it out!"
10z3vju,"Hey, I appreciate you and those like you! As much as I love my mother, she‚Äôs been a dry well on this topic and I feel out on a ledge by myself about it. I welcome older women telling me what to expect. üíï"
10z3vju,"I shared here before that about ten years ago my old (male) gynecologist told me I was suffering from Hysteria. üò≥ I was like, ‚ÄúYou mean the thing from the 1800‚Äôs and early 20th century?‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúIt still affects many women today‚Äù. 

We are still in the dark ages of medical care for women‚Äî the ‚Äòthey have this mystery thing we don‚Äôt know how to deal with unless we put them away‚Äô  (or to simply ignore it) mentality persists! 

(Which is why I never second guess telling my story, even though it might be repetitive to the sub regulars. And that is, that I put MYSELF away *before anybody else could* two weeks later ü§£‚Äî I have to laugh about it, or I‚Äôd probably cry to think of the lack of intervention involved to help me‚Ä¶ and it did end up being the ‚Äúgrippy socks vacation‚Äù I needed, so nobody should be too afraid of getting help if they need it. üíï)

While he wasn‚Äôt wrong that things were going bad for me, he wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful *at all* as far as ‚Äúdo no harm‚Äù goes. As he said, ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre suffering from something called Hysteria‚Äù, he simultaneously neglected calling my husband (or even my psychiatrist or therapist, who he knew as a ‚Äúteam‚Äù that we set up for me during pregnancy‚Ä¶ oh, I didn‚Äôt mention yet that I was postpartum)‚Äî he just let me walk right out the door and I deteriorated into a shell of a person for the following two weeks.  ü´†"
10z3vju,Thanks. I‚Äôm using this!
10z3vju,that's what I thought too! the deodorant! hope you feel better!
10z3vju,"That's awesome that you are telling the pre and peri women also! Like you said, I think there is starting to be more awareness but it seems to be taking a grass roots type movement of women telling other women, in person and on subs like this, to get the word out. My daughter is 27 and about to have her 2nd baby but you can be sure I'll be talking to her after that! üòä

I found this [interview](https://youtu.be/5oi4wVewMjQ) with a woman named Jane Lewis and Dr Renee. In it, Jane is very open and her passion is sharing the info she has learned with other women. She has a hidden Facebook group (I'm not on FB but if you are, check it out if you are interested) and wrote a book called ""Me and My Menopausal Vagina."" I just started reading the book. The other great thing I learned from this interview is about a product called Olive and Bee intimate cream. It really helps with external dryness and itching and there are only 2 ingredients; olive oil and beeswax.

If we all start talking about menopause and all the things that might happen, we can be a part of raising awareness and help women not be totally caught off guard when it happens to them! üòä"
10z3vju,"Thank you! As awkward as it can be to talk about (if I don't know the woman well), I don't want anyone to go thru this blind like I have been. (My mom didn't talk about it either.) And also every woman will experience it differently. I didn't know that either. I thought I was weathering menopause really well! No hot flashes, no night sweats, no mood swings. Until an episode of painful sex and stubborn vaginal dryness reared their ugly heads lol! ü§™üòä"
10z3vju,"That's terrible!! I'm so sorry you went thru that!! üòû Any Dr that tells someone they're suffering from ""Hysteria"" shouldn't be allowed to be a Dr. And it definitely sounds like doing harm to not call your husband and health care team!!"
10z3vju,"Oh. My. God. My jaw dropped when I read that. I am so sorry you had to unnecessarily suffer that fool (and asshole, really) of an incompetent doctor on top of the suffering you were already enduring. Tell your story! People need to hear it (women AND men!). Someone should have reported him to the state licensing board out of their own concern and/or on your behalf, including, but not limited to another member or your care team. That‚Äôs medical neglect. You had enough in your plate. I did that once concerning another doctor of one of my patients (specifics were different, but the issue of medical neglect of a patient clearly in crisis was the same). 

I am happy you got the help you needed and are strong enough to advocate for yourself today. But it shouldn‚Äôt be *this hard* for anybody. And not all people have the stamina at a certain point to keep trying, or they can‚Äôt even think clearly due to feeling overwhelmed, or they don‚Äôt have the resources/access (even if they DO have the psychological stamina and clear thinking) to get help before the worst case scenarios happen. Avoidable tragedies."
10z3vju,"One hundred percent women even 20 years from now are going to look back on this era the way we look at medicine from the 1800's -- ""how barbaric!"""
10z3vju,Thanks for that link. I am collecting all the information I find like this to add to my arsenal of awareness to share with others.
10z3vju,Same.
10z3vju,"Thank you. üíï 

Looking back I know I should‚Äôve handled that whole situation differently but I was honestly in and out of it at the time to start with, and then my husband was in near-crisis mode figuring stuff out with me so it was just *a lot*. üòä"
10z3vju,"It‚Äôs wild isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs totally a, ‚Äúif I knew then what I know now‚Äù situation and thought to report I would have. 

And jeez, I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like on the provider side and seeing other providers that share your patient fail them!"
10z3vju,Agreed!
10z3vju,"Sounds like we here are all doing that same thing. I'm so glad! It will mean fewer women blindsided and suffering, at least in our circles. üòä"
10z3vju,Yup. Younger gals won't have to wake up one day and wonder why no one ever said anything about it. They will know they will be aware. And they will ask for what they need or demand it.
10z3vju,Yesss!! üôå
110kc9b,Before I started HRT I had awful panic attacks. Mine feel like darkness is closing in around me. Any chance this could have been one?
110kc9b,You say you haven't had hot flushes yet but this could be one. You don't have to be sweating to have suffered one x
110kc9b,"Probably contact your doctor and see about getting some bloodwork done. Perhaps it's a deficiency of some kind. The first part of what you wrote reminded me of hyponatremia, which my mother deals with, but the other things you mentioned aren't things she‚Äôs experienced. I hope you figure it out soon."
110kc9b,I'm glad you've posted this because I've had that distant feeling constantly for over a year since I had Covid in Jan 2022.  It affected my hormones and I'm in the perimenopause now.  I got a blood test at a menopause clinic and it showed that my hormone levels have all declined.
110kc9b,I'm just hoping this feeling doesn't last for years and that it'll clear soon x
110kc9b,Dry mouth can be a sign of panic attack. This might be it. Hormones definitely cause this.
110kc9b,"This does happen to me sometimes. Doing absolutely nothing of incident and suddenly have that drawing away down a hole type of distancing then panic as I snap back and sometimes a warm or buzzing feeling in the back of my head. I also have had MRI and EKG, Sonogram of chest/abdomen, chest x-ray etc and nothing. I too think it must be the hormones as it gets more frequent at certain parts of my cycle. I have found it lessened when I started taking magnesium glycinate. I wonder if adding in potassium too might eliminate them?"
110kc9b,"The best way that I can describe this feeling is as if watching a cartoon and the pov of the watcher is drawn back for several miles. I have even had the hearing in my ears feel like this. As if it was being pulled through one ear and out the other.

I went through peri-menopause at the same time I was being treated for treatment-resistant depression. So many of the medicines have side effects that duplicate peri symptoms ie hotness, and anxiety. So even though you didn't mention anything like this, I just want to validate your experience because if anyone has had a series of weird effects with both situations, I have."
110kc9b,"There was a time I felt like I had suffered a mini stroke, I just lost concentration, felt dizzy and dumb in one side of my body. I immediately went to bed and have never felt that again but it was unnerving and had to demand tests to prove I didn‚Äôt have stroke. Hormones are F‚Äôing us up"
110kc9b,I‚Äôm thinking maybe you were so relaxed you were approaching a meditative state and something snapped you back to the present.
110kc9b,Sounds a bit like a panic attack tbh. Mine have me go cold though.
110kc9b,"Depersonalization, a form of anxiety"
110kc9b,"I consider that a panic attack. I had my first one when speaking in front of an audience. Then I would wake up with them at 3 am before I started taking magnesium, HRT, and got a less stressful job"
110kc9b,"Sounds like a wave of anxiety or even a painless migraine which has happened to me a couple times when I got too dehydrated. The first
Time it happened I thought someone put drugs in my snow cone at pride fest. The whole room was shaking and I couldn‚Äôt stand up. It was dehydration and heat that caused it for me"
110kc9b,"Maybe... but I wonder if this wasn't perhaps a very minor brain mis-fire? Either way, I'd call your doc, just run it past them, see what they think."
110kc9b,"I've had increased anxiety in the last couple of months, so it's possible. Though I've experienced true panic attacks a few times before and this was different."
110kc9b,I had panic attacks too. One night I was trying to fall asleep and my brain said to me ‚Äúyou are going to die. RIGHT NOW.‚Äù And my heart palpitations started. I woke up my husband and said ‚ÄúI feel weird‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt really tell him more. I just tried to go to sleep.
110kc9b,I have panic attacks and anxiety. On estrogen gel which hasn‚Äôt helped. Starting vaginal progesterone suppositories tomorrow. What kind of HRT helped your panic?
110kc9b,"My husband actually said the same thing last night, could it be some type of a hot flash. I guess it‚Äôs possible!"
110kc9b,"Just had a physical last month with extensive bloodwork, which was all OK. Also had EKG, ECG, brain MRI recently, normal. I'm thinking it goes back to the hormonal fluctuations that have been even more pronounced for me since November."
110kc9b,"Sorry you're experiencing a similar issue, I can't imagine how unpleasant it is to have it constantly :(. From what I understand, Covid does affect the nervous system also and hormones as well. Hope it gets better soon!"
110kc9b,üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
110kc9b,Good point!
110kc9b,"Ugggh, so sorry you experience this too! I have increased my Magnesium Glyc. dose a few days ago, I was definitely not taking enough. Also including coconut water daily for potassium and electrolyte packets. I am actually trying craniosacral therapy tomorrow for the first time, in hopes of it helping me work on my nervous system, which I believe has suffered so much in perimenopause."
110kc9b,I‚Äôve had this feeling many times since I was a very young person!
110kc9b,"You've had a rough ride, dealing both issues at the same time, so sorry. I hope you're feeling better. I am not on any medications, but did start B1 thiamine a couple of weeks ago, to help with my nervous system regulation, and it has actually worsened my anxiety, so maybe that played a role."
110kc9b,"Oh my, the stuff we go through! That is scary. Five-six years ago, I was in some waiting room with my kids and my right arm suddenly went numb and then I felt a jolt of something in my head, it was very quick but definitely terrifying, also feared it was some kind of stroke - had an MRI the next day and nothing was seen. That was in the earlier days of perimenopause for me."
110kc9b,"That's interesting, I guess anything is possible :)"
110kc9b,"I've actually considered this and have been reading about it. But I thought derealization was more of a mental/emotional feeling, while this episode I had was a physical sensation. Or could derealization be physical also?"
110kc9b,"Maybe, though I've had panic attacks before and this felt very different. But it's possible!"
110kc9b,"Hm interesting. I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety all my life and even several panic attacks last year, but this was a different feeling, though it could be tied to anxiety of course."
110kc9b,"So sorry :(  This stuff is so hard at times. I try to explain it to my husband and as hard as he tries, I think he really has no clue what I'm talking about most of the time. Like last night, it really freaked me out when this came over me and he was asking me what's wrong and I kept saying I don't know, I feel like I'm not here. He just looked at me like I had two heads."
110kc9b,Combo Divigel and Medroxyprogesterone
110kc9b,My flashes are well weird and it took a long time before any sweat was involved. I get mouth burn and a feeling of warm fluid on the brain üß†
110kc9b,"Really, anything is possible. I had a bunch of occasional episodes during my mid 40s that were almost like dizziness, but not quite - and also sudden and gone as fast as they came.  

If you‚Äôve already been checked out by a doctor, my suggestion is that you make sure you stay sufficiently hydrated, that you‚Äôre getting enough fluids throughout the day."
110kc9b,Thanks yes I hope youdpnt have it too severely.  I've been feeling really lonely all year and I know I've been pulling away from other people but it's hard to resist the temptation. I can't bear to be around other people sometimes. X
110kc9b,"Wow! I would be curious if the craniosacral helps, please give us an update or another post. Anything I can do to whittle away at these issues is worth giving a look in my opinion."
110kc9b,Good point. Thanks for your response. Wish you good health. Too!
110kc9b,"Yes, I've had it many times.. it is a creepy feeling,  but not harmful. Sorry that your having it..."
110kc9b,I‚Äôm glad your issue wasn‚Äôt a stroke or something!!! I would suggest an absence seizure but probably just‚Ä¶good old menopause. Stay well!
110kc9b,"Wow, something was definitely wrong with my mouth immediately afterwards, it was dry and my tongue was burning slightly. And also got a weird warm feeling in the back of the head for a few moments, before it all passed."
110kc9b,"Definitely had this about a year+ ago, often around breakfast time and this lightedheadedness definitely felt more hormonal than dizziness, but sudden anxiety, lightheated, sweaty and nauseous. I definitely have been really pushing a lot more of the water and fluids and it's seemed to help"
110kc9b,"That is rough. All this stuff does make you feel lonely, not even my husband can begin to understand what all this feels like, even though we talk about it so much."
110kc9b,">absence seizure

Ugh you scared me a bit. Just read on what absence seizure is ""Someone having an absence seizure may appear to stare into space for a few seconds. Other symptoms include lip smacking, eyelid fluttering, and chewing motions. The seizure still starts with staring into space, usually with a blank look."" I did not have any of those symptoms."
110kc9b,It really sounds to me like a hot flash. My mouth can also get a metallic taste and kind of feels like I've been sucking on a pepper pot. I grind my teeth also and this makes it worse.
110kc9b,That sounds like a hot flash maybe? I haven't had them yet but from what I've read they sound like what you described.
110kc9b,Yes men can be sympathetic but they'll never experience what we have to go through xx
110kc9b,"Definitely possible that‚Äôs what it was. The last couple of months I‚Äôve had more menopause-type symptoms, including some vaginal dryness, which is a totally new thing for me ü´§, so it‚Äôs possible that hot flashes are starting too‚Ä¶"
110kc9b,This must be one of many menopause symptoms cause I grind my teeth constantly.
110kc9b,"Thank you - it's reassuring to hear someone not living in my head that that's what it might have been.  It was very weird because it left me feeling hot but didn't think it was it, because I was seeing it tied to 'dizzy, low blood pressure' rather than being flushed and sweaty, and the most recent times have happened in bed.  But I definitely need to track this better and see if it's tied to certain times of my menstrual cycle, if that's even a thing.

Our bodies are these remarkable ecosystems but lately it feels like all the planets are starting to just be out of kilter and I HATE it."
110kc9b,Yep very possible hon. Are you on HRT for peri?
110kc9b,It‚Äôs rough! ‚ù§Ô∏è
110kc9b,"I am not on HRT. I do use Progesterone cream and oil sublingually in luteal phase only, but I actually do not tolerate progesterone well, it caused me panic attacks last summer, so I had to lower the dose significantly."
110kc9b,I'm the same with progesterone but everything has been made better for me with Estrogen.  Good luck anyways üòâ
110kc9b,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10xk6zb,"Wow. Thank you for this. I had no idea what to even consider expecting. Honestly, this probably made me more nervous. I don't know why I didn't consider the possibility of being pantsless, or touched, but I didn't. Did you expect that, or was it a surprise? I know nothing about the process, so I'm happy for the details!"
10xk6zb,"this is awesome, OP!!  I'm so glad you had a good experience and finding things out that will help you.  PFTs are awesome and really should be promoted more for women's overall health! I really don't know why the medical field doesn'r do this.  

Once you hit a certain age and/or give birth, your pelvic floor changes and your body unknowingly tries to compensate for it that manifests in strange ways!  one of my sister's friends stopped having sex with her husband because it became painful and she had no idea why....her PFT fixed that.   I have issues with my pelvic floor being too tense so I'm squeezing my bladder too much and gives me that urge to pee.  I had to learn how to relax my muscles and retrain my brain/body to give different 'signals' based on my breathing and relaxing my muscles.

for all those who want to know what the initial assessment exam is like (this is a general description):  they use a finger (inserted into the vagina) to gauge/understand the issue(s).  There are 3 'levels' (look at your finger):

* level 1 is that first line closest to the tip of the finger.  They insert their finger up to that point so just around the edges of your vaginal opening.  
* Level 2 - they go a bit deeper (to the middle line of the finger).  They ask you to breath deeply, contract/release the muscles per their instruction so they can assess.  
* level 3 - they go a bit further beyond that middle line on the finger to check around (internally) the muscles that are close to your anus (no, it's not through your butt but there are small tendons and muscles that surround that entire area that can be reached via the vagina).  

that is the only time I was internally examined but they may reassess after a few sessions to check on progress if there are severe pelvic floor issues.  The PFTs are super professional (at least the ones that I saw) and they explain everything before they do anything (they should even before you get undressed!)."
10xk6zb,"Sounds like a really productive experience, good luck and keep us updated!"
10xk6zb,"Very interesting! And for the rest of my life, whenever I see a blueberry, I will think of this!ü§£"
10xk6zb,"Since joining this sub a few months ago, I‚Äôve wondered if I need to see a physio therapist. You‚Äôve convinced me."
10xk6zb,Thanks for posting this. I have never heard anything about any of this.... Wow.
10xk6zb,"I had some wonderful visits with a Pelvic Floor/Abdominal PT following hernia repair surgery last fall.  Katie was wonderful.  Though I was there for core strength, she also evaluated my pelvic floor.  It's because of Katie that I have my prescription for vaginal estradiol.  She said that you can have high enough circulating estrogen to not have hot flashes, but your vulva and bladder may not be getting enough. Katie sent a note to my primary physician recommending it, and it was written (my primary was only offering advice to use KY jelly, and said it's ""just as good as estrogen"".  Nonsense! I will need to find another doc to get system HT when I'm further along in Menopause.  Mid--to-late Peri as far as I can tell)  I think the estradiol has really helped my bladder urgency and has made things feel more comfortable, juicy and strong.  I no longer feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a UTI.
Katie also evaluated whether I had any prolapse (only the most minor form, typical of someone with two vaginal births, nothing to worry about) and confirmed that I was doing Kegels correctly.  
I asked her what I needed to know to keep my pelvic floor in good shape for the rest of my life and she said 
1. Estrogen  
2. Walking 
3. Fiber (the end of constipation would take away about 50% of their business). 
4. Don't go pee ""just in case""  Wait until your bladder tells you it's time.  Something about about the muscle that contracts to empty your bladder.  Exceptions are made before getting into the car for an hours-long drive, of course.
5. Sex, if you want it.
Katie also worked on my hernia incision to soften and loosen the scar and make sure it didn't have any adhesions to nearby tissue that would be painful.  I did have a few twinges around the incision before she started, but now it's feeling great.  She does a lot of work on Cesarean scars too (Not relevant to me)
If you have a chance to see a Pelvic Floor PT, I highly recommend it.  They can help with issues you didn't know you had and improve your life!"
10xk6zb,"I absolutely adore my pelvic floor physio, she has made such a huge difference to my quality of life!

I am going to use your ‚Äúbuns of jello‚Äù mantra, I find it much harder to relax my butt and rectal muscles after a few months of the Physio. 

Im happy you had a good experience OP! Woohoo!"
10xk6zb,"That sounds fascinating. I'm in the UK and never heard of a pelvic floor physio before, will need to investigate!"
10xk6zb,"Thank you for posting this! I wondered about all of this, and I would like to explore it because of painful sex. I hope I can find someone knowledgeable like this. Dilators--must look these up."
10xk6zb,Very very interesting!
10xk6zb,"Thanks so much for this post, not TMI at all! I keep hearing about the benefits of pelvic floor PT and having this description is going to help me a lot with making an appointment and trying it."
10xk6zb,"This was a cool read. When I was in physio for my arthritic shoulder/ torn rotator cuff, my physiotherapist told me that there was such a thing as this (we had lots of time to chat), and could even refer me if needed. I'm not sure if it was through the hospital system or if it was private-- it wasn't offered in my hospital, but might've been the one upriver from me. Either way, I didn't take her up on it since I was only having stress incontinence during bad colds and no sexual issues at the time."
10xk6zb,"Thank you. You convinced me! You have no idea how much I needed to read this today. 
Thank you so much"
10xk6zb,"Physio here, very happy you've had a great experience. Will be taking the advanced training to add this to my practice later this year."
10xk6zb,"I feel you on the pelvic tilt/tuck thing‚Äîhave had it embedded in my brain by strength training coaches. 

So we simply drop that? Or selectively choose it when riding or protecting our spines when working out? Can‚Äôt we have it aaaaallll??"
10xk6zb,"Thank you for sharing this, such good information."
10xk6zb,Thank you so much for sharing! What are your issues that made you seek help?
10xk6zb,"I suspected, but wasn‚Äôt sure about how intimate she was going to get with me. I don‚Äôt tend to be shy about doctors seeing or touching me since I figure they see thousands and I‚Äôm nothing memorable.

She was very careful about ensuring my comfort with the proceedings. If I wanted it to be less intrusive we wouldn‚Äôt have done as much. She has ways of assessing that don‚Äôt involve her touching or looking, but they‚Äôre harder for her."
10xk6zb,"This exactly! She kept talking about my bladder, which wasn‚Äôt my area of concern because I had learned to live with it, but as she talked I realized that I might actually be able to improve that aspect as well. 

Oh how I wish I had learned about this sooner."
10xk6zb,I‚Äôm enjoying the image of you giggling your next family get together when they serve blueberry pie and wrestling with trying to explain the humour ü§£. The crushed blueberries were obviously from some unsuccessful pelvic floor exercises.
10xk6zb,"I was also told about the peeing. No need to go just in case if I‚Äôm only heading out for an hour or so. I tried to persuade my bladder that it was just an urge this morning until the cat jumped on my belly and I realized it was a real need.

I‚Äôm glad there are so many positive experiences out there. It feels like I‚Äôve just discovered a secret that shouldn‚Äôt be a secret."
10xk6zb,"It‚Äôs a two part treatment. Have to get the tissue plumped back up with the hormones, which she can‚Äôt help with, but she can help reduce the risk of pain by teaching the body to relax.

It was interesting how she was very clear that we needed to teach ‚Äúthe body‚Äù and not me. It‚Äôs very much not a mind over matter approach and removes a lot of pressure from me. I can‚Äôt will this to be better no different than I can will a broken leg to be fixed."
10xk6zb,"I‚Äôm going to be mentioning it to my sister who also suffers from stress incontinence. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll help, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt!"
10xk6zb,"It‚Äôs such a wonderful group here. We‚Äôre all trying to find our way and each journey is different. The PT told me she wanted to give me enough knowledge to be able to ask questions that I wouldn‚Äôt know to ask.

I hope your journey goes well!"
10xk6zb,"I hadn‚Äôt planned on seeing a PFT at all since I didn‚Äôt know it would be helpful. It was the menopause specialist who told me it would be good. I went to the menopause specialist specifically for insomnia, muscle aches, and just feeling like they could help me in general. I had just sort of assumed that painful sex was my lot as my regular gynaecologist had tried a number of things, including using ketamine to numb me, and nothing had really worked.

When the menopause specialist did the exam she noted the vaginismus and said that it was very much a contributing factor to painful sex. She thought the PFT would also help with constipation and bladder issues.

By chance I was able to get in to a cancellation at a local PFT and here we are!"
10xk6zb,">Oh how I wish I had learned about this sooner.

off topic but the other day I heard an ad on the radio about men's sexual health:  

""do you have problems maintaining your erection?  having issues with premature ejaculation?  low libido?  Come to <Clinic Name> for help!  6 locations to service you around the metro Toronto area!"" 

And all I could think is, how typical.  Men getting help for this stuff when millions of women all over the world suffering from difficult periods, awful and lengthy peri/menopause symptoms and pelvic floor issues! and then I got mad at society for only giving a shit about men's health and nothing for women's health."
10xk6zb,I love your second paragraph! Separating it as a physiological issue would definitely lower the pressure and shame I put on myself. I like thinking about it like that. Thanks.
10xk6zb,That's incredible! So happy to hear that your specialist suggested this.
10xk6zb,Fuck the patriarchy
10xk6zb,Yes! I didn‚Äôt realize the impact of what she was saying until I got home and even into this morning. It‚Äôs very liberating.
10fbx53,"I feel like saying I‚Äôm out of fucks is not quite accurate. I feel as though I‚Äôve realized no one cared about any fucks I or we had to give in the first place. 

I don‚Äôt want a career. I never did. Whose dream is that? To work? That‚Äôs weird and I will (probably literally) die on that hill. 

All I ever wanted was to be able to survive and possibly enjoy myself. That requires a fair amount of money in this dumb dumb deeply dumb world. 

So be it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to care about your stupid business. I‚Äôll quit at a drop. 

That is a fuck I never had. I know the capitalist powers that be have not and never have cared about the workers beyond the labor they can give. They happily and historically let us die once our worth is gone or never apparent so fuck them too. 

I ‚Äúquiet quit‚Äù the minute I was employed at my first job. They give the bare minimum so so I do too. Side note fuck you Kroger.

I found nasty emails written about my intelligence from the owner to the woman that ‚Äútrained‚Äù me.

It's not that I quit, it's that I need to be doing something else. Preferably something that doesn't involve someone looking at my gray and 20+ years of experience and deciding my fate before I can get a word in. Ageism is so hard to prove.

It's a shift. As a creator I won't be able to afford much, but it should keep me out of jail."
10fbx53,"i've worked in a plant for 18 years. in the past 2 years (or since peri), the physical toll has been tolerable; the mental toll has been devastating. i wasn't able to drop work off at the turnstile as i was leaving. i brought it home with me and dreaded the next day. i didn't sleep well most the time due to anticipating the day coming, and many mornings spawned panic attacks and crying fits to the point of calling in and using most of my vacation days because i just *could not* fathom being there. i worked with both men and women. i can say that the women made it much more difficult on a daily basis. the cattiness, the backstabbing, all of it was contributing to a hostile work environment and i really just wanted some sisterhood at such a shitty, trying juncture in my life.

the way it works in the plant is that they post job bids to move to a different department/job. i've signed 4 now in my 18 years, and signed one before Christmas of 2022 to go to a small subsidized plant 3 miles down the road affiliated with the big plant. i got the bid and now work with 10 men. the work is hard but the atmosphere is laid back, and there is no pace like what i was used to before. the guys treat me like one of them and i swear, being around all the testosterone must level me out, because i have felt better since starting there than i have in the past 2 years of this crazy peri roller coaster. i am able to drop my work off at the door and drive home in much better spirits. i sleep better, feel better; it even has sparked my libido to an extent. i wish i had done this years ago. i was seriously contemplating quitting, leaving my bread and butter, my benefits and insurance, because i was so miserable and felt so stuck and sullen. this was my ""Hail Mary"" play, and i think it's going to win the game for me.

i know not everyone has an option like this, and i am grateful for it. but i think of all of you on this sub quite a bit. i hope that something big and wonderful comes along and helps pull you through these times. we all need to work for obvious reasons...but to be subjected to added hostility and shittiness in the workplace, well, you're just looking for a crazed woman on the 6 o'clock news claiming temporary insanity due to hormones. godspeed, sisters ‚úåüíõ"

That aside, I have been looking forward to retirement since the day I started work.  I never dreamed of work either.  Dream Job is an oxymoron to me.

You may be able to ease into something that way?  Can you create a volunteer opportunity where one doesn't yet exist in an area of interest to you?  I know a woman who loves gardening.  She'll go to smaller churches, nursing homes, pre-schools etc.  and volunteer to  do gardens for them & the upkeep.  Most of the time the place she goes buys what's needed & she just puts her love & energy & spirit into it.   It allows her to create & be involved on her terms.

 I had a job working with adults with special needs as an employment coach. I loved my clients, and it was really rewarding working with them. What's keeping me from going back into that field is that, despite my love for my clients, there was so much bureaucracy around it, the directors making me spend the majority of my time with one particular client who was a higher billing rate for the state. I had eight individuals that I was in charge of one-on-one job coaching, training, job searching, etc. I was expected to spend approximately 65% of my time with this one girl who had no interest in working.

10fbx53,"A significant number of people are leaving the workforce because they're becoming disabled by covid. In the last three years, this has happened with my friends who were previously able to work, all in our forties:

* one was already working part time due to disability, got long covid, unable to work at all

* two had been able to work full time, now have long covid, not able to work but really hoping they'll recover

* one burned out in academia, always talking about being exhausted, and got pulled into a scammy MLM thing, so that's probably going to get even worse

* one had suspected covid and dropped dead of a heart attack a month later, aged 45.

That's just the ones I can remember off the top of my head, there are probably more. Since I'm disabled and many of my friends are too, a lot of them weren't in work to begin with. 

Covid is making a significant dent in the number of people in the workforce. It's showing up all over the stats. So it's not just you. More people are quitting. We're living in a different world.

10fbx53,Does quiet quit mean working but not quitting? I love your outlook.
10fbx53,"If the Prime Minister of New Zealand can wake up one day and very publicly announce that she has no more fucks to give, then we all can."
10fbx53,"In my twenties, I was all ""jobs are important, contributing is important"", but since then, I'm like ""fuck work culture and capitalism, life is all about having as much fun as you can, while also making a difference in other people's lives somehow""."
10fbx53,Completely agree!! Feel the same!
10fbx53,Damn sis - that‚Äôs exactly how I feel.
10fbx53,I feel exactly this way. Everyone wants their dream job or to do something they‚Äôre good at. I just want to earn a wage that lets me live comfortably. I don‚Äôt care what it is; of course I‚Äôd prefer an easy desk job or something but I‚Äôm not afraid of manual labor. I do NOT want to work for work‚Äôs sake. No company gives a shit about us! I did work for a great company for quite a while and still kick myself for leaving but I hated my quality of life. I thought the money wasn‚Äôt worth it to me. Now that I‚Äôm not working I see different but am I in a rush to go back to work? Hell no. Too bad I can‚Äôt afford to sit on my ass. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be one of those people that will do what I love. I used to envy them but work has just never been that important to me as long as I can take care of my family.
10fbx53,"Sadly, we have feminism to blame. They thought all women want to take care of the kids & work‚Ä¶.like it‚Äôs actually possible to ‚Äúdo it all‚Äù & enjoy it‚Ä¶"
10fbx53,"I agree that this is part of it. Most of us are Gen X and we did get the short end of the stick. I know that at my job the Gen X crew are the ones that miss the least amount of work, we have a different approach to our work and get assigned more work due to this. I have had to stop this with my manager because it was becoming overwhelming and thank goodness, she is interviewing someone to come help us, but we have no idea how long they will last, because our most recent hires have an extremely poor retention rate because-healthcare.  We also got shorted on pay increases because of policy changes, recessions, and as you mentioned-boomers stayed in the job market longer than anticipated.  I‚Äôm trying to hang on for 5 more years, but damn, I wish I could hang it up today and move out to my remote nobody-fuck-with-me property‚Ä¶"
10fbx53,Totally agree with the view that covid has taken a serious toll on folks. People simply don‚Äôt give a shit nor are they motivated at all. Maybe the gen x and zeros have it right. I am on the taile end of boomers( Dec 1963). What the hell was I working so hard for? Just trying to hang in there and not seem too old and bitter as I think I need to make to 65! Trying to find a way to handle the stress of my job as I can tell that I am slipping‚Ä¶ wonder how much others notice. Faking it until I make it‚Ä¶. to 65!!!! What are your fav coping strategies?
10fbx53,"This is one of my biggest problems with university faculty working until they die basically. They've got a death grip on jobs that should have gone to gen X by now. There's also evidence that we should all basically retire by age 70 if we can, since that's the age when most folks start to experience cognitive decline. I had to work with a late eighties faculty member for years who was a huge grouch and had the memory of a goldfish. I had to re teach him how to use the lms, use the room a/v system, and how to use zoom every week for years. He finally retired at like 89/90."
10fbx53,"I just reached my 25th anniversary in my gov job.  My go-to when people ask when I'm retiring - when I reach 30 years or my husband dies, which ever happens second.

Follow up - my husband has Type 2 D, Lymphedema in his legs, and family history of cancer.  I'm terrified of what the cost of his healthcare would be without the gov employer supplied health care."
10fbx53,"Tell your husband to show you all of the finances, especially the things that back up his claim that you can't retire. YOU should know your finances as well as he does. And you may discover that you're able to say to your husband ""I am working another __ years and that's it. We will make it work. I'm done."""
10fbx53,Yes. Smile and nod. Agreed.
10fbx53,"Did i write this?  I too am 51, in government employ (since 1999) and So Ready To Be Done."

10fbx53,"Wow, I want the form that you take! Mine helps with a lot but I‚Äôm still a shell of the person I was."
10fbx53,"Indifference. This is me. I have a great job - wfh, good pay, excellent benefits. I even like my co-workers. I just don‚Äôt care anymore and have no motivation for this part of my life. I have even less motivation to job search and make a change. That sounds exhausting. 

I think it comes down to having different priorities in my life - I want to spend more time with my dog than my work. I want to travel, do house projects, read books.  I do not want to go to meetings or respond to Teams messages anymore."
10fbx53,Yeah. I feel indifferent too.
10fbx53,Youre amazing. I love your confidence
10fbx53,Good for you! I have similar story. I left for same reasons. Managers think we desperately need their job so we will accept any type of toxic work environment. Never did I think I would experience workplace bullying at age 59! No job is worth that kind of harassment
10fbx53,Good for u!!! How do you survive financially??
10fbx53,Sending you love and support. I get it.
10fbx53,I am so sorry you are living this. Not much I can say except I get it and I hope you get the help you need.
10fbx53,Yes. Ageism. Sigh
10fbx53,I really am happy for you.

10fbx53,True that
10fbx53,Iceland sounds amazing!
10fbx53,"Yes! Me too (started my own business in 2021 and having fun with it). Also, Iceland sounds perfect."
10fbx53,Thank u. I was thinking the same. Essentially comes down to boundaries
10fbx53,You definately can get BHRT that restores your hormone levels to that of a 22-year old if you are in the US. That‚Äôs what I take. Fiddling around with low dose hormones was getting me nowhere.
10fbx53,This is me. Thank you.
10fbx53,Wow. Really !!!!??!? Amazing fact
10fbx53,Good move. Hope you are better.
10fbx53,True that.
10fbx53,How can i learn more about how to invest?
10fbx53,For that you need a ton of money!   There‚Äôs no way I can not work.
10fbx53,"Agreed though not everyone can do this. Me, I‚Äôm retiring early with plans to move out of the US. The cost for health insurance would obliterate any savings I have."
10fbx53,no kidding. it's not like people are doing this intentionally
10fbx53,"Some people are already living on a shoestring best they can.  

We all have needs and not many get away with doing absolutely nothing for what they need, but the the ‚Äòwants‚Äô are pretty subjective.

Ouch, this hit me where it hurts. This is exactly how I feel."
10fbx53,Right? I work in product design. My products all end up in a landfill pretty quickly. It‚Äôs depressing.
10fbx53,So much of what I do is just being a cog in the bureaucracy machine. It's truly soul killing.
10fbx53,"The meaning doesn‚Äôt help that much. I worked a job that was important to many different industries and if it stopped for whatever reason, those industries fell way behind and there was always this pressure to produce. I personally didn‚Äôt like the pressure. There‚Äôs no way to be satisfied."
10fbx53,Me too
10fbx53,It means doing what I‚Äôm paid for. Nothing more or less. Pay more get more.
10fbx53,I love the PM of New Zealand.
10fbx53,"It‚Äôs an extra layer of depressing because yeah, we should contribute to society as we can. We aren‚Äôt though. We are contributing to some rich asshole. The social contract has broken."
10fbx53,"I'm not sure feminism is to blame - the idea with feminism is that women should be able to pursue their goals as individuals and enjoy equal rights in society. The idea being that there is no one ""right"" way to be a woman. Be a stay at home mom. Be a career woman who never marries or has kids. Have a career and a family. Live with your girlfriend and 13 cats. Take up carpentry, build a swamp shack, and thrive as a bog witch. All valid options! No, I think capitalism is to blame - that's the system where survival is tied to creating monetary profit."
10fbx53,"I don‚Äôt have kids. If that was your takeaway from feminism you got it all wrong. Like, really wrong."
10fbx53,"This isn't a feminism thing, at least in my opinion. I like to work and feel like I have something to offer the world. To contribute in order to make it better for everyone..... but I do not want to put everything out I can, get nothing for effort. There is no time for life/work balance atm."
10fbx53,"Someone was talking about how in person office work was so much better than remote because you get pulled into meetings and projects you wouldn‚Äôt be adjacent to online and my response was ‚Äòugh, why would you want that?‚Äô  

We are already ‚Äòdoing more with less‚Äô.   Its not like anything else ever gets dropped off the plate just because you took on something new.  I‚Äôve seen how they address mental health and burnout and disability.  No one from work is going to be at my bedside holding my hand.  

At my work they stopped doing fun stuff and there is zero financial incentive to doing extra. 

‚ÄòKeeping your job‚Äô isn‚Äôt even a valid threat in my line of work - I could have another job in a week, but it would most certainly be same shit different pile and at least I‚Äôm familiar with this pile and don‚Äôt have to learn a bunch of new names. 

I told my husband I‚Äôm perfectly happy having ‚Äòless‚Äô stuff in our life and a simpler lifestyle if it means we don‚Äôt have to take shit from our jobs from this point forward and can retire earlier."

10fbx53,"Oh, I'm freelance now and I turn jobs down if they seem like too much of a pain in the ass, but I'm fortunate to be in a position to be able to do that. (I don't have a pension but spouse does.)"
10fbx53,"I work at a university too, and let me tell you! Ugh."
10fbx53,"After 65, you get Medicare‚Ä¶"
10fbx53,"I‚Äôm in the opposite boat, I can‚Äôt get a job because then I‚Äôll lose my government Medicaid, which gives me my CPAP supplies free and my $900 a month migraine med free, and a long list of other medical expenses that I have all free. When I was working for the largest hospital in the state, the health insurance did not hardly pay for any of it. Tons of out of pocket expenses. Quitting was the best thing I ever did."
10fbx53,THIS THIS THIS.
10fbx53,"Well I‚Äôve been going thru it for over 7 years now on my 3rd script and wonder if I‚Äôm almost done?? Giving up Booze and eating less and has made a huge difference this month.

10fbx53,"My god, Teams.  I started a job that uses it and it is rage inducing."
10fbx53,We are the same.
10fbx53,You are my people. I did the job search to get out of my super stressful underpaid but high recognition job and at my new much less stressful better paid job I have zero fucks to give.

10fbx53,"you ain't kidding. i grew up with 2 older brothers and have been a tomboy all my life. i've always been go with the flow and easy to get along with, but have struggled relating to other females. i never understood the backstabbing and making fun of other females because they were considered not as cool or pretty. i guess i just wasn't implanted with the tools to join in or be so cruel to others...but yes, though men can be big babies and gossipy at times, they still are easier to be around and relate to for me."
10fbx53,"I work in technology. Being vague for privacy reasons , but the gist is that I'm essentially a mix

10fbx53,"Oh that's a tricky question.
Depends on how much money you can put aside from your salary into investment.
Let's say you can save monthly 100¬£ or 100$ invest in financial instruments like shares. Now the market is low but stick to shares that have fundamental values such as Tesla or Apple.
You can also invest in mutual funds. There are various risk types so take the one you feel comfortable with.

The primary rule when you invest is only put money you can afford to lose. Because finalcial market is volatile mostly is you try the ceypto currency market. Which I do not recommend unless you read about it and follow what's happening.

If you can save more, let's say 1000$ buy a house if you live in a country that provides mortgage with fix rates for the whole lenght of the mortgate term.
When it's varaliable rates it's not worth to buy a property.

I rely more on financial investment because I work in the area üòÖ"
10fbx53,Ditto and I‚Äôd venture a guess more of us are in this proverbial boat.
10fbx53,"I know that I will leave, it's just a matter of when. Unfortunately, we need two incomes and it is not quite time to leave the kids to their own devices when they get home from school. So for now, I'm still working nights at a job that I really don't love."
10fbx53,I changed careers and have more meaning now. 30 years in CPG stuff sort of makes you‚Ä¶tired.
10fbx53,"Same. I worked in marketing. Selling shit to people that they didn't need. I quit last year after 25 years of working. Not sure what I'm doing next. I'm lucky we are in a position that I can take a rest, but I need to figure out what's next."
10fbx53,Me three!
10fbx53,Well shit. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúquiet quitting‚Äù for almost 20 years now. üòÇ
10fbx53,"Yes!!! My feeling exactly. Always been that way bc I never saw the benefit in the payoff for a promotion for the extra work and stress I would take on. I have enough stress, thank you very much."
10fbx53,Yeah most jobs are designed that way. You really have to fight to be able to do anything that makes a difference in the lives of us commoners.
10fbx53,"I‚Äôve done all sorts, mainly call center as a fall back. I‚Äôve always been under employed. Problem is when you‚Äôve only done what society considers ‚Äúlesser‚Äù work that‚Äôs all you get considered for. I actually have a  Masters degree but was never able to put it to any great use. I‚Äôve just always been so happy doing household tasks (for myself). 

Most jobs are mindless busy work for 8 hours a day. I have ADD so I get bored easily. I was also never very career oriented. There wasn‚Äôt anything I wanted to be career wise. I‚Äôm not competitive or ambitious as far as that goes. 

I‚Äôd say as far as feminism, I‚Äôm not a feminist, I‚Äôm more an equalist. Everyone should have equal opportunity to pursue the direction they want in life regardless of gender race etc.

As a single person I am forced to work. Single people have it super tough. I wish more attention would be focused on that."
10fbx53,Some women want to be stay at home moms
10fbx53,This is truth!
10fbx53,102 acres of get-the-fuck-away from me was purchased last year‚Ä¶gonna turn it into my swamp witch/bog witch/native everything oasis‚Ä¶

10fbx53,"Yes!!!!! Retention bonuses, etc‚Ä¶all dried up but the work load was still there‚Ä¶"
10fbx53,I'm sure you've got all sorts of stories too.
10fbx53,"And that's about eight years away for him, and fifteen for me, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't cover near as much as what my government job provides."
10fbx53,"Medicare part A covers inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing care, things like that. It does not cover regular doctor visits. 

For doctor visits and other outpatient care, Medicare recipients have to purchase insurance under Plan B. They pay premiums and co-pays just like with any other insurance. Prescription costs are also a separate plan."

10fbx53,"Workers! Our labor is our power. UNITE OR DIE. 

I just ate some cake and am hyper now. BRB. Gonna start a revolution."
10fbx53,"I second this! Life is basically unbearable without 2 incomes now. This is wrong on so many levels. We can‚Äôt all have partners. We can‚Äôt all be tied to our work, to be defined by our job. I hate the way our society defines us. I‚Äôm so glad people find their calling and make a difference in the world. I sometimes wish I could be that way myself but I am like you. I have no big ambitions but I‚Äôm always made to feel guilty about that. I‚Äôm in a midlife crisis right now. I need a job and am considering a career change and possibly school. How the hell do I decide what to do? I have no particular interests or hobbies that would make me money. I have no idea how I will be in a new job with this new outlook on life of no fucks given. Who would want to hire a menopausal woman? üòÇ why does life have to be so fucking hard?"
10fbx53,That's like... the first option I listed as an example of many valid options.
10fbx53,All I ever wanted was to stay home and cook and clean. I never desired to be in the workforce. I was forced to.
10fbx53,That‚Äôs fine. Feminism has given you the right to choose that rather than to be forced into it. Go marry a Mormon or some shit.

10fbx53,[deleted]
10fbx53,Mind if i ask where?  I totally want to quit & move to Santa Fe!!!!
10fbx53,"From a quick glance, my current coverage is better.  I get massage therapy, dental and vision, which Medicare specifies that it doesn't cover, plus, my husband hasn't worked in over 15 years, so he hasn't paid into it much, so there's also extra costs there.  I'm sure there's even more if I want to dive into the coverage of other specific elements, copays, or deductibles.

I've also got several coworkers who agree with me, in that they're choosing to keep working for this city government for as long as they can just because of the medical coverage, including one who has close to 50 years in.

Anyways, it'll be at least five more years before I qualify for retirement, and as I noted, ten beyond that before I qualify for Medicare, so until then, at minimum, my current employment provided coverage is better."
10fbx53,It was a jibe. All the traditional family values men are trash. They want baby machines who slave away. That includes many many religions. Most of them really.
10fbx53,"My man is convinced I'll love the Joshua Tree area and I sure did when we visited it in January last year! At this point any change that isn't my body sounds good lol. And his mom will be an hour away.

10fbx53,[deleted]
10fbx53,Oh shit I forgot about that recent story. Big oof me. Lol.
10fk1zp,It's a shame that we just aren't given any tools to prepare for this point of our lives and it's almost like \*it doesn't even exisit\* outside of the folks affected by it.  I make a point to share it all with my grown daughter and my two granddaughters so it won't catch them as off guard as it did my generation.
10fk1zp,I would totally attend a conference on menopause. I‚Äôd like to attend a panel called ‚ÄúHow not to kill your family/friends/coworkers while in a hormonal rage.‚Äù
10fk1zp,"""OK girls one day the magic will happen! Here's a small disposable pillow,  enjoy your new life!"" And what happens when I'm older? ""Oh we don't talk about that.  Just know that one day the monthly red faucet will just turn off and everything will be just fine!! Don't you worry none,  go out and I dunno,  just go do something. "" 

40 years later I want to just SCREAM.  What would the harm have been in telling us that we'd face 30 years or more of cramps and mood swings then move on to hot flashes, saggy breasts, dry vaginas and homicidal thoughts?

I think we're all owed free lifetime wine and icecream."
10fk1zp,I‚Äôd like a class called ‚ÄúMaking Your Physician Listen To You‚Äù
10fk1zp,One hundred per cent ! It would be great if we could all lie in beds for the duration ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm exhausted 24/7 !
10fk1zp,"Take my money!
Another Idea: a new kind of Bloodmobile that actually rolls in to town and picks up perimenopausal women to have ‚Äúclass‚Äù with a guest speaker wine, snacks, a good cry and conversation"
10fk1zp,I can‚Äôt even stand myself. I‚Äôm hot. My boobs sweat. My head hurts. My stomach is weird. I feel stupid 90% the time.
10fk1zp,This made me laugh as I lay here in bed day two after a complete hysterectomy.  Who knows what awaits me.
10fk1zp,Let‚Äôs make this happen. A symposium?
10fk1zp,"I‚Äôm so grateful that we have created our own class here.  I would have gone insane if I didn‚Äôt have this place. 

Also, with equal parts bitterness and pride, I‚Äôm reflecting that no one else ‚Äúhelped‚Äù us.  We did it on our own, because that‚Äôs what we do."
10fk1zp,I am FULLY in love with this idea. And we have TOTALLY earned Swag Bags!!!
10fk1zp,What‚Äôs in the goody bag???
10fk1zp,"We had a Teams session in work about the menopause that was provided by our work EAP (employee assistance program) provider, and it was great. The guy presenting it was really knowledgeable, sensitive and helpful, and it was very cathartic for so many of us to be talking about experiencing the same thing. We've got about 450 staff, about 50% women, and I'd guess about half of the women are at peri/meno age, so there's a lot of us going through it. Every workplace should have the same thing, we're playing catch up after years of silence. It was uplifting to see quite a few men attending as well, knowing that there are men out there who want to be better informed too."
10fk1zp,"I feel like I got shafted when no one told me about life after giving birth, and now this. NO ONE told me this. Not even my mother. How? Why? I mentioned my new stomach pot belly to my mother, and she just said, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs where you store your estrogen now.‚Äù Wait. Hold on. So you knew???? And you didn‚Äôt tell me anything???"
10fk1zp,Brilliant. A friend of mine wants to start a podcast too.
10fk1zp,"Wine, dark chocolate, sticker, t-shirt (moisture wicking and/able to be a lounger welcome). Between ‚Äúconferences‚Äù we don‚Äôt just share with each other - we get a paid next conference registration if someone we know writes or videos in sharing what they learned from us that helped them be prepared."
10fk1zp,"Oh my god! I was just saying the same thing to my friend the other day! Lol- including the huge maxi pad!
Sign me up!"
10fk1zp,"OMG giant maxipad! 



Buried that memory."
10fk1zp,MenoCon.
10fk1zp,P.S. THANK YOU all for making me laugh :p
10fk1zp,"I was literally just talking about this in another sub!  We need a ""Welcome to Your Body"" class for perimenopause!"
10fk1zp,Yes!
10fk1zp,I'm in!
10fk1zp,"Wait, I can barely remember my name, I'm constantly irritable, and I'm too tired to go to the grocery store, much less a class, especially [gasp] in person.

This is why we're luckier than our moms:
We have the Internet. So we can get all of this knowledge from the comfort of our pajamas.
This is our class. Lol"
10fk1zp,I'm in! Tell me when where and how to make it happen!
10fk1zp,This sounds lovely!
10fk1zp,"Love this.  They did NOT cover perimenopause in health class. I am educated, but didn't know about perimenopause until a few months ago when I was searching like crazy to figure out what was wrong that doctors couldn't seem to figure out.  Until I informed myself about perimenopause I (embarrassingly) thought menstruation just literally stopped one day versus slowly progressing over time. Facepalm."
10fk1zp,let's do it.  I am in the process of building an apparel brand (Hot Woman¬Æ) that helps normalize menopause/peri menopause.   more to come on that :)
10fk1zp,"I imagine we could have a really fun , healing and informative conference yet  are too addled to organize such an event .
I went to a Rolling Stones concert and the one of best parts was coming and going in droves with people my age ! Not since high school üòÇ"
10fk1zp,"you are on to something,,,im in."
10fk1zp,"They didn't gender sort us! We had sex Ed multiple times, the first time I was young enough that I don't remember it! So the next time we did it (in middle school) it was more in depth than before but nothing was a surprise.

I want men to know this stuff too, y'all. It's part of the burden we carry as the ones who bear the children. I want them to KNOW."
10fk1zp,I'm in.
10fk1zp,I‚Äôm in!
10fk1zp,Hell yes. With wine and chocolate.
10fk1zp,"I'm in, sign me up!!"
10fk1zp,"Thirty years ago, I was fifteen and sat in front of a male doctor in late middle age who cheerfully told me that yes, this was migraine, and I'd have it until menopause.

Looking back, I feel I could have done more of the death glare.

Anyway, my sex ed experience was different to yours. I'm 45, grew up in England, and moved to Scotland at 18.

Primary school - I don't think there was any.

Secondary school - I went to a girls' school, so segregation wasn't an issue, but I suspect the boys' schools were taught less about us. Very little health ed or sex ed, blink and you missed it. Fuck all about contraception, let alone other issues like consent, which they mercifully cover now, and I don't remember a thing about menopause.

University - the LGBTI society made damned sure we got good sex ed to catch us up. Admittedly it was a little light on the contraceptive side of things, more about safer sex, but it equipped us to learn on our own, and it meant that I went to the Family Planning Clinic for long term contraception the morning after I first had sex. 

I've spent the years since shocked at how little the heterosexuals have been taught. You have to explain very carefully about typical use vs perfect use stats for contraception, that condoms are meant to be used with lube. And if you blush and can't say the word ""lube"", you may not be ready for sex. I have one friend I've known since school who is straight, and she's dead nervous about discussing menopause at all. I was worried I'd shock her by saying I'm on vaginal oestrogen. I don't think she talks about it with anyone. 

The queer community hangs together, and we held onto that ability to talk about sexual health. The best advice I've had on vaginal atrophy has been from a trans masculine friend, because it's an effect they get from HRT. One of the best advocates I know for abortion rights is a trans woman. Seen that ad for how to do testicle checks featuring a drag queen? There's a reason for that."
10fk1zp,"Yes, a class would be nice but also, how about more research and better treatments? I pay through the nose to have the top of the line BHRT and I now have hormone levels of a 22-year old, and yes, it takes away the hot flashes and keeps me out of jail or the psych unit, but I‚Äôm still struggling so much with horrible bizarre symptoms‚Ä¶. Short of breath, tiredness, weight gain, pain, excessive sweating in terrible places, irritable, mystery depression, memory issues, I just never feel well. I‚Äôve been checked over every which way but Sunday and no one can find anything wrong!!!! There‚Äôs gotta be some additional phenomenon that goes haywire at 40 besides just sex hormone aberrations. Otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt hormones just fix everything?"
10fk1zp,I still vote for sending our partners who don't experience menopause into another room to learn about it too!

10fk1zp,"I'm convinced this is why there's so many ""Karens"" losing it. (I don't mean the racist kind, I mean the flipping-out-on-the-cashier kind.) I see these women having full-blown tantrums - they're my age usually - and I LOATHE their behavior, but I also wonder in the back of my mind if they're just having a bad menopause day that turned into psychosis. Lol."
10fk1zp,My husband says there's a menopausal murder movie on one of his favorite horror channels.
10fk1zp,What on earth was the small disposable pillow?!
10fk1zp,"Oh, a disposable menstrual pad? I don't even remember being shown anything, though it will have been covered in the one book we were given. My mother kept freaking out and complaining that the book ""taught us to breastfeed"". My mother provided no sex ed at all. So I remember grimly trying a tampon on my second period, aged twelve, and nearly passing out."
10fk1zp,"I was just going to say, who are these experts at the conference because I can‚Äôt find them anywhere and I‚Äôd like them to talk to other doctors first."
10fk1zp,"My daughter texted me at 5:05 pm, are you awake? I was like why did you ask that? She said you always go lie in bed after work now. 

Screw you. I have have been working for almost four decades, I am tired."
10fk1zp,Maybe it can be at a movie theater with those reclining chairs. Cozy blankets available if you wish. Having to sit in conference room chairs would ruin it for me.
10fk1zp,"As someone who has to spend most of the day in bed due to disability, 0/10, do not recommend."
10fk1zp,The boob sweat is just insult to injury!
10fk1zp,"Then to top it all off my gut told Me yesterday something was OFF. Yep! Had a sit down in my work performance. 110% my fault. Just having a hard time focusing plus office traffic. Everything just keep spinning some days. Today i kept my office door closed all day and it was better.  I just don‚Äôt like being closed in all day. And the cherry on the sundae is I have a big mouth and lately opens before I catch it ‚Ä¶. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Not that that makes things worse ü§£ü§£ü§£

10fk1zp,"THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 

I‚Äôm millennial/gen x (on the brink) and got bitch slapped with early menopause in my 20s. I‚Äôm on HRT now and it helps, but my brain still isn‚Äôt fully normal‚Ä¶.I had no idea how major meno could be. So, I tell everyonneeeee. 

Like, I cannot believe no one tells us this shit is coming. Why you might wake up feeling like you‚Äôre about to have a panic attack. Or basically have morning sickness. THE BRAIN FOG. And the insomnia. And the anxiety, holy shit. The hormonal-depression-hell. The hot flashes, ugh. The absolutely detrimental mental health impact estrogen withdrawals can have, especially if you already have mental health struggles. Just to name a few fun meno things no one prepared me for. 

Keep telling people. We gotta prepare all our sisters!!!"
10fk1zp,No joke men should be educated on this
10fk1zp,LOL. Fingers crossed that none of us end up on the wrong end of a viral video.
10fk1zp,Lol this is great!
10fk1zp,"God. This reminds me. I was about 30 and working as a waitress in a high-volume French quarter restaurant. 
I had reached my quota of just horribly, unreasonably rude women. And they were always accompanied by the nicest of husbands/partners. (I guess I don‚Äôt wonder about WHY? so much now. üòÇ they‚Äôd likely been put in their places before they‚Äôd left their hotel rooms.)
Anyway, this one women was just non-stop ugly, and I just snapped. ‚ÄúYa know‚Ä¶ you may just wanna get your hormones checked before ya leave home!‚Äù
Yes ma‚Äôam. Here I am. I do not go out. You‚Äôre welcome. 
But I DID KNOW IT WAS HORMONES. And all thanks to my personal temper flares whenever I ventured to try birth control pills. 
That was 25 years ago. I told MY doctors what hormones do to me. I‚Äôm sure at least a couple of others have. Why haven‚Äôt hormones been figured out? 
Yes, let‚Äôs get together. Fantastic party favors/treat bags. Let‚Äôs do this."
10fk1zp,It seems disturbingly more possible. As someone from the service industry I hate those tantrums so badly but a little part of me completely understands. I lost my shit in my truck the other day because of a horrid driver and thank god there wasn‚Äôt a camera on me.

10v7zjt,I cannot imagine the absolute hell of what this woman experienced.
10v7zjt,"I think that's a legit connection. 

Trauma overlaps. Nothing occurs in isolation. Menopause has always impacted how women relate to the world/themselves/others.

Maus is really intense and I imagine the podcast was, too. Make sure you take care of your own feelings. It is triggering stuff."
10v7zjt,Kate Spade was 51 when she died.  I knew of 7 other women who killed themselves at about age 50. I believe  They were all menopause related.
10v7zjt,"i would also say that with depression/alcoholism/codependency/addictions- we tend to decompensate and spiral with age. it gets worse, much worse as we age period, and would only be exacerbated with changing hormones and pressures of middle age"
10v7zjt,"It is another aspect of the holocaust I never thought about or considered.  What it was like afterwards, especially for woman I just could not imagine picking up those pieces.  Than you start menopause, your body is changing,  your mood, the lack of sleep and all the other things, and you also need to take in the concept that. it was rarely talked about than."
10v7zjt,Thank you for this post. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10v7zjt,I just wish we could get word out to all the women in the world about the very real and very debilitating symptoms of menopause. They need to know what they are going thru is normal and that there is help available.
10v7zjt,"This post reminds me of the post partum period (menopausal now) when I wanted to know about the world I had brought my beautiful baby into, and I read nothing by Holocaust related material. I was already deeply depressed, so you can imagine...

I have had suicidal ideation a number of times during perimenopause. At least I have been able to work through these episodes, perhaps understanding that my change of life is analog,  or a bookend, to the time I was post partum, and understanding it is hormonal disruption and will pass.  

I am sad for what our grandmothers went through without information and support. 

I have always been sad for what we put people through on our planet. 

Let us make this world a better place through the respect and compassion that we may learn on this site."
10v7zjt,"I would absolutely believe that.  My grandmother was born in Europe and immigrated to Canada when she was five.  That woman lived through absolute horrors.  I still don‚Äôt know her entire story.  When she reached menopause, she had a breakdown and was institutionalised on more than one occasion.  She was administered electric shock therapy and was then diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.  She died in a mental institution in her 90‚Äôs.  she was a very traumatised woman.  When you looked in her eyes, there was nothing there."
10v7zjt,That part of Maus is very powerful.  Art Spiegelman can draw someone's pain so eloquently.  Thanks for bringing this up... I should read it again.
10v7zjt,"I cannot imagine what horror this poor woman went through. She must have been very strong to manage as long as she did. 

I wonder if in such cases, tranquilizers aren‚Äôt the better of two awful options. howeverr maybe she tried and they stopped working as the are wont to do.

So many women die by suicide because they feel trapped in a horrible nightmare with no way out. I am not there yet, but I  an relate. Later generations will probably look on this and be appaled and horrified (hopefull)."
10v7zjt,I‚Äôm so sad and hurt for her. What a prison her thoughts and emotions must have been for her. Poor dear thing.
10v7zjt,"Thank you for sharing.

May her memory be a blessing. 

What a powerful connection you've made. I absolutely believe it to be related. 

I'm going to Israel in a few weeks and am both looking forward to/dreading visiting Yad Vashem."
10v7zjt,"It's been very common in Holocaust survivors to be confronted with the memories in aging. What you mostly hear about is what has happened as people lost short-term memory and were left with old memories, so they were reliving these episodes all the time. There were suicides that came from that as well."
10v7zjt,"Thank you, I appreciate that. It is validating and triggering and the reminder for self care is a good one."
10v7zjt,This an area of suicide that probably has been under- or unstudied.
10v7zjt,Don't doubt it one bit
10v7zjt,"Very true, and with little or no warning the intensity of it can be very surprising."
10v7zjt,"Exactly, plus all of her older female relatives were killed when she was a young woman so she didn't have any of their stories or experiences to observe."
10v7zjt,Definitely. I wish she could have known to get some extra help because there's no way menopause would have been easy for her.
10v7zjt,Which help is available? Honest question here
10v7zjt,It strikes me as cruel that people can endure trauma and then be brought to their knees by menopause. I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother suffered so much for such a long life.
10v7zjt,That's a good point. What a horrible thing for them to inadvertently remember and revisit when you would hope for them to have peace.
10v7zjt,[deleted]
10v7zjt,"Truly, or worse yet, brushed under the rug"
10v7zjt,"HRT for me, but even just someone who listens and cares and knows what is going on would be a start. So many women are caught off guard and have no idea what is happening to them. Doctors run a million tests and put them on all kinds of meds- for classic perimenopause. Totally missed so much of the time: it‚Äôs fucked up"
10v7zjt,I just realized that I am more afraid of this than I‚Äôm willing to admit.
10v7zjt,"Yeah. What hasn't helped is that for many of them, English or Hebrew or Spanish or whatever they acquired in the new country was a language learned, or become fluent in, in adulthood, so that's part of what goes as well. The massacre of the Romanian Jews was profound, but many escaped, and wound up in Israel, New York, Montreal, California, South America. And as they age and memory goes the overlay language also disappears. It's not easy to find an in-home care nurse who speaks Romanian and will understand what the waking nightmares are about. Usually the grown children don't speak the language either, because the entire force of living, surviving, was about pushing forward: don't look back. Speak English, speak Hebrew. Drugging the old survivors is much easier for the nursing homes.

The traumas carry forward in the children and grandchildren as well. It's only in the last few years that it's occurred to me that of course there aren't great big families: 80% of the people in those families in Europe, which is where most of the Jews were, were murdered in the space of four, five years. And all the survivors are survivors of genocide, of course there are effects. It takes many more generations than that to rebuild a family and restore health.

Had America not had a massively open immigration policy between 1880 and WW1, as in show up and if you're not insane, a criminal, or diseased you're in, there would be almost no Jews left in the world. They mostly came fleeing pogroms back then. The Russians and Poles were less systematic."
10v7zjt,"WOW.  Thank you!  I'm in the range so this really shocks me.  But it is especially interesting as I'm working on a history of suicide and I teach a women's history course.  I think maybe it's time I talk about menopause, in all its forms, to my class of young twenty-somethings.  No one EVER said anything to me, and my mom died at 47.  Thank god for you all and the subreddit!  It is truly a life saver!"
10v7zjt,"Dear god, so the research is just ignored. Women can be super high risk and doctors shrug and say that it's natural."
10v7zjt,"It truly is. I didn‚Äôt have the slightest inkling it would affect mental health so severely - and no one watched it even though I have a history of depression.

Same with post partum depression btw, I even told my doctor I might be in danger there and still no one watched that. And I had it pretty badly for a few months."
10v7zjt,It's good to realize that early I think. We can all be here for each other and get the help we need because we will have the information and knowledge and support we need
10v7zjt,That is a huge consideration - the loss of language and no one understanding leading to despair. You've given me so much more to think of here. This has so many ripples.
10v7zjt,"Yup, even women doctors"
10v7zjt,[deleted]
10v7zjt,"Exactly. No one tells us, no one cares. We have to tell and care for each other"
10v7zjt,There's an excellent article about that in last week's New York Times.
10v7zjt,[deleted]
10v7zjt,My eyes were so wide when I was reading that.
110si5k,Time to go looking for another doctor if he is doing this.  Your health is more important then messing with a doctor who isn‚Äôt listening.
110si5k,I‚Äôm convinced doctors start doing this when they no longer want to treat you. I had an endocrinologist who stopped taking my calls. I‚Äôd leave a message with his receptionist over and over and could never get a call back or a prescription filled. I have an autoimmune disease that I take medication for daily and now I couldn‚Äôt get my medicine. I finally had to get an emergency prescription filled. I was so angry. This is your notice to get a new doctor.
110si5k,You are getting bad care. Switch doctors. There's a reference here in the wiki that has menopause focused doctors.
110si5k,"You know, even though your new family doctor is young, your case will help him gain confidence. Especially if he is willing to listen and hears about your past experiences and takes note. 

Whenever I am asked if an intern can sit in on one of my appointments,  I agree so as to help the next generation to get as much experience as possible."
110si5k,"Ooh, I like the fresh, younger docs. Their bedside manner, in my experience, tends to be better than the veteran doctors‚Äî they‚Äôre closer to *not* being doctors still, and seem generationally (yes, I meant *generationally*) more empathetic and willing to enter a partnership, than a power dynamic. My first younger doctor was my cardiologist and the amount of eye contact he makes at first made me feel weird, until I realized- it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs listening! üòÇ Maybe your primary could be a good place to start until you get into a new gynecologist. (Or plan B could be going with something online geared toward peri/meno while you look for a gynecology in person.)"
110si5k,"I have had a great experience with Winona - it‚Äôs tele-health team. I couldn‚Äôt find an in-person doc that had any expertise in perimenopause, it‚Äôs so frustrating. I hope you find some help soon."
110si5k,"So what if your family medical doctor is fresh out of school. He's a doctor right. He can listen to your problems and recommend a new gynecologist. Give him a shot before you write him off, he may surprise you."
110si5k,Where are you in the menopause transition?  Have you gone 12 full months without ANY bleeding?  What is your MHT/HRT dosage.
110si5k,"It literally feels like because we are over our reproductive age, we no longer matter. I feel you and hope you can get another Dr who will listen to you and offer working solutions"
110si5k,Is there a nurse practitioner or ARNP in his group? I have found they are so much more attentive and less busy because people prefer full doctors.
110si5k,"I think it would also be a good idea to make a complaint . When you have found a solution after yourself first, of course. That is appalling behavior and it should be reported."
110si5k,"Time for a new doctor. He is out of depth and sounds like he knows it and is trying to shake you loose so you find someone trained in menopause care.
Don‚Äôt take
His inadequacy personal- just find a new doctor. This is not your fault, but his"
110si5k,Can you ask your family doctor for a referral to a new gyno?
110si5k,"Go to another doctor. I've been through 7 gynos. The last one was a woman who finally listened to me. In the meantime, if you are bleeding so badly that you're soaking a pad an hour, get to the ER. If not... I wouldn't call it an emergency and I would probably stop the patches. I am not a doctor though so I'm not sure. Maybe ask the nurses at your doctor's office?"
110si5k,"You're obviously trying to work within the system.  Excellent, but it's obviously failing you, so maybe try other options too?  You could get around The Systems' bullshit: if you're in the US, call Planned Parenthood or any local Trans healthcare clinic."
110si5k,I get my HRT from myalloy.com they have doctors who will help you. Did you dr. Also prescribe progesterone to protect your uterus? Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
110si5k,"This is exactly what is happening. I'm so angry! I've been his patient since I was in my early 20ies. I can't believe I'm being treated this way. All I need is to adjust the dosage ffs.
I'm sorry you had to go through that as well. Its unbelievable"
110si5k,"Yes, I realize that and I'm in the process of getting a new doctor. I'm just at a loss as to what to do until then."
110si5k,"Yes, you're so right! My new family doctor is so young, but he is an absolute sweetheart! He's eager and empathetic but also lacks confidence, and I'm just nervous about how knowledgeable he is on my issue. But I think I will make an apt to see him tomorrow. Thank you."
110si5k,"Until now, I was at 13 months without any bleeding. The patch I'm on is Estalis 140/50"
110si5k,I'm planning on it!!
110si5k,Nope! he didn't even though I  asked him several times and told him I was in pain.
110si5k,I think some doctors don‚Äôt want patients who advocate for themselves. Sounds like yours didn‚Äôt want to deal. We both deserve better. Good luck!
110si5k,Would you consider telehealth? I had a good experience with [Alpha](https://www.helloalpha.com).
110si5k,"I'm so sorry you are experiencing this. I currently have a 3 month wait to see a doctor. It was suggested to me by a friend to check out a women's clinic, like planned parenthood, they take a lot of insurance and if they don't take yours they have sliding scale. I'll be trying that this week. Best of luck."
110si5k,Find a place to review him online and then do it. Warn off other menopausal women.
110si5k,"If you're in the US, is Planned Parenthood an option?"
110si5k,I‚Äôve found young doctors aren‚Äôt afraid to look stuff up and usually have a laptop with them during the appointment.
110si5k,"I also think seeking help from your primary doc may be a great option. If he‚Äôs empathetic and advocates for you, he will probably be eager to figure out how to help you. My pcp will literally look things up / research while I‚Äôm in the office with her. It‚Äôs definitely worth giving it a shot to get some help! And he may also have a good recommendation / referral for a new gynecologist who can take over your care."
110si5k,"Any change in hormone dosages can cause a period, however seeing how you've gone more than 12 months, it's recommended you get it checked to rule out other potential causes.  Post-meno bleeding is likely due to hormones, but it's always best to confirm this.  

As others have suggested, you need a new doctor."
110si5k,I did do that!!
110si5k,"Yes. Planned Parenthood is a good option to get you started. I moved and (still) don't know where to go for support. So I started at Planned Parenthood. I got the patch and progesterone. I really pushed for more (HA, suppository, etc) because other symptoms but that is all this PA & office was willing to do. It's a start. In this state, my visit was not covered by insurance. Also, I didn't consent to a work up for this first visit. Could have impacted what they were willing to provide. 

I'm still at the beginning of my journey. So many questions but I'm glad I got a QoL breather for now. I'm not looking forward to the search for a regular provider. I have trauma around getting support for my medical concerns."
110si5k,I'm in Canada
110si5k,"Yes! This is so true - mine has literally told me ""I don't know"" during appointments and looks it up. I have absolutely no issue with that - I would rather that than someone who pretends to know something and leads us both down the wrong path."
110si5k,Thank you
110si5k,"Well, crap. There are some PP clinics in Canada, but maybe there are other clinics you can try? I'm sorry you're having to deal with this crap!"
10zxnz2,"I had this and it was scary, I thought I was having a heart attack.  The only reason I didn‚Äôt schedule a cardio apt was because I had a GYN appointment the next day and thought to ask her first.  My GYN told me it is common when estrogen and progesterone are out of balance.  She adjusted my prescription and it stopped."
10zxnz2,I have heart palpitations as a symptom of my Hoshimoto‚Äôs so to me it‚Äôs normal.  I feel like I just had a panic attack when it first happens.  I also got freaked out this week because my palpitation just randomly hits during the day.  Never realized that until I started wearing my Fitbit again.
10zxnz2,"I get this, especially after exerting myself. Supplementing potassium helps me.

But also I‚Äôd look into GERD, maybe start trying to see if there is an association between the symptoms and what you ate. It‚Äôd probably be bothering you at night too but wondering if maybe at lunch you eat some foods that trigger it."
10zxnz2,"Yes.

Cut my coffee intake in half (boo hoo.)  
Have pretty much quit eating sugar (boo hoo.)

And I take an adrenal relief supplement at night, which also helps me sleep. I was taking one with magnesium that worked really well but I was having daily diarrhea (I'm super sensitive to magnesium) so switched.

All these things have really helped! But stress can make it happen, as can sugar, caffeine, etc. when I am not perfect about my intake. It's very annoying but not as annoying as the palpatations."
10zxnz2,"I had them.  My cardiologist suspected it was probably hormonal but gave me the full work up just to be safe.  All tests were normal.  Since then,  I have started HRT and haven't had any flutters since then."
10zxnz2,Magnesium supplements 800mg stopped my heart palpitations. They are very paralyzing one feels like they cannot breath.
10zxnz2,I have them. Have seen 2 cardiologists in the past 3 years and nothing is wrong. I'm convinced it's hormone related and am starting HRT soon.
10zxnz2,"Oh my word, I had heart palpitations for the first time last night. It was horrible. Lying on the couch watching TV and they came out of nowhere. Was scary.

Can't believe we don't get told more about this stuff."
10zxnz2,How's your iron levels?
10zxnz2,"I have esophageal spasms, likely related to reflux. My Lyme doc told me about it years ago, and my reflux has been worse as of late. üòê"
10zxnz2,"I definitely had that during perimenopause! Mine was usually around bedtime, but it also popped up whenever it felt like it. Absolutely fucking terrifying!"
10zxnz2,"I have this but my cardiologist didn‚Äôt know what it was. I had so many tests and questions, all for heart disease. E.g., I had several stress tests but my symptoms did not appear. I was put on beta blockers and aspirin as ‚Äúpreventative‚Äù, but I think it is peri menopause because when I was given estrogen my symptoms fired up!  Also when the heart symptoms started so did my terrible heavy periods. No one will admit it though."
10zxnz2,"Sorry you're experiencing palpitations...I have them regularly and since menopause they have been more frequent. Mine are uncomfortable but doctors have said that in my case they arent dangerous..should have a doctor look over yours to be safe. Sometimes during palpitations, it helps to bear down (like you're on the toilet) for a couple of seconds or to blow into a straw for a few seconds which has a similar effect for me. I also take a beta blocker which seems to help. Best wishes to you!"
10zxnz2,"I've had palpitations since I was a kid, and the only thing that's helped is magnesium."
10zxnz2,"Do you also have indegestion issues? I experienced this with an H.Pylori infection and it was horrible. I also had pain in my upper back, left chest and left upper abdomen. I was treated with 2 weeks of intense antibiotics and PPIs and will retest for the infection in about a month to make sure it's gone."
10zxnz2,My sister in law had the same palpitations. She didn't use any treatments. They just stopped out of nowhere. She's hasn't changed anything in her lifestyle or diet . It was hormonal.
10zxnz2,"I had PVC‚Äôs but they increasing got worse and then I got Ventricular Tachycardia‚Äî shaking, delusions, it was so frightening. Third Cardiologist was amazing and I had an ablation. Still get light PVC‚Äôs for 2-3 days each month."
10zxnz2,I take magnesium twice a day and it stopped the palpitations I had for almost a year in two days.
10zxnz2,Absolutely!  I was scared and had no idea what was happening to me.
10zxnz2,I started having these alot when I hit post menopause. I believe it is hormonal but you should have it checked out by your doctor. Mine seemed related to anxiety. I'm on an antidepressant and they seem to have stopped. I can't take hrt.
10zxnz2,Have you had your thyroid levels checked?
10zxnz2,Ohhh thank you!!! I have a feeling this is hormone-related (isn't everything these days?) so this is reassuring.
10zxnz2,this - it sounds exactly like small esophageal spasms - your esophagus is right up on your heart so the two can be confusing. GERD can also be hormonal. Try to jot down every time it happens and see if you get a pattern (certain foods/movements/ more noticable day before period etc).
10zxnz2,"I have been experimenting with reducing caffeine and sugar but not noticing a difference in the pitter patter, not yet anyway."
10zxnz2,"Fyi, magnesium lotion is great. I rub some on my feet at bedtime to help with sleep, and since it's absorbed through the skin, no stomach issues."
10zxnz2,Chelated magnesium is the stuff to take that doesn't give you diarrhoea
10zxnz2,"Me too. Switched to decaf tea and coffee and the fluttering stopped. Never had any trouble before, but apparently now I can‚Äôt handle full caffeine."
10zxnz2,"Do you take a specific type of Mg‚Ä¶citrate, chloride, glycinate?"
10zxnz2,Had them so intensely last night I curled up against my sleeping husband so at least when I died (I was pretty sure that was going to happen) I'd be close to him.
10zxnz2,"Good, all my labs are fine, just had them done."
10zxnz2,"It‚Äôs a confusing and difficult time of life.  I‚Äôd be crazy without this sub! Glad I could finally help
Someone else out!"
10zxnz2,"When I was in my 20‚Äôs I went to the ER for what I thought was heart related. Test after test and what caused the discomfort was esophageal spasms.

Started in the front of the chest and radiated to the back, over and over. Back in the 1990‚Äôs they had a phone line called Ask a Nurse. I call and explain symptoms and she tells me it sounds like a heart attack. Thats when I went to the ER. Treatment was Prilosec (which  only available with prescription then) and a bland diet until it settled down."
10zxnz2,"Oh, great suggestion! Do you have a brand you like?"
10zxnz2,"Still does for me, unfortunately."
10zxnz2,"Citrate remains in the gut tube, used for bowel prep/constipation
Chloride salt is absorbed from gut but promotes free radicals.  Not my choice, ever.
Glycinate -would be the salt absorbed from gut to help with all body functions, including sleep, cardiac."
10zxnz2,Interesting.  I had the same symptoms which resolved with iron pills (as much as I hate taking them).
10zxnz2,I am so glad you posted this? Do you know how she adjust your prescription?
10zxnz2,"I really like Life-Flo (vanilla scent), and there's another one with lavender, but I can't remember the brand. A hot bath with Dr. Teal's epsom salt is nice, too. There's a lavender one for sleep, but my favorite is the one with ashwagandha called Calm Your Mind. Both are excellent ways to get magnesium, as is snacking on pepitas. :)"
10zxnz2,"She lowered my estrogen and increased progesterone.  It was in response to my specific levels after testing, so please don‚Äôt try to adjust any meds without your Dr checking first or you may make it worse."
10zxnz2,"Really curious how they are testing your hormones if you don't mind sharing. I feel like I see everyone in here always talking about how it's a waste to test hormones because they change so much, but I also feel like I don't understand how you know what you need if you aren't testing things. I'm new to this whole discussion, so I'm trying to get as much information as possible."
10zxnz2,"My doctor said that it looked like I was still making estrogen, so that plus the prescribed estrogen was too much in relation to the amount of progesterone.  So she decreased my estrogen and increased progesterone.  Not sure if that helps answer your question, but the heart palpitations went away a few days after the change in meds and they have mot come back."
10zxnz2,That is helpful! Thank you. Is it a saliva test that they do to determine your levels? Or are you saying that they were just going by symptoms?
10zxnz2,My GYN tests my blood every time.
10dbix6,Homicide.
10dbix6,That's a good one.
10dbix6,It‚Äôs not wrong
10dbix6,This made my morning...lol!
10dbix6,"This morning I had my first full-blown, acting-out rage, and ngl it scared me. I punched a wall, attempted to break a Topo Chico bottle (what are those things made of????), and screamed so hard my throat hurt. It was very difficult to stop myself from doing worse. Are we having fun yet?"
10dbix6,"Making memes is a really good way to bring ideas to the general public. This is such a good idea. Maybe should work on presenting our experiences this way.

Thank you for beginning it up."
10dbix6,Perfect.
10dbix6,I love this!
10dbix6,"I saw this recent interview with Viola Davis talking about it on Kimmel, she's NOT wrong and neither is the meme.  
https://youtu.be/7Uipsro4x4w?t=114"
10dbix6,"Yes üòÇ

Also Menopaws the silent meow ( it‚Äôs a book I saw years back but can‚Äôt find ) 
I have an image it being funny and have no idea how I retained the title"
10dbix6,Updoot for adorable angry kitty.
10dbix6,"They could be implying menopausal women are homophobic but more likely a typo designed to get engagement, as is the latest trend."
10dbix6,I didn‚Äôt even notice - which is unusual for me!  I guess I need my reading glasses‚Ä¶
10dbix6,"Well, the spelling is."
10dbix6,Google menopause memes and go nuts sharing them
10dbix6,"Whether it's a typo, a trend or an intolerance, they're all annoying !"
10dbix6,Yes‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even notice the misspelling.  Time for reading glasses.
10dbix6,Join the club!  I got funky cats-eye ones that I love.
1123ayu,"I can get like this from sativa, but indica is fine."
1123ayu,"I.smoked heavily and happily for many years until one day the sensatiions you're describing  happened to me. It happened during the hormonal shifts of postpartum for me. I continued to try for a while. But i gave up. I still  lament the loss of cannabis in my life, honestly, but i don't even try anymore even though it's more widely accepted now and it's legal. I've worked hard to estsblish better sleep hygiene. I have to pay close attention to my libido and my husband now that i'm in menopause. I find i am sensitive to medications and supplements now. Not necessarily panic, but undesireable effects."
1123ayu,"Oh my god, is this what happened to me??? I‚Äôve never had panic attacks before and I was always a heavy (daily) smoker. Something happened in my mid 30‚Äôs where I smoked and then I felt like a whoosh go through my body. Sweaty palms, tight chest, and thought I was having a heart attack! I‚Äôve even gone to the emergency room a couple of times because I thought I was dying! I stopped smoking years ago because it just wasn‚Äôt worth it anymore which really sucks because I enjoyed it immensely and now I live in a legal state."
1123ayu,Delta 8 THC gummies I can handle but actual edibles I can‚Äôt.   I cut them in half for pain relief or small bouts of insomnia and use full one when insomnia hits hard.
1123ayu,"This is what happened to me too, all I can say is I‚Äôm sorry, it really sucks. 

I had panic attacks when I was a teen and only experienced them again when I tried to smoke weed when I was starting peri. 

I‚Äôm super envious of those who can smoke because here I am most likely destroying my liver and increasing my cancer risk by drinking. :( I can‚Äôt get through all of this sober."
1123ayu,I happily smoked all through my teens and college but once I became an adult with a job and responsibilites that's exactly the effect weed had on me. I have now started using THC edibles exclusively as a sleep aid. I was waking up every night between 1 and 3 and could not fall back asleep - hot sweaty and miserable. Now I pop 5 mg and am able to settle back in till 7. I wake up without feeling any residual effects.
1123ayu,"For me, it's not linked to peri. I can remember a couple of times I had a panic attack in my early 20s due to high a dose or a certain strain. Same with edibles or other consumables (stay away from the drinks!) through my 30s. Frankly, some of the consumables are adulterated with other things Also, my good friend who had the same exact problem is a man.

That said, low estrogen can absolutely cause anxiety and panic attacks, so could be a confounding factor."
1123ayu,"This happened to me too but now I can smoke again. I started super slow. Maybe stay away from bong tokes since they get you super high, and just get a small bowel and take one small hit at a time. Also, maybe stay away from the sativa‚Äôs and stick to a predominantly indica strain because it calms you more. 

Delta 8 gummies tend to make me more anxious as well as thc gummies (I‚Äôm not sure why)."
1123ayu,It happened to me around age 20. Haven‚Äôt tried it since because I was so terrified. That was almost 40 years ago.
1123ayu,"Same. I‚Äôve tried edible and smoke. And each time I feel like I‚Äôm dying, panicking slipping through time. Ever since I‚Äôve hit peri I can‚Äôt touch the stuff anymore. Used to love the effects. Now just thinking about it makes me anxious."
1123ayu," I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having an issue but was glad to read that you have techniques to help you cope. I have routinely smoked weed since a teen and have never had an adverse effect. The issue I find now though is that nothing really gets me high. Edibles have never worked for me so that wasn‚Äôt a surprise, but green, thc oil, and even delta 8/9/10 vape pens were always my go to. I still try on occasion but the rage that sets in when I can‚Äôt get that head change isn‚Äôt worth it 
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs related to hormonal changes, or the Universe telling me to grow up lol
I‚Äôve never cared for alcohol and so I won‚Äôt pick that up as an alternative‚Ä¶sigh‚Ä¶guess it‚Äôs the sober life for me"
1123ayu,"Yep. 

Had to go into my friend's bathroom and sit on the cool tiles for about an hour.

Total panic attack worrying about everything I'd ever done, said...the works 

Was terrifying.

Never again"
1123ayu,What strain of cannabis are you using? Sativa can cause an increase in anxiety. Try an indica. Or an edible or drink.
1123ayu,"Me too. I used to enjoy weed but now it often triggers a panic attack. Oddly enough, it's especially bad I'd I smoke before taking a shower. I normally really enjoy showering and find it relaxing, but if I smoke first, I have an odd sensation like my whole body is swelling and about to explode."
1123ayu,"I used to smoke a little everyday after work to take the edge off, did that for years. I‚Äôve had that panicking feeling at times and noticed them intensifying in peri menopause.  I quit.  For three years.  Now I‚Äôm in post and started w gummies.  Meh.  Weed is legal where I live now and I went to local dispensary‚Äî they recommended strains that can help with anxiety and not make me sleepy. Game changer!  I‚Äôm smoking a strain now that is so nice and anxiety free.  I feel all happy and confident‚Äî really high and functional.  

Apples and Bananas üíØ"
1123ayu,"Yup.  I used to love it and since peri I can‚Äôt enjoy it anymore.  My anxiety levels have increased significantly so believe that certainly has something to do with it.  I have switched to CBD and although it doesn‚Äôt feel like anything, it really helps calm my anxiety and allows me to handle sever chronic pain much easier."
1123ayu,This happened to me once when having total of 200 mg infused drinks and smoking. Regular smoker for over 14 yrs. I realized I seriously over did it. Thought for sure I was having a heart attack. Ever since I've just stayed with smoking and avoid the edibles.
1123ayu,"I‚Äôve always had atypical responses to mj ‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs indica or sativa, it makes me wired, unable to sleep, and I lose my appetite. I buy one strain only for smoking that doesn‚Äôt spike my anxiety. It‚Äôs very uplifting and a great mood stabilizer, which I need, but I can never smoke before I want to/need to sleep and it probably makes my adhd (attention span aspects) worse. But man does it lift a bad mood. 


Weirdly, I don‚Äôt seem to have the same issues with edibles (or not as severe) but I live in a state where edibles are not part of the medicinal mj program. I can get quality ones elsewhere but honestly, I enjoy the act of smoking.

For OP, it might be the strain or it might be something shifted inside you that‚Äôs making you react this way. It sounds like a shitty situation and I hope you find a solution soon."
1123ayu,Delta 10 is all the good without the paranoia/anxiety for me.
1123ayu,I've heard a lot of people say that along with trying a more even blend of CBD and THC but I'm just not sure I have the will to try it again for awhile. We'll see I guess
1123ayu,"I'm sorry you've experienced similar things but thank you for sharing and relating. I've been doing the same with my sleep by avoiding coffee, getting morning sunlight in my eyes, etc and it's definitely helped with sleep and I think I'll be able to adjust back to a life without weed, just makes me very sad nonetheless. My libido is garbage and always has been and weed had it to where we were having sex every day if not multiple times a day, my husband could barely keep up with me for the first time in our 20+ year relationship."
1123ayu,"That's exactly how it felt for me. Sorry you've experienced it too, it really sucks."
1123ayu,"Do you get anxiety with regular gummies? And yes, the half I had of the Delta 8 was fine but I felt literally nothing, so I went ahead and had the other half over an hour later, and that's when it all set in again. I'm worried it's just my brain perceiving the feeling of being high as unsafe now."
1123ayu,I'm so sorry. I actually tried to have a drink last night to calm myself down but it made me feel like utter shit and I slept terrible. It's so freaking frustrating to have a body that just revolts at everything all of a sudden...
1123ayu,"And I've heard similar tales about anxiety and Delta 8. Delta 8 isnt sold in the dispensaries near me, and I've personally never tried it. Isn't there something slightly different in the formula from a ""traditional"" (can't think of a better word) THC?"
1123ayu,"Thanks exactly what I'm wondering - if the hormone changes are just exacerbating things. I've never had anxiety that causes a right chest and high heart rate until after that experience, and I definitely had much higher stress levels for seemingly no reason... Last year was the best year of my life regarding self acceptance/esteem after my ADHD diagnosis which is why this has all been so jarring. It's made me feel unsafe in my body again and I hate it. So I'm just trying to rationalize it so I can get back to that felt safety again."
1123ayu,Me too. I quit for 8 months after I had a panic attack. I had to start again real slow with small amounts.
1123ayu,"Yeah I don't blame you, that's how I feel as well"
1123ayu,"Ugh I'm so sorry, it truly feels so unfair."
1123ayu,"That's super interesting. I'm sorry it's not been working for you. Maybe a good 21 day t-break would help to get it out of your system and start ""from scratch"" again? Just an idea."
1123ayu,Ugh I'm so sorry. Was this after not having issues with weed in the past?
1123ayu,"Great question, I don't even remember at this point, I flushed what I had left because I didn't want to be tempted to try it again after I forget how terrible the panic attack was"
1123ayu,"I totally know what you're talking about! It's the craziest feeling, not fun at all."
1123ayu,"I'm really hoping I can find something eventually, but it might have to be awhile because it's a full 24 hours of anxiety every time I try and I just don't want to deal with that again, ugh."
1123ayu,"Yeah I think it was dosage the first time, but not sure why my body is still freaking out even with smaller amounts. Hopefully I can go back at some point..."
1123ayu,"Doesn't seem to matter for me, but I have debated trying strains with more CBD but not for awhile. I don't want to risk feeling like that again, it's really terrible."
1123ayu,"CBD definitely might help. There‚Äôs a sativa strain called Harlequin that‚Äôs good for me, and that has higher CBD.

Check out the Leafly app to research strains."
1123ayu,"2 things that have helped with libidio in the last couple of years were wellbutrin and nutrofol hair supplements. 
I stopped wellbutrin because of my ""medication sensitivity"" and i cant prove the nutrifol is the cause, but there seems to be an anectodal corrolation. I experienced very high peri libido before another shift in hormones created a much lower libido."
1123ayu,Edibles just make my head hurt‚Ä¶.like my brain cannot process fast enough what is happening so I end up sleeping.  Delta 8s I can function on better‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not to strong for me.
1123ayu,"Oh yeah definitely. But most of what I read is the fact that a lot of the current weed that you can buy is very high THC content with very little CBD, so I think if I go back eventually I might try something with a more even blend."
1123ayu,"I had a huge panic attack in July 2020 and thought I had covid and couldn't breathe. I got put on buspar for anxiety (highly recommended) but in retrospect believe it was perimenopause as the root cause. Once I got on HRT, I weaned off the buspar."
1123ayu,This gives me hope that maybe I can get back to it at some point!
1123ayu,"Yep. Completely out of the clear blue sky.

I still shudder thinking about it.

Even the smell of it now makes me pause ."
1123ayu,So sorry to hear‚Ä¶  menopause ü´§
1123ayu,"Oh man, I was able to find pre-rolls or something of Harle-Tsu when I was in California once and it was amazing... https://www.leafly.com/strains/harle-tsu"
1123ayu,"Trazodone is an antidepressant that is usually prescribed for sleep but it really can be a fantastic antidepressant AND it doesn't kill your sex life like most of them. In fact, it can cause an increase in libido. For men and sometimes women, it can cause priapism, but only at high doses. Then there is Persistant Genital Arousal syndrome. I developed this after starting Trazodone a few years ago. I was always aroused and  often had spontaneous orgasms. It was fun but distracting and sometimes unsafe. Like when it happened while I was driving."
1123ayu,Do you still take nutrafol and does it still have an effect on your libido?
1123ayu,Also try sticking to indica strains rather than sativa. I have found indica to be much less likely to cause anxiety.
1123ayu,"This is really helpful information, super appreciate it. I'm hoping to try and get hormones figured out before I go down the psychiatric medication route, but I'm open to everything at this point."
1123ayu,"I totally understand, when you have a response like that it is extremely jarring and sticks in your memory."
1123ayu,I take half  the dose every 2 or 3 days or so. I do think its better than it was before. I think i read in a difderent poat that some others also thought it was helping. Someone mentiined it might be the saw palmetto in nutrafol. Its $80 for 1 month supply if taken as directed.
10zxeu7,"I hit meno in my mid 20s, getting the lab results that prove you were right is such a good feeling! Glad you have the data to back you up now. Hope your doctors will listen more. And if not, find new doctors!"
10zxeu7,"A friend who is a family med doc suggested I use Everlywell to do my own labs. I was able to throw the results at my primary care physician and finally get a bone density test. Of course, I already have bone loss. I should have done it years earlier."
10zxeu7,Why wouldn‚Äôt they take your thyroid issues seriously without menopause? I‚Äôve had hypothyroidism since I was a teenager and a friend of mine first got diagnosed in 6th grade.
10zxeu7,Would you mind sharing what tests you had done? I am seeing my doctor on Monday and I am going to bring up Peri and ask for some tests! (thank you!)
10zxeu7,"I work in medicine and I can say that Women‚Äôs Health is poorly understood and there is too much ‚Äòoh don‚Äôt worry about your fine‚Äô! And you have symptoms of thyroid problems befire theybrven show up in your blood tests. And this is not just a problem if you see make Drs. a lot of female Drs also gave their heads buried in the sand. Just as supplement thyroid disease with thyroxine why then is HRT so stigmatised? I remember in the year 2000 when I had just started wirk in Pharmaceutucays and my first portfolio was Women‚Äôs Health, there was a huge HRT trial of something like 5,000 women and 1 lady passed away with breast cancer. They stopped the trial and HRT was outlawed and they claimed it caused breast cancer. Ok but how manywomen who have not had HRT have also died of breast cancer and the Drs who caused the most problems were men. A lady I know in her 60s fell over while walking ahd broke her hip fairly recently. Her Dr said you have severe osteoporosis and it‚Äôs because you did not use HRT. She recovers ahd then she was diagnosed with breast cancer, keep in mind here she never had HRT. If you feel your Dr is not listening to you aud you have concerns I urge you to find another Dr"
10zxeu7,I went into it at 23. Do you by chance have Ehlers danlos syndrome?
10zxeu7,Interesting. I have it and it seems to me that menopause happens early to us but we have no studies on it.
10zxeu7,I‚Äôve been thinking about doing that as well- I‚Äôm glad to know it went well. Def something to think about!
10zxeu7,"Also hypothyroid since age 14-15, diagnosed finally at 19. They said another month untreated I might have died. Resting heart rate was 29bpm, classic delayed reflex response. So at that point they finally figured it out. Not anything else I told them before that. Unexplained weight gain? You must be sneaking food. Tired all the time? Lazy teenager. Brain fog? Probably drugs. Doctors suck. Oh and I am also a short german, obvs not the short german :)"
10zxeu7,It‚Äôs actually bananas. I have legions on my thyroid and have all of the typical issues for at least 5; I have had two ultrasounds in 3 years and they basically say ‚Äúeh it‚Äôs ok- don‚Äôt worry that you can‚Äôt swallow and have this this this oh and this wrong. It‚Äôs completely typical to gain 100lbs (at this point) in 5 years- you‚Äôre just not watching your ratios. Oh your nails? Don‚Äôt open bags of things and they won‚Äôt split-‚Äú Fricking maddening!
10zxeu7,"DHEA-S, Estradiol, FSH, LH (luteinizing hormone), Progesterone, Prolactin, TSH with reflex to FT4, Vit D full panel, A1-C.

I hope this is helpful!"
10zxeu7,I‚Äôve wondered if I have it. No diagnosis though.
10zxeu7,"Yes! I do- that too took ages to actually ‚Äòdiagnose‚Äô even though I have the typical physical markers. Getting a full genetic screen this year hopefully. 

My hysto was basically due to EDS (though not diag at the time)."
10zxeu7,This comment right here.
10zxeu7,"I wish I had known to get the baseline blood work and bone density before or at least during peri. I was fully menopausal but bc I was on the pill with no period it went under the radar. Since then, when they push back on tests I want, I call their bluff and tell them I will pay for it if my insurance doesn't cover it. So far, it has."
10zxeu7,I've had anorexia forever so no one ever even considered that my hair breaking or my extreme exhaustion and cold intolerance was thyroid issues until I recovered. I'm still very very thin and so I had to advocate for myself to even medicated at all.
10zxeu7,This is also why I‚Äôm fighting- trying to not let my kiddo go through decades without care. Their doctor actually wanted to put them on a weight loss injection without doing labs for thyroid first. Nope.
10zxeu7,100 lbs of weight gain is not attributable to thyroid issues. It accounts for a small decrease in expenditure and around a 15 lb weight gain.
10zxeu7,Is there a reason you are doing a full screen?
10zxeu7,"That‚Äôs crazy, so glad you told them no. It‚Äôs sad you have to make them do what they should have suggested in the first place."
10zxeu7,"It will help my children with getting their diagnosis sooner- hopefully. We also have a familial endocrine issue that no one is taking seriously and the hope is that myself and my aunt (who has had exact same symptoms) and my youngest daughter all hit with a similar/same sequencing. 

For those curious- I am not type one, but have had hypoglycemia my entire life and as of 8 years ago began noticing something similar to Sunrise syndrome (super high glucose reading) that would level out to normal within an hour of waking (then start hypoglycemic cycle). They, so far, do not have this issue it is singular to me."
10zxeu7,"Just so you know, there is no genetic screening for HEDS."
10zxeu7,Thanks for mentioning! It‚Äôs important knowledge.
10zxeu7,"If you are serious about testing, it‚Äôs not a genetic test, but you can go to Mayo Clinic in either Minnesota or Florida and undergo a skin removal typically on the arm that will take a large piece (around 1 square inch) from you and have it tested under a microscope, though it‚Äôs a very invasive test, and won‚Äôt tell you anything about your children beside that they may have it or be carriers since it‚Äôs genetic if you are found to have it. I opted out because I‚Äôm childfree and don‚Äôt I have to worry about my genetics and have all the symptoms. It will only tell you about your genetics."
10zxeu7,It‚Äôs if they are possible carriers and I‚Äôm going to look into it. I really appreciate it.
10yw9v8,Oh yes!!! And trouble opening jars!!
10yw9v8,Have they given any explanation for the lesions? Strokes? MS?
10yw9v8,"I developed carpal nearly instantaneously upon entering menopause.  My orthopedist said hormonal changes can induce carpal tunnel, but specifically thyroid and diabetes.  

Might be worth an orthopedist consult."
10yw9v8,My right hand cannot stay fully closed or grip things very tightly.  When that happens I use KT tape for a few weeks and it gets better.  I did ask my orthopedic why and he said because I broke it twice as a child my tendons weakened quicker in that hand as a result.
10yw9v8,"I notice this when Im hungry/ have low blood sugar. 

I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the MRI results. I know it‚Äôs hard to wait for more information. I‚Äôd consider seeing an acupuncturist that specializes in neurological conditions- often they do scalp acupuncture, but not always. Starting this could slow/ decrease symptoms from progressing, especially if you start early."
10yw9v8,"Yes! Things like dropping my keys multiple times in a row, or dropping a box in the grocery store over and over again. I wondered briefly if there was a medical cause but then decided it was due to being distracted and trying to do too many things at once. It doesn't happen all the time."
10yw9v8,"Yes yes! Omg yes, I‚Äôm a bumbling drop everything hot mess."
10yw9v8,"Yes. 

I think my strength issues are related to iron deficiency anemia."
10yw9v8,"To all of you experiencing grip issues, please also consult with your dr regarding thoracic outlet syndrome.  Incredibly difficult to diagnose (took me 26 years of drs telling me that being able to literally stop my pulse was a cool party trick or all in my head). I finally found a GP that said that was NOT normal.  I was incorrectly diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, which can in fact cause sever muscle weakness.  I dropped everything I touched.  I couldn‚Äôt grip, couldn‚Äôt trust myself with a damn thing.  A nerve specialist ALSO diagnosed it as thoracic outlet syndrome. 
I was finally referred to a vascular surgeon.  I had 100% compression of nerve, arteries and veins.  My nerve that runs the whole arm was crushed in between my collar bone and 1st rib.  I want SO badly to spread the word.  Women are so often misdiagnosed.  Fight for an answer.  Dropping everything is not normal - no matter how much brain fog and shit we‚Äôre dealing with as peri menopausal or menopausal.  
All the best to you OP and keep fighting for answers.  X"
10yw9v8,"Yes, especially when I am tired. General clumsiness and lots of broken dishes!"
10yw9v8,"Yes!! Add that to the growing list of ""I didn't know that was a symptom of menopause"". I find it most in my thumbs and particularly when I wake up in the morning. Was worried I was getting rheumatoid arthritis or similar."
10yw9v8,"yup, Im strong af as long as I dont have to do anything with my hands"
10yw9v8,"Oh yes this is a big one. Has made me realize how a lot of packaging is incredibly able-ist, thinking of the elderly"
10yw9v8,"Honestly, I think it‚Äôs all hormone related"
10yw9v8,I just ordered a jar opener on Amazon.  I was struggling with a jar of spaghetti sauce and I couldn't believe how much it took to get it opened.
10yw9v8,"My dr said 'it's not definitively MS' but it's a long wait for another MRI to confirm, so it could be :( Waiting on the next MRI now."
10yw9v8,"I'm not familiar with KT tape, I'll look that up. Thanks!"
10yw9v8,"Ha, I am a huge acupuncture fan! I mentioned the MRI to my practitioner and I wondered why he did my scalp during that treatment. I thought it was because I'd also mentioned hair loss üòÜ That's good to know!"
10yw9v8,Me too with the keys! And soap and my razor in the shower. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind
10yw9v8,Oh I hate that so much! The keys at the front door.
10yw9v8,"That's interesting, I'm not sure I've had my iron tested lately."
10yw9v8,"Thanks for sharing that, wow I'd never heard of that. I thought carpal tunnel was a repetitive strain thing, I'd never had pain so never thought of that. It seems like such a little annoying thing that I haven't even mentioned it to my GP yet. Hope you were able to access the correct treatment."
10yw9v8,"Ah yes, it makes sense it'd be worse when tired, I wasn't really paying attention to that.  Pretty much always tired."
10yw9v8,"Yeah, given there are studies available on NONE of these things, I guess we're pretty much down to crowdsourcing üòÜ Curious how widespread this is."
10yw9v8,In my case I really hope so.
10yw9v8,That exists?? I need that!
10yw9v8,The worry between tests can be excruciating. I hope everything turns out okay.
10yw9v8,"Ha! That‚Äôs awesome. I use points on the scalp a lot, but ‚Äòscalp acupuncture‚Äô  is a system where these lines or areas are carefully measured and needle stimulation can be heavier than ‚Äònormal.‚Äô It may be different than what your practitioner is doing. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre communicating with them what‚Äôs going on so they can help. Good luck!"
10yw9v8,Check that and your ferritin (iron storage) levels. üòä
10yw9v8,"I did not have any pain in my wrist either so I was dubious.  Bought the brace, did as I was told.  My shoulder was always very sore though.  Yes, I got treatment which absolutely sucked.  They cut out my rib and neck muscle to make room for the nerve and artery.  My grip is back, I don‚Äôt drop everything.  I have veins in my hand again.  üëèüëèüëèLots of nerve damage though so it‚Äôs not been easy.  At least I won‚Äôt get DVT in my arm and lose all my grip.  Getting stronger every week.  ü§û"
10yw9v8,"I then remembered when I was pregnant how butterfingers I was, it's like a slight swelling ... hormones love to mess with us, don't they? See also: darker eyelids."
10yw9v8,Yes. Thank you. Felt like a bit of a gut punch!
10yw9v8,"Huh. I'll look into that, thank you!"
10yw9v8,Yikes that sounds really awful. Glad the worst is behind you and you're feeling so much better!
111qrr9,"I get cold flashes a few times per day now, along with 15+ hot flashes. The cold flashes are just absolutely bone-chillingly painfully cold!"
111qrr9,"I went through a period of hot flashes/sweats, followed by chills. It is hell and I am sorry for you. I also had dizziness and nausea thrown in for good measure."
111qrr9,"I'm thinking yeah. I get chills, just no particular time of day"
111qrr9,Yes I randomly get these
111qrr9,I have a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù temperature gauge according to my family.  Cold intolerance = always cold and it‚Äôs a symptom of my thyroid condition.
111qrr9,I used to get cold flashes. Hot showers never helped. Saw a TCM (traditional Chinese medicine practitioner) who performs Arvigo massages which heals energy and stuff and I don't get them anymore. Took > 6 months of sessions at 2 times a month. I can sleep naked again! Vs in sweats under a thick duvet.
111qrr9,"Yeah, cold flashes are a thing."
111qrr9,I'd get your iron levels and thyroid checked just to be sure. I used to get really cold after lunch and I had super-low iron.
111qrr9,I've had some hot flashes but I'm cold more frequently than hot and often get chills.   Some nights I'll wake up shivering and have to take a hot shower to warm up.
111qrr9,"Definitely. Once I stopped drinking alcohol my hot flashes lessened a lot but now I get really cold on my face, hands and feet/toes every night."
111qrr9,"Yes, occasionally.  I have a friend who is constantly cold, and she‚Äôs around 48 yoa."
111qrr9,"It doesn't matter how many layers I wear, it's like my body is being controlled from right inside my bones by an ice furnace. I keep thinking that I'm getting flu. I shake uncontrollably. My skin temperature feels slightly above normal."
111qrr9,Every day at 5pm! Like clockwork.
111qrr9,Hot flashes and chills all day for me. It‚Äôs exhausting üòï
111qrr9,Yes I do! Esp at night. No hot flushes though.
111qrr9,I get cold for about a week and a half every month.
111qrr9,I get tingly chills on my thighs with goosebumps that move up into my arms. And then sometimes I just feel cold and clammy. One time I had a cold flash that turned into a hot flash.  That was fun üò¨
111qrr9,Me too.  Hot flashes off and on all day.  And then chills all late afternoon/evening.
111qrr9,"Yes, mostly after breakfast. I spend most mornings wrapped up in blankets and jackets. So weird."
111qrr9,Is it the lowering of blood pressure? I do remember this during my period.
111qrr9,"I think I can tell the day I ovulate (I‚Äôm still peri) as for the last 4 months now, once a month I get a sudden drop in blood sugar followed by a hot flash period then gross sweaty chills, this lasts about an hour, usually late afternoon, and is an utterly miserable experience."
111qrr9,Wow I do get this often and never knew it was yet another hormonal thing. I smoked a little thc on friday night and got some of the worst chills i've had in ages!
111qrr9,Yes!! I am drinking soooo much tea just to warm my bones
111qrr9,"This is me currently. With mood swings, suicidal thoughts and apathy in the mix too! Gosh, how I love being a woman"
111qrr9,this. ugh
111qrr9,Interesting! Is it triggered by something you eat or drink?
111qrr9,"My mom (who was not a really good mom by any standards) told me women have ""the curse."" I always thought she meant periods, but I would take continuing periods for the rest of my life without having to think twice if it meant I didn't have to go through this fresh hell. And I had terrible pms. Honestly, the mental stuff has been the worst part for me- at least with periods, the pms wasn't permanent, which is what I fear about my fatigue, apathy, and brain fog."
10kuref,I don‚Äôt get the night sweats and the hot flashes thanks to low dose birth control. But I get the disrupted sleep. And it sucks.
10kuref,This is so cool.  Glad you posted it.  I have read probably more white papers than my doctor at this point!  So fascinating.  I am definitely affected in this way - my circadian rhythms are super messed up now.   I have hope that I can train my brain back to sleeping normally but it is hard going for sure.   I train owls and if it works on them to make them diurnal it can work on me!
10kuref,Progesterone 200mg did a hell of a lot for me with these issues.
10kuref,"The other night I didn‚Äôt take my cannabis edible because I had only gotten 4 hrs sleep the night before after being out late (not due to hormones) I figured I was tired enough I didn‚Äôt need the thc, forgetting that the thc is to prevent the nightmares. So of course I had nightmares all night long stressing me out and woke up covered in sweat

I think my night sweats are from the nightmares. Didn‚Äôt happen last night when I did take my edible. No nightmares, no sweats"
10kuref,"OP Progesteron has a more drastic effect on sleep quality than estrogen.

That‚Äòs because it is converted to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopregnanolone , a neurosteroid.


That‚Äòs also why birth control with synthetic Gestagens does not usually fully fix sleep issues in menopause. Because those Gestagens get metabolized totally differently, and you‚Äòll still lack allopregnanolone."
10kuref,"Somewhat related, would you ladies consider sleep disruption as one of the first signs of peri? I‚Äôm 39 and for the last year or so, especially the week before my period, I‚Äôm awake at 3 and it takes me forever to get back to sleep."
10kuref,ugh me here with you unable to sleep either
10kuref,"Hope you get some. FWIW, when I mentioned to my gyno that I was sleeping better (after almost a year of 3 am wake ups), she said, yep, that's the progesterone."
10kuref,"I was gonna ask if you have ADHD and then saw your username. ;) I too, have been up in the wee hours before, pondering about SCN and having epiphanies about hormones, neurotransmitters and circadian rhythms."
10kuref,I‚Äôve found from my Fitbit sleep score that the combo of low dose melatonin and delta 8 (a mmj cousin) is really good for my REM and deep sleep.
10kuref,My dr is recommending Trazadone to help me sleep while I wait for the estradiol to start working. Anyone have experience with these options? I‚Äôm waking up 4 or 5 times every night and totally losing my mind. I‚Äôve had an iud for years so I didn‚Äôt know I was in menopause until I stopped sleeping and my dr checked my hormone levels a week ago. I‚Äôm so desperate that I‚Äôll try anything at this point.
10kuref,Just want to reinforce what others have said: progesterone! Definitely discuss with your provider.
10kuref,To add to your research-- I discovered that the insomnia I have had is likely related to histamine intolerance. Check out histamine effect on circadian rhythm and peak histamine times.
10kuref,I was doses up to 200 mg progesterone and still not sleepin so I stopped it.  I now take micro doses melatonin and I just started on Zensleep eith5-htp by allergyresearch group. First 2 nights I slept 6 hours straight!!  Longest I've sleep in a year.so praying it keeps helping.
10kuref,I haven‚Äôt slept one good night in the past 2.5 years of peri. My dr finally let me start hrt 3 weeks ago and even though it‚Äôs a v low dose it has helped my hot flushes. Still wide wide wide awake and exhausted and hoping the hrt with either time or a higher dose can finally address my insomnia.
10kuref,üëèüëèüôåüôå
10kuref,What bc pill are you on?
10kuref, I love that you train owls.  I absolutely love owls.
10kuref,"If it works, let us know your tips!"
10kuref,I wished it worked for me. Sleep still shit but no hot flashes.
10kuref,It also didn't help me sleep .did reduce anxiety.
10kuref,I am another one that hasn‚Äôt been helped by progesterone. Thinking of asking to try estrogen to see if that makes a difference.
10kuref,Edibles have been a godsend for sleep.
10kuref,[deleted]
10kuref,Interesting. Thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm just about to start low dose BC. Any thoughts on the best way to ensure progesterone supplementing? My ob/gyn doesn‚Äôt seem very up to date on perimenopause ‚Ä¶.
10kuref,Thanks for this. It does not surprise me one bit that there are multiple hormones involved in our sleep.
10kuref,"Also just a quick skim on google, and it impacts GABA receptors... So that is where the anxiety comes from, huh? (again, unlikely one hormone or system at play, just frustrated by this)"
10kuref,[deleted]
10kuref,"Yes. I'm 54 & been having trouble sleeping since I was 40, even though I had regular periods until a year ago."
10kuref,Definitely
10kuref,"lol yes, we are legion. A very well read, overtired, distracted legion."
10kuref,"Interesting. I use Oura for sleep tracking, and part of the reason I joined this sub is I noticed my temperature went from being a nice sine wave over the course of a month to wacky patterns starting in September. From at least November onwards, my sleep has been terrible, with a lot of 3am waking. I've had insomnia before so didn't think much of it, but even ambien wouldn't help this time.

In addition to the temperatures no longer forming a normal pattern, my heart rate doesn't lower and my heart rate variability is super low (not great) when I sleep. But those figures were better when I was sick, so I've gone back to trying diphenhydramine (Zzzquil), and those numbers are way better."
10kuref,"Hi! I take Trazodone. It‚Äôs really rather innocuous‚Äîit‚Äôs an old antidepressant that, in much lower doses, can aid in sleep onset and/or falling back asleep. I would personally rank it as one of the most harmless sleep aids you can take? 

It doesn‚Äôt work for everyone‚ÄîI feel like if it‚Äôs not a good fit, hydroxyzine is another good one to try [conversely, this one does not work for me]‚Äîand it can make you feel groggy and/or dry in your nasal passages + your mouth in the morning IF you take too much, but it is generally pretty forgiving. 

I would start lower, at 25 to 50 mg, to see how you tolerate it, and then increase as needed. At most I take 100 mg to maybe 125, but that is generally when I am having a hard time sleeping or take an additional amount in the middle of the night [which is also okay to do, although I always take less than I do at the start of the night, for obvious reasons]. But when I‚Äôm in a good sleep groove, I take between 50 + 75 mg each night and have for years! 

Good luck + remember, it‚Äôs just a trial! If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, no love lost. You can stop taking it at any time; you don‚Äôt need to titrate down unless you want to. üôÇ

[edited for typos]"
10kuref,"Yup, I am just starting my hormone journey so we'll see what doc says. But its extra hard because I've always had sleep rhythm problems, they're just out of control now!!"
10kuref,Yes! I am really thinking this is my problem too! Any advice on how to navigate this?
10kuref,It‚Äôs a low dose combination pill. I‚Äôm in Australia so I‚Äôm not sure if the brand would help you.
10kuref,Cute but crazy
10kuref,It definitely stops the nightmares so I‚Äôll take it
10kuref,"Ugh can you find a doc who is? It‚Äôs hard to find a doc who really knows much about this, I know."
10kuref,"Yea lack of progesterone (which is also produced basically not at all in menopause) is also involved in anxiety.

Though yea it‚Äòs a mixture. Lack of estrogen and testosterone will also increase anxiety, probably all through various different means/"
10kuref,What you describe is EXACTLY how it went for me too.  1 or 2 bad nights at pms time expanded over the course of a year until it was the whole month.
10kuref,I‚Äôm grateful for your experience and knowledge.  Thank you for sharing.  That‚Äôs what I was afraid of.  May good night sleep find you someday soon <3
10kuref,Thank you.  My mom had serious sleep issues for years.  Unfortunately she passed away suddenly (flu) a couple years back and I never got to pick her brain enough on the subject.  She had a pretty rough go with the process‚Ä¶.
10kuref,"My husband discovered that alcohol elevated his sleeping heart rate and since he's decreased his use he sleeps much better.  Also, his heart rate variability definitely gets worse right before he has a cold. 

I've been thinking about getting the Oura ring because my brother says it gives assessments and suggestions as opposed to the Fitbit which just gives me data that I have to interpret...

Do you like yourr Oura ring?"
10kuref,Thank you so much. This is such great helpful information!
10kuref,"There are lots of things to try for reducing histamine. I'm on a low histamine diet (I have known food triggers and migraine), I take an H1 and H2 antihistamine (loritadine during the day and hydroxyzine at night). I am on quercetin and vitamin C (no citrus or citric acid) for mast cell stabilization. My sleep is actually good now. You can check out histamine intolerance and MCAS for more info."
10kuref,You or the owls?
10kuref,[deleted]
10kuref,There are links in the wiki to lists of menopause doctors in a few countries. I was so pleased to find one at the clinic that I'm already at.
10kuref,Thanks. I loved my practice but they told me I didn‚Äôt need vaginal cream if I‚Äôm also using BCP. I know both help for vaginal atrophy so I didn‚Äôt argue. I‚Äôm on the lookout and am also considering one of those specialized telehealth services.
10kuref,"Yup, me too exactly. Started with insomnia just the few days before my period, then the whole week before, and now every night. I am currently at a year and a half of insomnia almost every dam night despite exercising everyday outside for an hour to two hours, morning light, no caffeine after 10am including chocolate, good diet, dark comfortable room, oral progesterone (even up it to 200 to see if that would help), an infinite amount of supplements, even some prescription meds stopped working."
10kuref,"I bought the old gen 2 used because it doesn't require a subscription. I haven't had a fitbit in a long time, so I don't know how the data differs, but I'm sure there's a comparison online. I only use it for sleep tracking because I have an apple watch but don't like to wear it at night. I get temperature, HR, HRV, and sleep data from Oura that I assume is roughly the same as fitbit. Oura gives you a sleep score and a readiness score (based on sleep, HR, HRV, and temp).

Personally, I find the suggestions dumb. ""You didn't sleep well, so don't take naps or eat too close to bedtime."" Well, I didn't do either of those things, and there's no way to tell it that it's wrong. I struggle with good sleep, like many of the women here, and it frequently says I was asleep when I know I was wide awake. The data is nice, but I don't know that it's any better than what you already have.

My husband got a gen 3 Oura but his subscription just expired, and now he gets almost no info. He decided to stick with his Apple Watch instead."
10kuref,"I use trazadone and agree with middles, it seems to work decently, I started to use it last summer whenI had really bad bout of insomnia before I got on HRT. I try not to use it too often. My sleep is not great and I do often wake up after 5 or 6 hours and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. I have tried to do lol the right things , including mediation , but sometimes I just want a good 8 or 9 hours of sleep so I take a trazadone to get it."
10kuref,Thank you! I have noticed H1 and H2 antihistamines are the only thing that help with my sleep which is why I am thinking I may have histamine issues. I know they tend to make everyone sleepy but things like Trazodone don‚Äôt help me sleep while taking something like Pepcid (H2) and Zyrtec do help me sleep (sometimes) even though they aren‚Äôt supposed to cause drowsiness.
10kuref,Yes
10kuref,Lol
10kuref,Lol. Absolute rubbish. Sorry. I know you mean well but I have the nightmares due to perimenopause. I used to only Have them during PmS but now they are constant and the ONLY way I get decent sleep is with thc. I have tried everything including heavy duty pharmaceuticals like ambien and lunesta which gave me horrible reactions. Never again. I will stick to natural thc
10kuref,"I mean yea that‚Äôs not necessarily wrong, oral estrogen will likely prevent or at least reduce vaginal atrophy, in the latter case you might still need some though. But simpler to first try oral and then add to that.


I‚Äôd really just ask about getting a prescription for 100-200mg of Progesterone next time you are there to improve sleep quality.


Thing is, that‚Äòs why BC isn‚Äôt a very good idea, you now got both the synthetic gestagen plus the real progesterone in your blood stream: which imo should be avoided simply for risking side effects."
10kuref,That‚Äôs interesting. So you‚Äôre saying no BPC with estrogen at all?
10kuref,"Nah it depends, plus often birth control is the only hormones you will be given access to, which is better than nothing.

But for nightly anxiety/restlessness/waking up not caused by a hotf√∂ash, regular hormonal birth control likely won‚Äòt touch those symptoms.


Birth control pills only work if grouch their estrogen-derivative contents, the gestagen really doesn‚Äòt do much, because it‚Äòs progesterones metabolites that age more important than progesterone itself for mental well being."
10k5i93,"Early in my perimenopause I went through a phase like you‚Äôre describing. The explanation I was told was basically that the testosterone was relatively higher than my dropping/variable estrogen, hence its prominent effects! Enjoy this time with your hubby. It‚Äôs one of the rare good parts of the meno journey."
10k5i93,Hate to say this but I a little jealous.  My husband and I are working together to figure out this whole low libido thing right now.    As for brain fog‚Ä¶..unless I am concentrating on something I daze out and my memory is crap.   Thankfully I have my lists and family to keep me on track.
10k5i93,It‚Äôs the last big hurrah! Enjoy it while it lasts.
10k5i93,"I went through that stage a couple of years ago, like everyone else says, enjoy it while it lasts. Now I'm left with zero libido and a husband who thinks if he can't have sex it's the end of everything. He's even taken to looking on online dating sites, which he thinks is acceptable because he's not interacting with anyone, just looking. I'm devastated and don't know where to turn."
10k5i93,I call it the ‚Äúextinction burst‚Äù LOL IYKYK
10k5i93,"I started testosterone and estring about a year ago after going to endocrinology for hot flashes. Hot flashes are almost completely gone, energy is better, and my libido and sensation came back full force, maybe extra. It‚Äôs awesome, happy for you üòú"
10k5i93,"Between the ages of 38 and 42 I was like,  a sex machine. Then, like a switch was flipped, NADA. Enjoy your second spring."
10k5i93,"Same girl, but I‚Äôm 60.  I‚Äôm wearing my husband out!"
10k5i93,This thread makes me feel dead inside. My libido is just gone. Nothing has helped.
10k5i93,You are right. This needs to be talked about much more.
10k5i93,"I'm 50 now.  When I was 43 I got a huge crush on a younger man.  Is this a typical thing?  Always wanted to take a poll about this!

Also, I think there should be some type of orientation when you hit 40 about what to expect/look out for/basic maintenance...etc."
10k5i93,I've always had a high libido but since last year I've been like a horny 13yr old boy. My Husband literally can't keep up. I'm 45 now and wondering how long this will last. I hope it doesn't just drop off a Cliff when I hit full Menopause because that would be horrible.
10k5i93,Me too!! Diagnosed at 39‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 48 now. I literally pulled up to a red light and then could figure out how to get from A to B!! I thought I had lost it!! Hormones do crazy thingsü§™
10k5i93,"Shit, I say enjoy it while it lasts! Get yours, sister!"
10k5i93,For me was also the mental component of sex for enjoyment/no more children.
10k5i93,"Yep, I remember that."
10k5i93,"I think if I had that briefly it was extinguished by HRT, the thing is I wasn't even sleeping at all when I made the decision to take HRT, I would go several nights in a row without sleep, so .... yea."
10k5i93,I was insatiable right before peri hit- at 40/41. It was awesome! I hope it comes back
10k5i93,Just finding out what it was did that‚Ä¶?!
10k5i93,"I‚Äôm right there with you.  Just starting peri and I think my partner wants to murder me.  I want sex every single day‚Ä¶and I get so mad if he is not in the mood.  Lol, I‚Äôm enjoying it while it lasts."
10k5i93,"Thank you, there seems to be a lot of crap parts at this stage in a woman's life, this, I am going to enjoy"
10k5i93,Ten years into menopause here and I haven't noticed any change in my libido.
10k5i93,I did as well.  The first three years or so for me.
10k5i93,"Yes, I've taken to writing everything down on a calendar, never have I ever had to do this before. Whu is it not talked about more?"
10k5i93,"I will, thank you. Really wish it was all talked about more"
10k5i93,"I‚Äôm so sorry. I went through super a low libido phase and changed up our dynamic so my husband doesn‚Äôt look for sex from me‚Äî he offers to give me pleasure. It‚Äôs a subtle but huge difference that shifted me from feeling like I was on the giving side to being on the receiving side. 

I‚Äôve since started HRT and the difference is night and day, but we still both focus on my pleasure. His comes organically as a result."
10k5i93,"Oh, you poor love. I really doubt that he's ""just looking"". I'd get an STI screening and start thinking seriously about what would mean the relationship is over for you."
10k5i93,"I'm so sorry, this breaks my heart for you. Its such a shitty thing to go through and it feels like womens health right now is not taken seriously. Wishing you the best"
10k5i93,"> I'm devastated and don't know where to turn.

A divorce lawyer.

He's not just looking. Even if he was, that is such a breach of trust. You can talk about it, figure it out, decide to open up the marriage, or decide not and to figure out how to have intimacy and meet each others needs with out him looking at other women he's imaging he wants to fuck. 

I am sorry, but your man is ridiculous. Fix your libido, but not for that toad."
10k5i93,"So he thinks it's okay to ignore your concern, full you with fear, minimize what he's doing all because you have a medical situation that has shifted your libido? How entitled and honestly mean. He is not owed sex."
10k5i93,Get on hrt‚Ä¶.
10k5i93,"He‚Äôs not owed sex, but it‚Äôs kind of a tricky situation to ask someone who is still fairly young to be celibate for the rest of their life.  I don‚Äôt think I could agree to it if my husband asked it of me.  Maybe you could figure out a way to get your libido up. It seems a lot of women have had luck with the right combination of things."
10k5i93,"Mind if I ask how long it took for sensation to come back? I have been on it for a week or so, and noticing significant improvement but I just have a feeling that the first part comes back quickly, but the rest will take time. No reason I think that other than I do?"
10k5i93,How is the testosterone administered?  Are you also taking estrogen?
10k5i93,You‚Äôve intrigued me consider endocrinology again. I stopped making appointments with mine as my internist knew as much for my thyroid with same test and Rx year after year. My internist is a few years older so she‚Äôs personally experienced this chapter in a women‚Äôs life. My GYN is same age but blah about it. I have always had a very active marriage and have taken the shots before and they were helpful. The office visits were often and the out of pocket costs were a turn off.  I switched from combo pill to the estradiol patch and it seems to be working. The dry skin and fatigue could improve. I‚Äôve had oily skin all my life so this is hello! It‚Äôs an educational balancing act and more time has to be taken for self care.
10k5i93,"Gah, same here, almost the exact age. Maybe 43-ish, and it makes me sad. I still like it a lot but that horny, hungry beast is much more subdued and needs a reason to come out."
10k5i93,Good to know this continues‚Ä¶
10k5i93,I believe that we will make it better for the next generation.  Such a shame how little it is talked about.
10k5i93,I‚Äôm 70 and want sex all the time‚Ä¶unfortunately husband doesn‚Äôt now‚Ä¶can‚Äôt win
10k5i93,"I think I'm already at the stage of thinking it's over, just need to get my head around it and plan for my future again. This is my second marriage, we've only been together 4 years and married for just over 12 months. I thought it was different this time, how wrong can you be."
10k5i93,"Thank you, you're right, it is a shitty thing to go through. Wishing you the best too, hope your relationship continues as it is and not like mine."
10k5i93,I can only imagine what this is doing to your self esteem. I doubt this is going to get better for you. I‚Äôm so sorry.
10k5i93,I noticed a difference within the first week but it maybe took a month to get super noticeable.
10k5i93,Estring is a super low dose vaginal estrogen.
10k5i93,Yes Im taking Larin-120 which is estrogen and progesterone. It was originally prescribed to stop period cycles and I took it back to back. The estring releases estrogen into the immediate area and helps rejuvenate tissues. I do weekly testosterone shots at home via intramuscular injection.
10k5i93,"And I just wanted to add that I discussed the best method for me would be shots because my absorption isn‚Äôt the best so the best method for testosterone is injection.

My hormone labs are interesting now. Estrogen has been the lowest of low even before testosterone and my T was low as well. Now the T labs are probably in the elderly male/PCOS range. Enough to get a little fuzzier and some acne but otherwise, significantly less side effects than any med I‚Äôve taken."
10k5i93,I agree.
10k5i93,"I wish I could give you a hug. Just think of it this way, you've ONLY been together for 4 and he's showing you after only 12 months that this is who he is. You can get out now rather than years, decades of garbage."
10k5i93,Yeah. I guess I meant like patch as well. I use cream and patch.
10k5i93,"Are you having any side effects from the testosterone? Like deeper voice, body hair or acne? How are your emotions?"
10k5i93,"My voice hasn‚Äôt changed. I was told I was less nice and quicker temper at first but between you and me, I just had more energy to stand up for myself I think. When you have NO energy, you let things roll off more. Before testosterone , I had virtually no body hair. I had to shave leg hair maybe every two weeks, likely because my testosterone and estrogen were always too low. I have acne so I went to derm and asked for topical meds. I had acne issues as a teenager and I would say it‚Äôs on par with me at 16 yrs old. The only reason I went to derm is because I get cystic acne and I hate it. It took a year for it to get bad enough for derm."
10vtfm0,"Misophonia. I have always had to either leave the room when my husband is eating or I turn music on to drown out the noise. He understands that it's an actual brain condition and the sensitivity isn't exaggerated; it isn't 'nagging.' Popcorn during a movie? Forget it.

HRT doesn't help. Music during meals helps."
10vtfm0,"Girl,  don't get me started"
10vtfm0,My husband slurps practically ALL is food. Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is. Last night he was close to death as I bored holes into him and willed him to die. It‚Äôs BAD. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10vtfm0,"I just bought some Loop ear plugs and they have varying levels of noise reduction. The Engage is supposed to block out background noise but still allow you to hear a conversation.

I got the Quiet for sleep, which are working well, and the Experience because I‚Äôm planning to go to a concert in a few months. Haven‚Äôt really used the Experience ones yet but wore them around the house and they seemed to work."
10vtfm0,"Misophonia!  Lived with it all my life.   Here's how I deal with it: 

A nice (but cheap: second-hand) sound system where we eat.  CDs that are good to cover eating are easily accessable.  The volume knob is on my side of the table.  Music with dinner is totally a thing. 

Or eating in the same room pointed different directions: he looks at the TV, I look at the computer.  We watch movies, series, documentaries in 20-minutes intervals. 

But the best thing, the absolute best thing, is OSHA rated earphones.  20+ decibel reduction, hanging around my neck, anytime I need it. Very empowering! 

https://elginusa.com/products/ruckus-discord-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds?variant=31849729491080"
10vtfm0,"Always hated eating noises of any kind but the menopause has made that, and a host of other irritating noises, almost completely unbearable. I do have some earplugs that work to a certain degree but might have to push the boat out and get some really decent ones. I fear a killing spree might be on the cards otherwise!"
10vtfm0,"How I handle it with my teen. ‚ÄúSo listen, my menopause hates certain sounds right now. I might sit over here while we eat. I can‚Äôt control what the bloodless mistress focuses on. No hard feelings?‚Äù

Teen: shrug, ‚ÄúOkay mom.‚Äù"
10vtfm0,"It sounds like irritability, which is a cornerstone, so to speak, of the meno experience;)
The only thing you can do is talk to him about the noise üò∫

As far as ""how long"", I had my last period in early 2020 and the only thing that has helped me is HRT. I know many cannot use or decide against HRT, but it's the only thing that helped me.

I had night sweats all night with no sleep, the itchiness(!), And all kinds of crazy for two years. I'd be in the same state today, w/out my little patch friend. I was literally losing the will to live before.

I'm still quite a bitch, here and here. Might throw something at some point.

Edit to add:
Ha! Thank goodness you ditched the SB party. There would be way too many food items."
10vtfm0,That would be what my daughter and I labeled ‚Äúannoyances‚Äù and you learn to work through them.  Takes time but eventually it will move to something else.   My husbands throat clearing is a huge one for me now before that it was his sneezing loudly.
10vtfm0,"I‚Äôm not a good candidate for HRT, so I can‚Äôt speak to that question. But, being 51 and in late-stage peri (several months-long absences of periods), I do think my tolerance has improved for my husband‚Äôs chewing. I don‚Äôt seem to get as annoyed lately. Chicken wings are one of the worst for me, and we do plan to consume them during the Super Bowl, so we‚Äôll see how that goes. üò¨ (I also feel like my anxiety has been lifting lately as well, so maybe there‚Äôs a connection.) Hope you find ways to deal with your intolerance that doesn‚Äôt involve the D word. ü§ûüèª"
10vtfm0,"I have a similar problem with my husband‚Äôs chewing as well, and I got so frustrated at one point that I blurted it out. I was just so annoyed and fed up with it. He was hurt a bit, but he also wanted to keep the peace.. haha! Looking back, I should have made my feelings just as (or more) important than the possibility of him feeling hurt for a while. I bought a good pair of noise cancelling headphones (Sony WH1000 XM5) and that does the trick. A happy wife and all ends well üôÇ"
10vtfm0,Menopause has me hating his sneezing üòÇ
10vtfm0,I FUCKING HATE MY HUSBAND‚ÄôS CHEWING WITH THE PASSION OF A THOUSAND FIERY SUNS
10vtfm0,All men annoy me. Everything about them. üòú
10vtfm0,"The crunching!  I was working in a quiet space on a project for our company that was complicated and needed to be completed before we could move to the next step.  He was waiting for me to finish and thought that the best way to help would be to wander into the room asking ‚Äòare you done yet‚Äô whilst eating slices of apple. ( yes he knows) I glared at him and said you are chewing! He chuckled, then saw that he was about to die and beat a hasty retreat.  My point is I have not found anything that helps except a different noise. Music or tv or something the drowns out that infernal crunching"
10vtfm0,"I never put this together before. I seriously thought I was just turning into a nitpicking bitch, and probably getting a little crazy. Hah! I love this subreddit!"
10vtfm0,"For me, some of it his chewing, which now seems 
louder, but the thing that makes me want to take his head off is that he now goes ‚Äúmmm‚Äù often while eating. He does the cooking, so I don‚Äôt begrudge him enjoying the food, but sometimes he starts mmm-ing before he‚Äôs even finished cooking. We watch tv while we eat, and I mentally kick myself if I don‚Äôt have the show going before the first ‚Äúmmm‚Äù comes out."
10vtfm0,"Thank you for all the great advice. The commiseration helps tremendously and almost makes me weepy (shocking I‚Äôm sure.) Since no one mentioned it, I‚Äôll assume having his mouth removed is not an option?"
10vtfm0,"My husband can slurp DRY food. Or like, how do you slurp cheese off a pizza? For crissakes have some decorum."
10vtfm0,Are the quiet ones the industrial strength noise reducing ones? If yes those are the ones I need.
10vtfm0,"I have 2 teen boys. This made me smile, tear up (‚Äòcause your child was fine with it), and laugh all at the same time. üíïüíï

Great way to handle it! ‚ÄòBloodless mistress‚Äô is both perfect and hilarious!"
10vtfm0,Hi iam from India. 48 and had my last period in April 2021. Iam contemplating HRT. My issues are with constant painful UTI everytime after intimacy due to initial dryness. Its frustrating. Has HRT helped you in this regard. TIA
10vtfm0,"OMG!! I just had a little post earlier today about how I feel bad if I say something less than positive about my dear husband online but I have to tell you that one of these days he's going to sneeze and they're going to find me dead in my chair from being startled to death. I've had sneezes sneak up on me and end up being kind of loud but HONESTLY every time he sneezes it's like a shot goes off nearby. My heart stops. WHYYYYY,

And to the OP, mouth noises are only one of the things that have started getting on my nerves during this time of life. We have a very old house with a porch light timer that is an old fashioned mechanical dial. It goes TICK-TICK-TICK-TICK 24 hours a day, in the entry right by the area where I sit to knit and watch movies. I kind of want to take a class on home electrical wiring so I can rip that motherfucker out of the wall without electrocuting myself. Irony: the front porch lights don't even work anymore so it's ticking for no goddamn reason. We just had to have several repairs done to the house so we can't afford an electrician right now but as soon as we can, that thing is toast."
10vtfm0,Same!! I was so down on myself because my husband is really fantastic but the chewing makes me angry and disgusted.
10vtfm0,"Yes. Like, WHY?? He says it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs hot. Don‚Äôt get me started with how he eats apples. ü§¨"
10vtfm0,"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre at industrial strength level lol. They filter out the road/neighborhood noise and my cat yowling at 6 am to be fed. But light enough that I can still hear my alarm in the morning.

The silicon ear plugs actually filtered out more noise but they were hurting my ears and I was having trouble finding them in stores.

I‚Äôm excited to try out the Engage at the concert. I sometimes get too overwhelmed by the noise plus so many people but I found the foam ear plugs to be annoying and not great with the sound quality."
10vtfm0,"Hi,

I lucked out and was spared the vaginal dryness so far, and UTIs, but I have read that vaginal estrogen can help with that!
I'm on the combi-patch. üå∑"
10vtfm0,I‚Äôm so sorry! UTI pain for me is about 100 times worse than child birth.
10vtfm0,Then WAIT FOR IT TO COOL YOU MORON. Quit taking giantass hot bites.
10vtfm0,Hmm. I have very noisy upstairs neighbours so I‚Äôm looking for a way to block them out.
10vtfm0,Agggghhhhh!!!!
112boem,"This happened to me as well, but I think it's due to having post nasal drip for the first time in my life.  This peri business is like closing your eyes to grab a random present...from the worst Secret Santa ever!"
112boem,"OMG yes random nausea and vomiting. It's awful. I got a prescription for Zofran, and it is a lifesaver. I take it (dissolves on the tongue) as soon as I start feeling queasy, and it works in 10 minutes."
112boem,I literally just came on this sub for this reason. Thanks to OP!
112boem,I spent years seeking a solution to this issue. It started out just occasionally and lasted just a couple minutes and progressed to daily and quite severe though still lasted only 30 minutes to an hour in the middle of the afternoon.  I knew the prescription anti nausea meds would make me sleepy which would interfere with my work so I sought every thing I found that might work. I finally found what works for me. A combination of dandelion root tea and licorice root tea. I drink one cup of each every evening and have not had a recurrence in over a year.  I will never be without them again.
112boem,I had this. Wasn't sure if it was a medication I'm taking or just meno. I carry peppermint lifesavers with me at all times. It takes the edge off.
112boem,"I go through this,  off and on. In menopause even"
112boem,Definitely have it around ovulation cycle (or ghost cycle sometimes). Ginger chews help a ton.
112boem,I've had chronic nausea for over a year now... sniffing rubbing alcohol gets rid of it instantly when it surfaces. I was on Reglan but I didn't want the side effects.
112boem,"I have it and it's new for me too AND, I also can eat an entire meal after. It's definitely like when I was pregnant. I had nausea but could eat a houseful of the right food."
112boem,I‚Äôve been dealing with nausea for quite a while but recently stopped drinking coffee and it has helped the nausea take a hike! Fingers crossed I‚Äôve found the cause. I hope you do too.
112boem,"I had that as well,  pretty much daily.  Usually in the morning.  I'm 10 days post lupron and it's finally gone."
112boem,"I had mystery nausea for months at one point. Then I was hit with a BPPV (vertigo) spinning spell, and my doctor said that the nausea I was experiencing was a common issue with BPPV (and not everyone gets to the vertigo spinning portion of it- sometimes it resolves before that, but I wasn‚Äôt so lucky).

Maybe check in with an ENT & have them do an exam and see if that‚Äôs an issue."
112boem,Any new symptom that's persistent should be checked by a doctor.
112boem,"Ever since Peri kicked in, I cant stomach breakfast or the the thought of food first thing in the morning, I gag and dry heave and some mornings vomit. I have always been a big breakfast eater. Peri sucks."
112boem,"I used to have an iron stomach, but she's definitely much more sensitive these days. I've never been a person who could wake up and eat immediately, but lately I have to get something in me with my morning coffee or I am likely to get a terrible stomach ache or awful wave of nausea and shakes."
112boem,"In peri now, and had no idea about this connection. 

Me too, OP. Just hits me out of the blue."
112boem,"Yes...past three months during PMS, I got debilitating nausea.  I asked my doctor about it and she said that it's normal and from peri hormone fluctuations.  Sometimes mid-month I'll get a wave of nausea, usually in the early evening, that lasts for about a half hour.  What has helped:  Sea Bands...Tummy Drops (on Amazon)...lots of water...saltines...smoothies made from frozen fruit...laying down for 30 minutes after I eat (if I'm able).  I also have a Zofran prescription if it gets bad.  I'm not on HRT yet but I'm hoping that will help."
112boem,I would def get a zofran rx. It‚Äôs a game changer.
112boem,Check your gallbladder! Usually starts that way
112boem,"Yes, I just randomly up chuck, around period time."
112boem,Ondansetron is good too! Works very quickly as a sublingual.
112boem,Thank you so much for this advice!
112boem,Omg that‚Äôs a great idea
112boem,I‚Äôve heard that and recently bought alcohol swabs to use.  My gag reflex is also super sensitive now.  Ugh.
112boem,I quit alcohol 2 years ago and I can‚Äôt do coffee too! I‚Äôm glad it worked for you too
112boem,Oh that‚Äôs really interesting
112boem,Thank you so much for your kind and helpful response. I keep hearing about Zofran
112boem,That‚Äôs just the generic for zofran.
112boem,I hope you find what works for you.  It really is miserable!
112boem,Oh I know it! Alcohol makes me instantly sick.
112boem,"It actually kind of is interesting, considering the population affected by it the most is perimenopausal and postmenopausal people.   (The theory is that our lowered estrogen effects the strength of our ear bones (some people call them crystals), which with BPPV have broken off and float freely in our ear canal, and that is what causes the symptoms.) üòä 

Hope you can figure it out!"
112boem,Didn‚Äôt realize. Thanks!
112boem,Thank you so much. You‚Äôre a fantastic communicator by the way.
112boem,"That‚Äôs very kind of you to say, thank you‚Ä¶ my goal is to get a job utilizing written communication, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start given my educational background (I was not an English/writing major, although my degrees and especially the last program (law) were very writing-heavy, you could say) or previous work experience. So to hear someone say that gives me a boost of confidence; I‚Äôll have some pep in my step today for that (really, you don‚Äôt know how much it means!). üòä üíï

110ljcm,"This might sound lame, but when I feel blue like that because of my sky rocketing and nosediving hormones, I remind myself that this will not last forever.  I will eventually feel better. Whether it be a few hours or a couple of days, I will feel better. In the meantime, if I need a nap, I take a nap. If I need to be lazy, I will be lazy. If a walk or jog could make me feel better, I will do that."
110ljcm,Wanted to send a virtual hug and say you are not alone.
110ljcm,"That happened to me. I‚Äôm 48. It was weird. The Nipple thing, can‚Äôt remember it happening before. I was overjoyed ‚Äúmissing‚Äù my period thinking it was the beginning of the end. Then it came about 2 weeks late. Really bad, clots, and hasn‚Äôt stopped now for 40 days. I‚Äôm
In misery. I‚Äôd start your medical journey now. Not sure how long it takes for you but for me I‚Äôm 5 months away from a gyno appointment. Wish I had been on the list while my periods were heavy and not sucked it up so long."
110ljcm,"I enjoyed The Menopause Manifesto and Estrogen Matters to get informed when peri kicked my ass at 42. The info helped, and made me feel less alone. And the nipples sweet Jesus, the nipple/breast pain in peri is unreal even on hormones. It‚Äôs the only symptom they didn‚Äôt clear up for me."
110ljcm,"I'm skipping a couple of periods now and I still get the other symptoms as well as high definition, kick you in the face hormones.  The PMS seems to subside after I finally get a period but then keep ramping and persisting until I finally get a period again months later. It's hideous.

My period has been in hiding for nearly three months. I'm off to a hot tub cottage break tomorrow. Guess who has come for an extremely enthusiastic visit today? I'm seriously DONE!"
110ljcm,"Please read [this thread,](/r/Menopause/comments/xubqk2/is_this_perimenopause_read_this_first/) and our [Menopause WIki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index), there's recommended reading, podcasts, youtube videos, and research."
110ljcm,Sure you‚Äôre not pregnant?
110ljcm,This happened to me. I felt like I was PMSing for 3 weeks out of the month. I got the hrt combipatch and that helped me.
110ljcm,"Hello! Girl, I'm with you and sending you support. I'm also 45. This is my first time checking out this group and I am so happy to see your post. About a year and a half ago, I skipped my period for the first time ever since I was 12. It returned the next month regularly again, which made me happy, but it wasn't quite as heavy as normal. In January, it happened again where it felt like I was going to get my period and it didn't come. I felt all my normal PMS symptoms and then boom, nothing. I have a little bit of less than-spotting.  I am also feeling depressed. Even though my husband and I don't want kids, it feels weird to be at this stage with my body. So many emotions going through me! Sometimes, I feel like a kid or 21 or my age -- or even way older than my age. Yes, the PMS hasn't left at all and I feel like I look bloated. Are there special vitamins we can take to relieve our symptoms?"
110ljcm,"Thank you! Oooh I‚Äôll have to see what HRT is and educate myself and read more in this group. The one time I saw my OBGYN she didn‚Äôt really give me any advice or words of wisdom. It feels good to actually hit ‚Äújoin‚Äù and own this change in me. I love hearing about you being an art teacher. I do poetry and am going to graduate school to work in the grief field. I‚Äôm starting a part time job next week to work with kids in prek actually. Cheers (with my mocktail) to new and old experiences for usYes, all our styles our back from the 90s. In around 2015, I had a Nineties birthday and dressed like Angela Chase from My So Called Life. Good times! Thank you for the book info - can‚Äôt wait to check it out."
110ljcm,How did you build your trust it wouldn‚Äôt last forever? I recently had three good weeks of sleep and now I‚Äôve barely been able to sleep for a week. No aids are helping and I‚Äôm so depressed. I keep hoping it will get better but I feel so down‚Ä¶
110ljcm,"Thank you, I want that mindset.  I forget it exists when I'm in it.  I have absolutely zero personal time, so I can't do that lazy or nap thing, maybe contributing to this struggle.  Some days, my body feels so whacky and tired and emotional but I don't have any sick days or anybody to watch the kids so I can't take care of myself like I should be during this period of my life.  But you're right! Nothing lasts forever.  This too shall pass."
110ljcm,"5 months!? Well, I have some bad, unaffordable healthcare but can usually get appointments.  I'm going to look for a new doctor though.  After I bled for a couple of  weeks straight, the doctor told me I was probably just starting the menopause journey and to drink more soy milk.  Then, another doctor told me I was too young to be experiencing symptoms.  To her credit, she did figure out that I had Hashimoto's/hypothyroidism.  That did help some symptoms that I thought were perimenopausal.  But in the end, yep still peri and need a doctor that will really listen."
110ljcm,"I think hormones cause breast pain for me, even on low doses (but much less on low doses than higher doses).  However I had breast pain occasionally in early stages of peri before HRT as well, just didn't yet have the symptoms for which I got on HRT.

So yes soon after I turned 43, I experienced exactly what is described here a missed period and feeling like I was drowning in estrogen, sore breasts, engorged vulva etc..  At this point I wish I was drowning in estrogen I think, but I can't take that much and likely don't make much anymore either.  But the experience described is familiar from that time."
110ljcm,"Apparently my body just joined you in solidarity. Finally, FINALLY have a vacation coming up in 3 days. Anniversary weekend. 

Last month it was 53 days no period, solid two weeks of PMS symptoms super sore boobs bullshit. Finally got a period 13 days ago so thought I was in the clear for the vacation but guess not since I just started bleeding again, complete with full blown cramps. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is this bullshit!?"
110ljcm,Thank you so much.  I'll head there next.
110ljcm,"I haven't had sex in a year, so no.  Another depressing story for another time."
110ljcm,"Im going to make an appt with a new HRT friendly doctor.  Last one told me I was ""too young."""
110ljcm,"Thank you! Support right back to you.  I don't know about vitamins! Everybody keeps talking about HRT, I need to find a doctor who will talk to me about it too.  And I know what you mean, I feel young and old. I'm an art teacher and I dress like my teenage students half the time (luckily they are into 90's clothes). And I just don't feel ready to be this person! It's strange to have this structure that is part of what your life moves around and defines so much of being a woman.  And now it's going to change.  I started reading a book that somebody posted above, called the Menopause Manifesto - really good so far.  I think it's free on Kindle.  Anyway, lots of hugs as we embark on this journey. Lucky to have ways of support like this group."
110ljcm,"It started when my two oldest boys went into boot camp. I would tell them to remember that no matter how crappy it got, that it wasn‚Äôt gonna last forever. They were gonna get to the end, and boot camp would be over. So, when I feel miserable, why wouldn‚Äôt I tell myself the same thing I told my boys?  Why is self talk so negative, but the way we talk to others is kind and encouraging. Imagine your inner child. How would you talk to her?  It took me a while to get there, but here I am. I just choose to be kinder to myself than I used to be. Hang in there. Lots of love."
110ljcm,"I don't think most menopause symptoms last forever for most (maybe vaginal atrophy), but I do have a hard time believing that things really get better.  Like my sleep will always be bad right?    But meno symptoms like hot flashes usually end, ok yes, but research shows sleep in older people is often lacking too even though they are past it, so their sleep is not lacking \*because\* of menopause (heart palpitations, hot flashes, hormone fluctuations etc.) anymore, but because of other processes of aging.  And maybe I'll just have other problems of aging as well, like arthritis etc..  So it won't be \*this\* particular hell, but it will just be another one right?  Things will never really be good again will they?"
110ljcm,"<3 I hate that the hormones or whatever cause sleep disruptions and then the sleep disruptions make it harder to cope.  Sleep deprivation can be part of a really rough spiral.  Hang in there, it has to get better!"
110ljcm,"It is utter nonsense, that's what it is. Sometimes I think we are being messed with. We will just have to ignore it and try to have fun anyway!"
110ljcm,Absolute bullshit.  I miss that cycle predictability!!

10ujc81,Thank you for posting.  Makes me feel less alone.
10ujc81,Thank you for sharing
10ujc81,"What kind of work do you do and what is your social life like? Any exciting hobbies or new loves?  Wondering if it's more than just the physical, even tho i know  your issues are in the body."
10ujc81,"Gosh, same. I just want to feel alive. I feel like zombie, just going through the motions. Is it going to be like this forever? 

I just got rid of all my supplements as I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing much."
10ujc81,"I‚Äôm 48.  Making changes when and where I need to, listening to my body, mind and soul-myself more.  Practicing gratitude for what I have in my life, primarily that I still have my body and it has carried me through a lot of hardship, grief, pain and joy.  I exercise regularly, eat healthy more often than not.  I drink wine every other day.  I‚Äôm embracing moderation and balance in all things.  Ask me in a few days, it might change.  I accept that, too.  I do not believe in panacea‚Äôs, but I do believe in doing what we can to feel better.  I don‚Äôt think there is a way to go fully back to how we once were, and do I even want to?  I think the life span challenge now is:  what next?"
10ujc81,Thank you for posting. It makes me feel better knowing that I am not the only one taking various supplements and doing various things just to try to feel okay. It's definitely a struggle at times
10ujc81,"So much the same. I could have written this post. My menopause doc checks my blood every 6 months and I take all the meds/supplements you take, plus whichever ones needed according to the blood results. I strength train. I run. I cycle. I also have a sexy, supportive husband, a very fulfilling career.  And I still feel like shit, all because of menopause."
10ujc81,"We‚Äôre in the same, sad boat x"
10ujc81,"Just a suggestion but I don‚Äôt know what dose of hrt you‚Äôre on and whether it‚Äôs worth investigating upping the estrogen.  Having been through a chemical menopause and tried lots of hrt‚Äôs at different doses, I was amazed how affected I was when the estrogen dose wasn‚Äôt enough.  The younger you are the more you need and they tend to start off conservatively - but you may have already been down this road, but when they increased my dose I began to feel marginally better every day and it took about 4 weeks till I levelled off at ‚Äònormal happiness again‚Äô.  Also I didn‚Äôt get on well at all with the oral progesterone at all unfortunately, and wonder whether trying a different type like the merina coil might help your mood/energy, as there‚Äôs less floating around in your system and some people can get low mood from progesterone.  I can manage the progestin in the patch which isn‚Äôt as good for you, but it doesn‚Äôt give me any negative issues. 
No other ideas - you sound like you‚Äôre doing everything right."
10ujc81,Normal is gone I guess.
10ujc81,"I'm 47, 4 years into peri, and do a lot to feel kinda ok (including sometimes having to double up on the marijuana and the progesterone to sleep).  And I'm using at least 3 vaginal treatments now for that area (on top of HRT).

But I drop most things that I think have no affect at all (supplements and melatonin.  I do take vitamin D3+K2 in the hope of my bones not crumbling).  It's too much trouble to do things that don't work."
10ujc81,"I feel pretty crap too.  About 3 years peri menopausal.  I had major surgery last year so thought my brain stopped working because of anaesthetic - then realised my brain had stopped working long before that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I take CBD oil and nothing else except for a few vitamins because I‚Äôm low on iron and sodium.  The CBD gets rid of the rage without the effects of THC (I wanted to still be able to drive)  No HRT for me yet.  I‚Äôm determined to try to stay away until I can long bare it.  I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if all the crap I‚Äôm feeling is the chronic pain or per menopause.  Whatever it is, it‚Äôs shit."
10ujc81,"If you still have the energy to do all that stuff, I think you are doing well. If you can keep it up, post-menopause may be smoother for you, and hopefully better than ok.

 I've been postmenopausal for 10 years, and I used to be active, watch eating, and so on, and I would love to be just OK."
10ujc81,"Three years in, feel like a slug most days. Sleep is my main problem, cpap not really helping, now I‚Äôm on adderall to keep me feeling awake when I‚Äôm awake. I‚Äôm on bioidentical e,p,and t. Why don‚Äôt I feel like Suzanne Somers? She looks great!"
10ujc81,"Goodness me woman . Taking a lot . Your migraines could‚Äôve associated with low estradiol- how much are you on for patches 
??"
10ujc81,"I‚Äôm 50. Thanks all for posting here. I have felt so alone recently. This shit makes it hard just to function. I‚Äôm a nurse: I‚Äôm making stupid, not yet dangerous mistakes; the only foods I crave are sweets, everything else tastes bland or awful; my husband doesn‚Äôt get why I want to lay around on my days off or why I‚Äôm so tired; my mom doesn‚Äôt understand why I cry a lot. Jesus H. I‚Äôm on so many different modalities to help (HRT, supps, spiritual path, ADHD meds for lack of attention and safety while working and driving) and I‚Äôm merely surviving not thriving. FML."
10ujc81,Thank you for posting and same only I am not at even moderately ok yet
10ujc81,Adrenals?
10ujc81,Green tea has caffeine?
10ujc81,"try monitoring your  blood sugar. you may be creeping in on insulin resistance. i found full fat yogurt and oatmeal were spiking me to 200+ (normal would be about 140) i lost that weird bloat by giving up dairy - this worked for me but you may have some other/same issue 

i started with a purely vegan diet all veggie, and am adding things back in here and there you can pinpoint any food sensitivities this way

loosing estrogen can increase insulin resistance. and you can be prediabetic for decades before your numbers will reach the threshold for a dr to say something"
10ujc81,"Yep. I have thought so often in the past 3-4 years, what if I didn‚Äôt have a super flexible schedule, make decent money, have a lifetime of good habits to build off of, and be very disciplined? Like I‚Äôve put in so much work and am at the point where I feel alllmost normal again. I just try to be grateful I have the capacity to work so hard to get myself to baseline. And also try to take advantage of days where I have loads of energy and then not beat myself up on days that I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a real rat race, this feeling normal. But I refuse to compromise! (I‚Äôm also super stubborn lol.)"
10ujc81,"I  need to start using a white noise machine again.  My neighbor is now taking long showers at 2:30 am breaking my fragile sleep.  This is madness, even in menopause I'm not doing completely insane things like taking showers at 2:30 am waking up the neighbors.  WHY??!!"
10ujc81,"I have a creative work from home job. I like my job. I have hobbies. I have friends and a sexy husband. 

It‚Äôs like peri showed up and made everything harder and I now have all this extra stuff to manage just to reach baseline."
10ujc81,I have the .1 patch.
10ujc81,"Hi, what dose CBD do you take and how often? It hasn‚Äôt worked for me yet, but maybe I need to use more. I also want use less thc bc it makes my brain so dumb,"
10ujc81,"My migraine frequency really kicked up at the beginning of peri - from a couple times a year to once a week. The migraines are now coming every 3-4 months. Definitely hormone related. 

I‚Äôm on the .1 patch."
10ujc81,"Surviving, not thriving. Menopause in a nutshell."
10ujc81,"I'm 50 and also a nurse-I totally get what you are saying re: making stupid mistakes. It's scary-I worry about doing something dumb that could end up hurting someone. I plan on hopefully transitioning to something non-clinical like case management soon. While I love having four days off a week I am having a tough time with the 12.5 plus hour shifts-they wipe me out. 

On another note, did you start taking ADHD medication in midlife or earlier?"
10ujc81,Uuh. I feel you. My neighbor has taken to walking in effing HEELS at 2 AM on a hardwood floor. What is wrong with people?
10ujc81,I‚Äôm not certain what my dose is as I‚Äôve been buying a different brand.  I had used the prescription CBD and it was quite cost prohibitive to keep using.  It was $300 a month.
10ujc81,"Was just diagnosed with ADHD 5 months ago. Completely has to do with perimenopause. I went off birth control 5 months ago (after being on it for 12 years)and it was basically, apparently holding my mental, emotional and physical bodies together. I had no idea how much it was helping me. Now I‚Äôm a smoldering dumpster fire."
112d2vh,"I have probably tried 800k in shampoos/products/conditioners and here is what worked for me: Rice water conditioner. I use biolage moisturizing shampoo, then rice water conditioner, then microfiber hair towel, then bond maintenance by olaplex, then use aveda paddle brush. If I use heat to dry or curl then I have to use a serum for keeping it from looking dry and I love love love l‚Äôange gloss serum. My daughter has thick, kinky long hair and the l‚Äôange gloss and serums make her hair so smooth (she likes to blow
it out 3x a week). Aveda makes a great conditioner if you are going salt&pepper that tames my white hairs - its called Blue Malva. I use that maybe once a week or so to tame the gray. I also find that an eyebrow shaping brush with a little serum helps tame
the shitshow of baby hairs that stand up on end. Good luck - it took so so so much trial and error."
112d2vh,I am using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and it's lovely
112d2vh,"Ok so my texture has changed multiple times 

Number one check the water and:or just put a filter on the shower head. Mine is much more sensitive to hard water now. 

Also I‚Äôve found several products that at least helped me manage some but take it w a grain of salt bc everyone‚Äôs hair is so diff. Ie everyone loves bringing but it‚Äôs worse than like suave atp. 

I‚Äôve gotten amazing results from the redken acid bonding complex system. I‚Äôve tried multiple combinations of it but using the entire system at once was freaking magic. 

The Better Not Younger Bounce Back was so softening. And moisturizing I had comments on my curls that day 

Pattern beauty hasn‚Äôt missed yet.  And the same with the Melanin hair products 

It‚Äôs worth noting I‚Äôm biracial w multiple curl patterns but mine got seriously wiry and unmanageable out of nowhere and I‚Äôve found these products have helped.  ESP the water filter in the shower."
112d2vh,Maybe too much protien? Too much protein can have a similar effect :(
112d2vh,"Yes, Garnier argan oil shampoo and conditioner....love it x"
112d2vh,"All I got is stop coloring if you do. I had a weird frazzly top layer to my hair that went away when I stopped coloring. Granted, I might have been able to still make it work if I tried harder/sunk more money into it but I couldn‚Äôt be bothered. I just stopped."
112d2vh,"Have you ever tried the curly girl method for hair? It really helped with my thick wavy hair.  I don't really co wash as much as they recommend, but I've tried to eliminate most silicone containing products from my hair repertoire."
112d2vh,"Curly girl here. It‚Äôs gotten way frizzier the last few years. I did Olaplex No.3 3-4x a month for 6 months, now Olaplex no.8 1x a week. It‚Äôs worked wonders. I feel you! Good luck."
112d2vh,"Similar issue. Plus so fly away and static-y. I cut my hair so I didn't have to have it up in a clip all the time... and it's up in a clip all the time, just to keep my face from feeling like I'm fighting spider webs."
112d2vh,"Following since my hair became extremely thin, fine, frizzy and gray-streaked post-hysterectomy."
112d2vh,"Omg, mine too. I can't stand to touch it or look at it. And it smells weird too."
112d2vh,"As a swimmer, I‚Äôve given up! Que sera, sera!"
112d2vh,Express keratin treatment. My hair stays full and wavy if I want it wavy but no frizz. It‚Äôs soft to touch.
112d2vh,"I don‚Äôt even need to ask - I already know you‚Äôre washing it too frequently. No more than twice a week should you be washing

Use a scalp oil before washing (I like jvn but there are many) Air dry as often as you can. Use a humidifier at night. Take collagen and biotin and zinc supplements too

But most important is to not wash it too often and omg definitely not every dayo"
112d2vh,"I cut my hair short and I use coconut oil on my hands as a moisturizer and then ‚Äúdry‚Äù them off by running my hands in my hair.  Hair is much softer doing this vs using conditioner.

Also I stopped washing it as often.  Most of us white folks have been taught to shampoo our hair everyday.  Shampoo companies list it on the bottle to do it everyday but they just want us to buy their product so even if 1x a week would work they won‚Äôt put that.  Maybe as young adults it was necessary but we should all reevaluate as we age. I‚Äôm 46 and just don‚Äôt feel like my body always needs a shower every day anymore.  However a some days I feel like an oily otter and take two lol.  When I shower I rinse my hair as the warm warm feels good but I use shampoo about 2x a week."
112d2vh,"African Pride Olive Miracle Anti Breakage Formula. Best thing ever. I was at my friends house and my hair looked dry, crispy, and just bad. I too have curly/wavy hair. 

She handed me the container of this stuff. I put it on my hair. Game changer. Friend also suggested going to a black owned salon for a conditioning treatment. I will be making an appointment."
112d2vh,I have 4c type curls yet I‚Äôm white and am getting away from shampoos and conditioners. Using historical methods learned from Katherine Sewing on you tube. It‚Äôs been a game changer.
112d2vh,"Castro Oil is amazing,  if it's too thick for your dry hair try putting it on your wet hair."
112d2vh,"Me, too.  If you aren‚Äôt already using sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, I‚Äôd suggest giving it a try to see if it helps (before you buy a bunch of expensive products)."
112d2vh,Yep. First step is to remove all products containing protein from your routine.
112d2vh,"Seconding argan oil. Different brand, but same love"
112d2vh,"I haven't, but I think that I need to. Thank you"
112d2vh,"To be clear: some people‚Äôs hair loves protein, but for the people whose hair hates it, it creates nightmarish straw hair."
112d2vh,Here is some great info about it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/10xu5xh/start\_here\_beginner\_info\_weekly\_no\_question\_is/
112d2vh,Thank you so much! I had no idea
10ekgmi,"Listing out loud, every day , what I am grateful for . Going outside ( even in what appears to be a dead wintry scape ) and appreciating what‚Äôs happening .I often have to work at it . This was all sparked by a micro dose of mushrooms some time ago . It brightened things and reminded me of this deeply . I have to get there on my own since but I have stayed consistent with the grateful , the appreciation ( I try to learn something about something outside I see ) also I realized that I do  step outside every night (even in the inky blackness or the clouded soup ) and usually have to force myself to be there for the count of 10 .I LOOk UP! 
I can‚Äôt even tell you how many times my breath has been taken away , how the sky changes , what I I see or I hear !! The cumulative effects are real for me ."
10ekgmi,"I am 47 and still menstruate regularly like a well timed train. I'm not even in peri. 

And i feel this way too often. I call it being ""world weary""

because at this age, we are dealing with more stress than 20 years ago. At this point, we might have marriages we don't want anymore, adult kids with adult problems,  careers that we are burned out on. You get the idea. Someone said....you spend the last 40 years of your life getting over the first 40.  Our energy levels are not the same which is not a function of menopause but simply being older. 

I think a lot of us are too quick to pin our mental and emotional problems on menopause, when taking an objective look at your life and circumstances may suggest that it's otherwise."
10ekgmi,"It takes time.  Meno saps the passion out of every cell, unfortunately.  Sex seems silly, sunny days feel pointless, but world affairs that probably don't even directly affect you become emergencies that set your heart racing.  It's a weird weird time but it does pass.  A gratitude list helps keep things in perspective (even if you don't always *feel* grateful)."
10ekgmi,"Same here! No husband though but I just posted about how at the end of the workday I just want my Netflix and chill time. I'm taking a friend to dinner tonight and I already wish I could just stay in. It's definitely concerning.

I feel enormously better on days that I get up and get a work out in first thing. I'd say it helps my general mindset tremendously but as the day goes on I feel my overall interest and motivation depleting"
10ekgmi,"I have been feeling like this for a couple of years now. I thought some (if not all) of it had to do with a couple family tragedies having a deep psychological effect on me. However, I‚Äôve been dealing with this peri stuff since May of 2022. The timing fits. 

It‚Äôs like I really do not give a crap about *anything*. I have days here and there where I want to just end things.. like, life just seems meaningless. But most days I just feel indifferent. (I‚Äôm married and my college-aged kids are still living at home). Pretty much nothing engages me."
10ekgmi,"I totally relate to the ‚ÄúI lost my sparkle/mojo‚Äù feeling. I have been experiencing the same thing for a couple years now. I am on HRT but that hasn‚Äôt brought it back. I‚Äôm not depressed, life is good, but I just don‚Äôt feel that zest for life that used to motivate me. I wish I had an answer to share!"
10ekgmi,Thank you all for sharing- it makes me feel like I'm not alone in how I'm feeling.
10ekgmi,"Following because I am going through the same thing at age 50. I feel invisible and frumpy AF. I don't feel motivated to make social plans. I don't really fit in anywhere socially. I come from a dysfunctional family background that makes me prone to attracting people with Cluster B personality disorders. 

I just want to snuggle my dogs, drink wine, and read and watch things. I am prone to depression and anxiety, I take Wellbutrin. I used to like to use cannabis, but I now live in a part of the US where that is illegal and could get me a ticket/jail time/visit from child protective services if my super-conservative neighbors caught me toking in the backyard. I have some Delta 8 gummies. They are like THC-lite. They help me loosen up and find the humor in things, but they also make me slightly high, so I only take them on weekend evenings. 

Anyway, solidarity and support, ladies. You aren't alone."
10ekgmi,"I understand how you feel. I went through a period of flat emotions at best to anxiety or anger at worst. Anti-depressants helped. I also have a history of depression, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was actual depression or hormone changes or some combination. 
Not saying that you are depressed, just that anti-depressants worked to give me back a range of emotions."
10ekgmi,"Wellbutrin helped me. I started on 150mg and one day accidentally took two pills, and felt so good I went to 300mg. I have energy, positivity, am able to finish projects, and have the motivation to start meditating (also super helpful). I know it‚Äôs not for everyone but it definitely made a difference for me."
10ekgmi,"At this age, there is nothing much new going to happen in life, we have done or not done with our lives whatever we are going to.  There's nothing left to look forward to really.  And I knew as soon as I hit meno so hard that I would HAVE TO give up all my ambitions (re work and stuff), because I couldn't do that in the physical state I was in.  So I bid them all good bye, good bye all I may have still wanted in life."
10ekgmi,"This may be controversial and I cannot recommend it obviously, but microdosing psilocybin gave me back all my feelings: joy, tears, humor, silliness, anger...full spectrum me. 

I took HRT for cognitive decline, hot sweats, depression. I added DHEA for libido/energy. And I got somewhat stable, but was only a shell of myself.

Microdosing brought beauty, sorrow, and love back to me. My life is richer now."
10ekgmi,"I feel like it‚Äôs ok to not be ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time, if that‚Äôs the right word. Lol  I call myself boring but really just being content and easy going and a homebody is ok. If you‚Äôre sad maybe you need a hobby?"
10ekgmi,"I was feeling that way for a long time without being really conscious of it. At some point I enrolled in one of the online weight loss platforms and they prescribed Bupropione (aka Welbutrin). It didn't really help for weight loss but I noticed a side effect that it really helped my mood A LOT. I was much less grouchy and didn't want to kill my husband as much LOL. I was on a dose of 150mg which I believe it considered low. I recently learned that it doesn't have the same negative impacts on energy levels, sleep, and weight that other SSRIs do. My doctor recently decided to up the dose to 300 for me since I have fairly nagging anxiety so I am gonna try this next. Anyway if you have never tried an anti depressant it might be something that turns on the light switch for you like it did for me."
10ekgmi,"Exercise is helping me. I only started over the last month (walking and cardio drumming), but I feel better. I feel more emotionally balanced."
10ekgmi,I sat with my husband last night and discussed these exact feelings.  It's almost as if I wrote the words to your post.  I'm 50 y.o. and need to snap out of this.  I've always been active and social but currently have no desire for anything.
10ekgmi,"Could have written this myself, today was particularly blah for me. Another day might have words of wisdom, but wanted to let you know you‚Äôre not alone."
10ekgmi,"I gave my hormones a year to help with that. I felt about 80 percent better but still partly felt like you do. I ended up going on Wellbutrin, an antidepressant which I‚Äôd used in the past. It really pulled me back up to feeling pretty good."
10ekgmi,"Holy shit! Is his is me too!!! I‚Äôm peri and the last few months I‚Äôve lost interest in all my regular activities, I feel rather lost and don‚Äôt know how to get back on track."
10ekgmi,"Me. Flat. Lethargic. Surviving not thriving. Languishing. I've tried hrt, Lexapro,  trintellix and weed. I just finished Stutz the documentary on Netflix. Ordered the workbook. I've decided that I'm going to fight with all of my strength to get up again. Unless I can't. Then I will know it's not fixable."
10ekgmi,"For me, it's doing anything and everything to be present as consistently as possible. When I feel blah, everything becomes a chore. Doing anything is only a means to something else. Eventually nothing is enjoyable. 

Practicing gratitude is really helpful. I'll also change up my routine to try to enjoy things more. Maybe listen to music while I clean the house. That kind of stuff. It's really just getting out of your head. I also take a lot of walks. Less news watching is also helpful. Lol"
10ekgmi,"On my side I take HRT that helps me with sleeping issues. Which was causing me all the problems like mood, feeling, deprrssed etc  ...
Now all good. Feel energised , good mood, alive"
10ekgmi,"That‚Äôs exactly how I feel about life. 2 year post menopause. I‚Äôm not on hrt but do use vagifem. I‚Äôve started this year telling myself I need to find my zest for life and have made myself have a focus. Can you set yourself little goals, like meet friends once or twice a month, go for walks and build from there"
10ekgmi,Community service and yes I‚Äôm serious.  If I was a doctor I would write it as a prescription.  Life changing
10ekgmi,"Thanks for this post, I‚Äôm going through the exact same and all the comments are helpful. 

Big hugs to you"
10ekgmi,"Literally deciding, every day, to try to have a good day.

It's not always easy!"
10ekgmi,"I am also struggling with this. The inability to feel enthusiasm for friendships and get myself out and about is wild. My world is shrinking. 

I've also lost my sense of humour in a way - my kids jut last night were saying that I never laugh. I did not realize it had come to that.

That being said, I just went on a work trip and I really enjoyed it - and thought to myself that I need to start going out more.... and forcing myself to feel joy."
10ekgmi,I love the idea of intentional gratitude! I don‚Äôt practice it enough.
10ekgmi,"World weary is soooo how I feel. I feel bogged down and drained by world events of the past few years, trauma my family has been through, fears of aging and my parents aging, and just general jadedness. I look at the world through such different eyes than I did even a few years ago."
10ekgmi,Well never getting a good nights sleep that is part and parcel and inescapable in peri/meno doesn't help.
10ekgmi,There are more of us? I'm 50 and still ovulating and menstruating right on schedule.
10ekgmi,That‚Äôs a good way of putting it. I have no passion for anything anymore and I feel worn down by the world and all the chaos in my busy life (3 kids).
10ekgmi,Same! I always get mad at myself for making plans when the day comes. I just couldn‚Äôt be bothered lately. It feels like too much effort. I just started weight training to see if that helps.
10ekgmi,"Same, I don‚Äôt feel engaged by anything anymore. If I had a mantra right now, it would be ‚ÄúEveryone is stupid and I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù üò¨"
10ekgmi,"That‚Äôs exactly it! It‚Äôs not quite depression, I don‚Äôt think, it‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ apathy. And definitely a lack of motivation (because what‚Äôs the point lol)."
10ekgmi,I'll second the benefits of delta 8! So glad it's legal!
10ekgmi,"Thank you, I just restarted my antidepressants. I am wondering if it‚Äôs partly low key depression too brought on by this time of life."
10ekgmi,the same exact thing worked for me. I was given 150 as part of a diet program and the side effect was that it helped so much with my mood! My doctor recently upped my dose to 300 for anxiety which I haven't tried yet but will soon.
10ekgmi,Just upped to 300 today.  ü§û
10ekgmi,That makes sense. I do feel as if I‚Äôve become more boring! One day I‚Äôd like to get back to creative writing but now I struggle to keep all the balls in the air every day. I do feel I lack a purpose nowadays (other than being a maker of dinner and taxi driver for my 3 kids).
10ekgmi,"I also wanted to share that this week I volunteered at my kid's school b/c a company came in to volunteer with campus beautification (some tech company had their annual sales conference and they devoted one day for their employees to be out in the community volunteering, great global citizenry!) and it made me feel that I have been so isolated and withdrawn from the world for the past few years. It was inspiring and energizing being amongst all those adults doing good deeds and felt so good to be experiencing that. Maybe you could explore some different volunteer opportunities that spark joy for you?"
10ekgmi,"I don‚Äôt either ‚òπÔ∏è. I feel like maybe I should join the new gym down the road to try to kick up my dopamine levels, but I can‚Äôt be arsed to make the effort!"
10ekgmi,"I do think a lot of it has to do with my energy levels. I am pretty low energy most of the time. My sleep has been slightly better since starting HRT, but has gone downhill since my husband started having to wake up at 4am for work and I can‚Äôt seem to ever go back to sleep üòû."
10ekgmi,And how!
10ekgmi,"To further compound the problem, women disproportionately take on the burden of all things family and household, while working a full time job themselves. Its one thing to do this at age 27, but quite another at age 47. 

I advocate for women to stop doing what they can stop doing. Whether that is stop investing energy into a bad spouse, quit doing household work for everyone, or stop providing emotional labor.....whatever it is that YOU can stop, then stop doing it and redirect that energy into yourself and your well being."
10ekgmi,Certainly not alone there.üíïüòî
10ekgmi,"I'm 46, but same.

Except I have excruciating joint pain that appeared out of the blue, hot flashes, brain fog, sleeping issues (waking up multiple times a night), crazy irritability and rage like I've never, ever experienced in my life.

But ovulation/menstruation? Like clockwork."
10ekgmi,"49 in March and the same.  Still think I am in peri based on mood, sex drive (or lack there of), weight gain etc‚Ä¶"
10ekgmi,"You hit the nail on the head! I have been feeling the same way for months.  Not truly sad or depressed but flat.  I have lost my motivation for lots of things, have no libido, hate the way I look and feel, etc.."
10ekgmi,"In the song Jack & Diane (I think) there‚Äôs a lyric:

‚ÄúOh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is done‚Äù

This somewhat sadly sums it up I think"
10ekgmi,"I take HRT and that has helped me in general but the rest I'm really trying to focus on the good and healthy things I can do for myself. If I start out with a workout and green smoothie I feel on a much better track and notice a real difference. I'm working on being more consistent and not letting work consume me. 

I also realize there are just some things and people in my life that I just need to let go of. I'm just over the mental drain and energy of some people with their same old stuff. I'm moving in a few months and feel excited about that but obviously I can't just keep moving, ha ha"
10ekgmi,Yes!! Everything/one is stupid and I don‚Äôt care!! üòñ
10ekgmi,"Anhedonia hit me like a ton of bricks when I entered peri. Hasn't lifted 3 yrs later, tons of therapy, environmental, health and fitness changes, finally on anti-depressants and do not fall into the pit of despair. But I don't go ""up"" again, Lost my mojo, just like what you're experiencing. You are not alone, and nobody ever warned me."
10ekgmi,Yup. I‚Äôm not crying but I don‚Äôt have the desire to clean or get dressed (besides sweats). Energy is zapped although I slept most of the night. I was exercising but keep gaining. Usually still force myself but thinking why bother? I really hate gray weather and it‚Äôs tough here right now. Think that doesn‚Äôt help.
10ekgmi,Depression whacked me in the head in my 40s and it was like I became that hopeless 14-year-old self all over again.  Took a while to put together that adolescence and perimenopause are hormonally-charged changes and their force shouldn't be underestimated.
10ekgmi,"Right?! I‚Äôm a highly motivated person, or at least I was. Last few months have been no hiking, biking, even walking the dog is becoming a chore and I love my fur babies. 

I‚Äôll end up talking with my primary but right now I‚Äôm a big blob of blah."
10ekgmi,"Oh doesn't help waking up at 4am.
And lack of sleep or good sleep doesn't help for the energy.
I would say try sleeping in different beds for a bit to confirm if that's the issue."
10ekgmi,"Boy, does it ever! Life has definitely lost its thrill‚Ä¶ that sense of infinite possibilities we had when we were younger."
10ekgmi,"Totally agree! I don‚Äôt have the mental energy for soul sucking people or doing things out of guilt or obligation. I‚Äôve had to trim the fat and be more selective about who I spend my time with. And yes to being healthier. I need to start feeding my body better and moving more, I can‚Äôt treat it like I did in my 30s."
10ekgmi,üòÇ It‚Äôs awful isn‚Äôt it? But a relief to know I‚Äôm not alone.
10ekgmi,Anhedonia here. Ironically I‚Äôm less anhedonic than when I joined Reddit a few years ago. Testosterone has helped me with it quite a bit.
10ekgmi,"Oh gosh, there‚Äôs a name for it?! üò≥"
10ekgmi,This is so interesting and I‚Äôve been doing some reading. Apparently it‚Äôs not at all uncommon for menopause and anhedonia to go hand in hand. Thanks for the insight - I had no idea this was a real thing but clearly there‚Äôs many of us!
10ekgmi,"It‚Äôs so true! Can‚Äôt get away with the same stuff as when you‚Äôre younger. I used to think that was just stuff people said, now I get it"
10ekgmi,That is what I am hoping to get prescribed. Any side effects?
10ekgmi,"Yeppp. It's the ""inability to feel pleasure"" from Oxford English Dictionary. Lots of info online, though, lack of dopamine (and fluctuations HORMONES) seems to be the culprit. So if one is interested in finding the right anti-depressant, prob should talk to your Dr about dopamine re-uptake inhibitors. Buproprion has helped me in that area. Worth a deep dive into the Interwebs to learn more about causes and treatments for anehdonia."
10ekgmi,Just hair loss for me. I‚Äôm on a low dose though so it‚Äôs not terrible. It affects everyone differently though.
10ekgmi,"Same, bupropion has definitely been doing some heavy lifting for me the last few months. Even helped me lose some peri-related weight finally."
10ekgmi,"Anhedonia sucks, I've been flatlining for 5 years. Low dopamine is the key. I've got some positive feelings back from using amino acids L-theanine (which is in green tea) to reduce anxiety, and L-tyrosine for energy and focus or before exercising. Both work well with caffeine."
10d601i,I‚Äôm mad for you!! Ugh. I had to switch providers once it became clear I was not going to be treated for peri symptoms.
10d601i,"I can't even take HRT.  I can't begin to imagine the hell that would be raised if I had to set in a room of women in varying stages of hormonal disruption.  By the end of the first session, the poor lead will have written additional scripts, contacted the authorities to put us on all the watch lists, and preemptively declared us all insane.  

Is there no concern that the group would form a gang and make plans to meet up during our 3am sweat to rid the world of all that annoys us?  Putting moody, irritable middle-aged women in a room, together, sounds like a siper villain origin story."
10d601i,I had a doc like that. Dropped her that day. Btw I now get my hrt from [Alloy](https://www.myalloy.com/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=New%20Keywords%20-%2020-04&utm_content=Brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm5KRrsXL_AIV-ciUCR2-MQWZEAAYASAAEgJOsPD_BwE0).They send two month supples at a time. So far I have been happy with their service.
10d601i,I‚Äôm angry just reading this.  ****ing men.
10d601i,Make the doctor document in your chart that he is refusing to provide you with the medication that treats your symptoms. Make him document it.
10d601i,Do they have a support group for men's ED?
10d601i,"When that doctor needs serious surgery,  tell him to join a support group."
10d601i,Well done for not punching him.
10d601i,Why are they acting like hrt is an opiate?!
10d601i,I bet they wouldn't tell that to a man with ED!
10d601i,"Alloy telemedicine specializes in hrt-been using it for six months and it works great. I am on an estrogen patch and oral progesterone 100 mg.

That really makes me mad for you that your doc unceremoniously dumps all his menopausal patients off hrt just like that-it's bad doctoring imo, especially in light of the very new research that has come out connecting hrt to maintenance of cognitive function. 

Please consider alloy even if just for a temporary solution while you look for a new doc. Best of luck to you."
10d601i,"My pain doctor once told me I had to go to a group therapy for 20 hours per week. I have lupus and spend much of my life in bed, I don't have the time or energy for that BS.

My therapist wrote a letter saying we were working on practical (or something like this ) & experiential ways to cope with the physical and emotional pain of my conditions. It worked and I didn't have to attend the BS money grab. 

Do you have a therapist who can write some kind of letter like this for you?"
10d601i,Holy shit. Please tell me you can not only get a different Dr.
10d601i,"What was the rationale for that? On the face of it, it seem absurd"
10d601i,"A man definitely came up with that one.  Do you have a choice to get the HRT privately?  I‚Äôm in US but my HRT doesn‚Äôt go through my insurance at the moment.  It‚Äôs not cheap though.  Alternatively, there are over the counter products that may help."
10d601i,fuck that guy. evernow.com.
10d601i,"Don't let them bully you! You have to kinda make some noise I've found. Advocate for yourself! Insist that science is backing you up on this, and bring research papers with you! Can find them on Google Scholar. It would be worth it (if all else fails) to pay for it yourself thu a place like Mark Cuban's cost plus pharmacy!

&#x200B;

There has to be a way to get a prescription for HRT, even if you have to go to a free clinic or something....

good luck!"
10d601i,I use Evernow and I love it! Patches delivered. Chat when I need it. No BS
10d601i,"Wait, are you saying that your doc is discontinuing your medication?"
10d601i,Change providers.  This just happened to me!  I literally went doctor shopping to get an HRT refill... my provider decided not to RX them anymore.   I found one that was happy to refill it..   I highly suggest you find a new doc!
10d601i,Welp they are fired! I hope!
10d601i,"Ffs‚Ä¶ report him. He‚Äôs denying you treatment you are entitled to. Switch doctors‚Ä¶ men are just shit sometimes. I don‚Äôt care how many degrees they have, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are not thick as pig shit at life!"
10d601i,That is absurd. I would raise hell.
10d601i,"I don't get a choice. It's just the way our Public Health is set up. 

I have however given a heads up text telling I need to name of the absolute fuckwit who came up with this shit idea or he can sleep with one eye open. He is already scared of me. He will meet his responsibility."
10d601i,That is what will happen. Let's get a Script going.
10d601i,Wow I didn‚Äôt know about alloy!
10d601i,What types of treatment/meds are you receiving from them? If you feel the dose or type is not working what‚Äôs the process to talk to someone? This is so interesting!
10d601i,"Of course not. Men suffering hormonal issues get everything taken care of and paid for. No support group referral. 

Their problems are *real*.

Grrrrrrrrrr"
10d601i,"No and we also don‚Äôt have support groups for other common aging issues like presbyopia, osteoporosis, or prostate hypertrophy, because the medical community has deemed those issues ‚Äúworthy of treatment‚Äù.  This doctor‚Äôs mentality pisses me off so bad‚Ä¶"
10d601i,I like you a lot
10d601i,Perhaps they can chat their way through erectile dysfunction.
10d601i,"Oh I love that idea! 

I might rock down to the Practice with my Murder Puppies on a semi stolen Motorbike and my busted up face and my farm clothes and see how keen they will be on having me doing group work with all the fancy Ladies. 

None who can pay their own bills. 

I love a Shambles. Life Goals."
10d601i,"Right? Are we showing some worrisome, hormone-seeking behavior that must be redirected to Hormones Anonymous discussion groups?!!!"
10d601i,I second the Alloy recommendation. Been using them for 6 months. You also have access to your doctor to answer any questions or concerns. Very professional.
10d601i,Yeah it sounds like a patriarchy conspiracy . ‚Äú let‚Äôs try to force women over 30 to become crazy then we can laugh and ignore their medical problems. ‚Äú
10d601i,Yeah I do. I'm just looking at my 3 remaining patches.
10d601i,Oh I can do better than that. I can set the Health and Disability Commission on them. Also find out who came with this BS at the Ministry of Health.
10d601i,It will be a public policy thing but also supply chain issues. I might just steal a 747 break into the pharma factory and steal some shit.
10d601i,"Nope. It's all centrally recorded so even if I did go private it will be flagged. 

I just despise the thought of sitting around in a group setting being told all the shit I already know."
10d601i,You are the reason I love this sub
10d601i,Yup. It's HRT not codeine
10d601i,I will keep it DL.
10d601i,"You are a BAMF and I‚Äôm so here for it! üôå
Give ‚Äòem hell."
10d601i,"I‚Äôm in the USA and have an HMO and it‚Äôs the same ‚Äúsolution‚Äù here. When I had the courage to finally ask about my sexy drive, they tried to send me to a group for that too telling me with women it‚Äôs often mental. I was like no it isn‚Äôt. I worked full time had three kids with one breastfeeding and had to cook and clean and still had a sex drive. Don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm busy now. It‚Äôs hormones."
10d601i,"I heard from a family member that a her friend in Brighton had similar issues. She went to a private doctor for one session only which was expensive but as its just one booking thing, it's possible. So this doctor who I think was a high Street private doctor, took blood tests to assess hormone balance and lack of things such as estrogen - and have her a prescription for estrogen/hrt. From this point on all she has to to is now use this prescription with general NHS practitioner's who have to keep up the prescription as basically the test results speak for themselves. 

In my situation I was genuinely suicidal and not able to function, due to lack of sleep. I have met women who literally barged into a doctor's receptionists and refused to leave until she was seen because she couldn't take it anymore, and she had been ignored and placated for too long. I met another woman who was shocked that I hadn't had this, and I hadn't had that. She told me how she dealt with her next health issue which was at the beginning of COVID and amongst all the fear of not knowing what it caused.... She simply had a mild headache. When I met her she couldn't wait to tell me how she managed to get her head SCANNED, and then an outpatient appt at the hospital where she was given a full body /health check on the same day she had the headache which was at 4pm, one hour before the doctors close. 

She ranted and raved to get a scan by telling people on the phone if she wakes up dead the next day because of this and that.... And her age, etc. Which was about 55.  When she got to the scan department, she ran into a doctor or specialist she once saw about her hip. She described to me that she pointed him out, and said 'i know you?! Weren't you the one who WRONGLY diagnosed me with (something or other) I have spent the last two years doing physiotherapy and getting absolutely no relief because it turned out to be (something else) and now it's too late for me to avoid (something about the juice between the bones) making it worse! I hope you're going to help me' (I can't remember the rest)....

Now, this woman turned out to be like this about a lot of things, and I didn't meet her again after this just because we didn't gel. But I took her advice, you have to be quite confident and forthright about your health, the risks, the possibilities (in your case, such as bone waste and tissue atrophy which is what I risk because I'm not allowed hrt due to cancer, let alone brain converting into mashed potato). You have to let them know, that you know, and you've read up on it, (your country, your options, treatments available, what failure of services could result in). Etc etc. I haven't been that bad myself but I'm keeping it on my weapons inventory should I need it.

For now, pulling out the genuine truth and making it known to them, and not being shooed away about severity of symptoms, impact on my life, and mental health has got me through the fairly painstaking process of being forced to try every drug option till landing on the last option, then adding on anti depressants as well to further reduce sweats. 

I was referred to a menopause clinic fairly early on and whilst some of their nurses have insulted and patronised me on the phone and told me I'm being struck off the list because I want hrt, and she'll tell the doctor to make sure I never ever get prescribed it and so on.... The actual doctors were helpful.

Depending on the circumstances, I would say the cessation of hrt is negligent. Oh! Yeah, that woman told me to use the word negligent.
Xxx"
10d601i,That‚Äôs awesome üí™üèΩüí™üèΩ I‚Äôm sorry about being stuck with him though!
10d601i,"Estrogen patch. I had a full hysterectomy so don‚Äôt need anything else. I also have a local script, but my local pharmacy is often out of it, so I stare with Alloy. You do have to prove that you are who you say you are, and provide some medical info, like you would with any other doctor. I chose Alloy because they focus on women‚Äôs health and treat menopause like the real thing that it is."
10d601i,Your friends sit you down and say we need to talk about the patches. You have so many hormone patches on that you are putting them between your toes bc there's no room left anywhere on your body ...
10d601i,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with that. I was taken off of HRT after having a DVT. It's so frustrating. I have lupus (hence the DVT) and that provides enough frustration in my life. Not that I'm special, we all have enough frustration in our lives without doctors determining whether we can or cannot have access to hormones.

This is a wild idea, and I don't know if it will work. But would it be possible for you to cut the patches in half? It could buy you a little more time to resolve the issue, and if you do end up having to come off of your HRT it will be a more gentle step down. Again, I don't know if this is possible. I'm just spitballing."
10d601i,Can you get an online scrip? It‚Äôs a little more expensive but less hassle I find.
10d601i,"Please, please do that."
10d601i,"Buy some online from an international pharmacy to use in rotation so you can bank the farthest expiry date of the ones you get prescribed, just in case of future supply chain issues! I have an emergency box full of various types of vaginal estrogen, testosterone and extra pills, ""just in case"" and I just stick my new legit prescriptions in there when I get them, and then I use the stuff from the box with the closest expiration date so the emergency box is always fresh. 

Sure enough, my doc dropped the ball on renewing my vaginal cream prescription for 3 weeks (""must be a glitch in the online patient portal system!"") and I was so happy to be metaphorically sitting on a pile of vaginal relief."
10d601i,"I‚Äôm on patches and I have to drop my script off for refills at least a week in advance because they almost never have stock when I go in. 

I‚Äôve had issues recently with some of my other meds that are a bit more essential - think insulin dependent diabetic important but a different medication. I stop taking it and I will eventually slip into a coma and die. So far my GP and I have been able to dance around various dosages enough to keep me in supply - but there‚Äôs been a few occasions of having call around until I can find somewhere with stock, find out what dose they have so I can get a script for that size and make up my prescribed dose with multiple tablet combinations."
10d601i,"I‚Äôm sorry for you because I know I‚Äôd be a mess.  They‚Äôd have to pry my HRT out of my cold, dead hands."
10d601i,Geeez.  I don‚Äôt blame you.  Try over the counter products like Amberan.  Do they sell that where you live?
10d601i,Another new Bestie!
10d601i,"Second this, I love Alloy."
10d601i,I've tried that before. But it's really kind of you to suggest it.
10d601i,"Yeah. for sure.

Basement Jaxx Where's you Head At?"
10d601i,Good Luck with that in New Zealand.
10d601i,"I Know I'm informing all my peeps and the Cops. 

Apparently one of my second cousins went charging around the Wellington CBD naked with an axe. 

This could well become a family tradition"
10d601i,Never heard of it but probably not. I'll check it out.
10d601i,Gray market international pharmacies don't ship there? Ugh.
10d601i,Hahaha!
10d601i,"It‚Äôs on Amazon‚Ä¶.Amberen, or Estroven.  I tried Amberen once and it definitely helped."
10d601i,You can join. It was 87 stock market crash which probably didn't help.
10m704u,"I feel this so much! I decided that during menopause was the perfect time to start a brand new career. I‚Äôm in the middle of learning/training for it and sometimes I wonder, what the heck was I thinking?! I am enjoying the work though, so hopefully it will all go well. 
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do a great job, OP, and be fluent very soon!"
10m704u,"Honestly, I think it‚Äôs brilliant. Yes it‚Äôs extra hard, remarkably so, but what a great distraction from the hell that is Peri. I‚Äôm impressed and wish you the best with this journey!"
10m704u,"Ooh are you doing this full-time? For how long? Any particular reason?

I have nothing for input on language learning and menopause brain fog, but I got excited reading this as when I had a bit of a mental breakdown at age 35 I took 12 unpaid weeks off work to deal with the issues. After a month of twice-weekly therapy and N adjustment to my meds I went to an immersion language school in Merida for four weeks. My goal was to brush up on college Spanish I'd forgotten.

It was tremendous fun. I did a homestay with an older woman, her son, and her grandson. School was 4 hours of instruction in the morning in a class with only one other student. Then two hours of one-on-one time after lunch, practicing conversations and playing games and exploring the city. And then homework!

I was sightseeing on weekends and then after the course I went around the Yucatan by myself, to areas without many non-Mexican tourists or English speakers, getting around in Spanish."
10m704u,Wow. That's living!
10m704u,I totally admire you for this!! I'm really trying to push myself back into having a life. I've really cut myself off. Wow girl keep going x
10m704u,"Go you!  I started writing a book series in 2021 to combat the brain fog. It really helped, and now I‚Äôm on book # 5!"
10m704u,I started a PhD program in August! We can do this!
10m704u,I have also gone back to college. It is so hard. It‚Äôs just for a year but I‚Äôm struggling. Good luck to you! üòäüòä
10m704u,"I was just thinking about that. I‚Äôm back at university at 57. I have a test today and I can barely remember the name of the class, let alone the test material. My memory is shot! Why?!"
10m704u,"It's a crazy time in our lives, but I think what you are doing is so wonderful! Go you!

To ring in this new year, at age 47, I started getting seriously into Irish Gaelic. I love languages and studying them is one way I turn off the more anxious sides of my brain. But, damn, it is harder at this age. No joke.

Sometimes there is that ephiphany when what was formerly piles of linguistic clutter suddenly align in part and something new ***makes sense***. Gods, I love that feeling. Wishing you those rays of sunlight bursting through the clouds. ¬°Buena suerte!"
10m704u,"That's hard. When I had brain fog there was no way I could have done something like that. Even the dimplest mental calculation I couldn't do it.
If you achieve something in your state, well done.
For me only HRT works but it takes a nit of time to adjust and find the correct dose as it changes over time."
10m704u,Take it easy on yourself. Everyday go out and use what you learned. We retain more than we know.  You‚Äôre in Mexico!  !p.s. I have brain fog too. Trying to get back into reading regularly.
10m704u,I'm laughing.  I've been trying to learn Dutch for years.  All I hear is blah blah blah blah alsjeblieft!  I'm sure my brain is mush.  I wish you all the luck in the world.  If anyone speaks Dutch and wants a challenging student...please pm me!!!
10m704u,Congrats.... learning a second language is hard. Harder the older we get. I have been trying to upgrade my french skills and am encountering similar challenges. You are not alone. Lol
10m704u,I think you‚Äôre doing great. I keep on planning to learn more Spanish or pick up French again but it keeps falling by the wayside
10m704u,"OMG, a new career is a lot of pressure, but it's great that you're going for it. Just picture all those synapses greening up like the grass in spring and sprouting new connections (or whatever it is they do). And thanks for the encouragement!"
10m704u,I‚Äôm in the same boat. Just keep focusing on those new neural pathways they claim we‚Äôre forging!
10m704u,Thank you so much. Today was a tough day and I needed the encouragement.
10m704u,"Oh wow, you really dove in the deep end! I don't think I could have done that after a life crisis!  I'm here for 6 weeks and then I'm exploring other Mexican cities with my husband. My goal is to be able to speak easier with folks, although I'm a huge introvert. But in my experience, people here have been very supportive."
10m704u,That sounds so delightfully Shirley Valentine!
10m704u,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10m704u,"Ayyyy, same!! For some reason, fiction writing I can do. Remembering where the hell I put my socks five minutes ago or what day of the week it is? Not so much."
10m704u,Wow!! What kind of books?
10m704u,Love it!
10m704u,Thank you! üíï
10m704u,"Good luck to you, too. We'll make it!"
10m704u,"It's frustrating, isn't it? But hopefully this is helping our neuroplasticity, regardless of performance."
10m704u,"Adh mor ort! (Or so the Internet tells me.) It must be difficult to find someone to practice with, unless, of course, you're posting from Ireland."
10m704u,"Haha, Dutch has alllllll the consonants! Spanish, at least, is pretty much pronounced the way it looks"
10m704u,"It's so much easier to do when you're surrounded by native speakers, that's for sure!"
10m704u,"I went back to university at 43, not knowing that peri menopause approacheth! The first 2 years were a struggle, third year was a fucking nightmare, dropped out in 4th year, stared HRT last summer, went back last September and I can't quite believe the difference."
10m704u,"I'd done a ***lot*** of foreign traveling, mostly solo, in my life, so I'm pretty used to going to foreign places.

Sounds like you're doing very similar to me, though. Buena suerte!"
10m704u,"No one to practice with, but I am using Memrise (free version), a Spotify podcast, and the awesome Learn Irish channel on Youtube to try to get different sorts of exposure! Hope to make it over to Ireland and specifically a Gaeltacht area or two in the not-too-distant future. :)"
10m704u,It's so great that you returned! Go get it!
110b2rv,I wouldn‚Äôt give up on another baby until a doctor tells you it‚Äôs not going to happen or you are in full menopause. You can still get pregnant in peri.
110b2rv,I'm 44 and my periods went to 21 days 10 years ago. It's only been the last year that they double up or I skip one. You're still fertile as long as you have periods (barring any other issues).
110b2rv,"Obviously it's impossible to diagnose someone from 3 paragraphs, even if I was qualified to diagnose, but this reminds me of depression. Take what I Say with a massive grain of salt. What I mean is, the seeing that something has happened or has changed, and then seeing the worst possible outcome of that and not having much or any doubt in your mind about it.

How sure would you say you are going to ""have small kids and be menopausal"" and that it ""has ended my dream of another baby"", percentage wise, with 100% sure being no doubts and 10% sure being ""maybe it could be possible, I suppose""Answer in your head then click spoiler:>!unless there is a !<*lot*>! more evidence that you aren't telling us, if you feel more than 40% sure I would think that is more evidence this might be depression talking (obviously not an exact science, despite involving the use of a %!)  !<

Depression has a way of making us look for evidence/signs that depression is justified. It has a way of making us think and do things that keep it going, making us avoid things that stop it, as if it had a will to survive. You wrote three short paragraphs, I could be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off base.

Anyway, back to practical terms, if it helps at all: my periods changed frequency many times, who knows why, the motions of the celestial bodies or something."
110b2rv,"I didn't want a third child, but remember feeling the same way in my mid-forties. It's the absence of opportunity and closing the door on my childbearing years, it is a loss."
110b2rv,"Im going to add my voice of reassurance. While you may be approaching perimenopause, it‚Äôs far more likely that your periods are wonky because of nursing. It can take a year for them to straighten out. Also there are lots of women walking around with peri babies. Even with late peri babies- like they didn‚Äôt get their periods for months and got pregnant. 

Finally, peri can take over a decade before menopause actually happens. More likely you‚Äôll be in full peri when these kids are going through puberty. Since you know to expect it, you can be medically prepared!"
110b2rv,"My periods were always messed up for a good 2-3 years postpartum. ETA- Just wanted to add that I had my last a couple months before 40, 3 years ago, so I get it."
110b2rv,You could potentially have another baby if you want to.  Many women get pregnant during perimenopause.    Personally I can‚Äôt imagine wanting another child at 40 but many women do it
110b2rv,"You said yourself who knows what is normal for you really and you‚Äôre sad about something that hasn‚Äôt happened. Those are classic anxiety symptoms, try to focus on what you know.

And to be a little firm with you, I‚Äôd educate yourself more if you‚Äôre going to catastrophize. You‚Äôre not menopausal, what you‚Äôre experiencing doesn‚Äôt meet that definition."
110b2rv,"I feel this way at 45.  It's going to be a process of mourning. My youngest is 6.  But! If you want another baby, try.  Even if your cycles are short, you're still ovulating.  Lots of my friends have gotten pregnant at 40."
110b2rv,"I've had 8 kids, and last one at 40. 2 miscarriages after that. My periods started going wonky in my 30s!  Ask your mom or aunts what their patterns were. Mine were very similar to my mom's, but my aunt and grandmother both had early hysterectomies."
110b2rv,"Periods are wonky after pregnancy and breastfeeding. It might have nothing to do with peri. Because you just had a baby, it‚Äôs going to be easier for you to get pregnant this summer. I wouldn‚Äôt worry at all. Our bodies do change as we age, there‚Äôs no getting around it. 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, + when the decade turns over I think it always causes us to be more focused on those changes and the passing of time. If you want another baby, go for it. It‚Äôs more the opposite, we are fertile for a long time and need to remember we still need birth control to prevent pregnancy, even in peri. If you are truly worried you can have your doctor do a blood test to look at your levels."
110b2rv,40 is still young and women can get pregnant at that age. Not all of them but some. However if you're breastfeeding that could temporary keep you from ovulating.
110b2rv,"Do not give up. After I weaned my last, it was a solid year and a half before my periods came back. 8 months is nothing! Your hormones are going to take their time leveling out."
110b2rv,"While I hate to accept it cycles from 21-40 days are still normal. Ugh. I‚Äôm 44 and I‚Äôd pay all the money to stop having a period and just to stop all the symptoms. All the money. But alas, my regular 21-23 day cycles are still ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Also it took me over a year each time I got off Bc pills to get my cycle back to normal. If you baby is still a infant, your hormones may still be wonky but it sounds like you are ovulating every cycle. They say a woman is most fertile after a pregnancy. I think most doctors encourage a woman to wait 1.5yrs so her body recover is but maybe it would be best to get pregnant right away"
110b2rv,"My periods started to shorten around 36 yrs old , from 33 to 25 .  Now i‚Äôm 53 and still about 23-24 days.

Menopause when you are 40 could still be quiet a few years away. May not even be peri yet"
110b2rv,"Hey! It seems like we may be in a similar boat. I am 38 and my ""baby"" is 3.5. I had extremely regular periods up until my early-mid 30s, when they went from 30 days on the dot down to around 27. It took a full year of timed intercourse to get pregnant, but I finally got a positive a few days after my 34th birthday. When my kid was about 6 months old, we started trying again. That was 3 years ago. Since then I found out I had Asherman's (uterine scarring from traumatic delivery) and had surgery to correct it. I also was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, and have been on daily thyroid medication. I have low AMH and high FSH, both indicating low ovarian reserve. I started getting hot flashes and night sweats after giving birth, which I thought was normal for breastfeeding and post partum. But they never went away. My periods are now usually 21 days apart, with an extra day of bleeding (went from 5 days to 6). I did 5 medicated IUIs (one resulted in a chemical) and 2 rounds of IVF (embryo banking only, no transfers yet). I have experienced near extermination of my libido, drastic drop in energy levels, nearly daily headaches, wild mood swings, massive reduction in memory, and a general ""dumb"" feeling. I feel blindsided by these symptoms and the loss of my fertility. My partner is kind, but fundamentally does not understand how devastating this is.

Please feel free to DM me if you would like to chat!"
110b2rv,Thank you. I feel like it‚Äôs my body‚Äôs way of telling me I‚Äôm too old for another even if it‚Äôs still physically possible. It‚Äôs a hard transition
110b2rv,"Thank you. Even though the literature stays that 21 days is in a normal cycleI range, I don‚Äôt know anyone who also experienced it. I was pretty shocked when it came again so soon"
110b2rv,"Thank you. No doubt there is an underlying depression about the realisation of the end of childbearing years because of my age (by choice or not) and I the next stage in life. 

I should have qualified the worry in my original post by saying that my mother went through menopause at 44."
110b2rv,Thank you. Exactly how I feel
110b2rv,Thanks that‚Äôs reassuring. I never had a period while BF and as soon as I‚Äôd finish I‚Äôd be back on the pill so I have no idea what a normal cycle is for me
110b2rv,"I know lots of women who had an oopsy baby in their 40‚Äôs, not too old‚Ä¶"
110b2rv,Yeah I grapple with having another at 40. I wish I had more time
110b2rv,"It‚Äôs hard not to react emotionally to big life changes potentially happening simultaneously. But I see your point, potentially being the key word there."
110b2rv,"You have been through such a heartbreaking journey. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to experience so much hardship. I wish I could say something, anything to bring you some comfort other than life really sucks and is incredibly unfair sometimes and I sympathise with what you are going through."
110b2rv,My periods went from 32 days to 28 after having a baby and nursing - FWIW!
110b2rv,"This isn't necessarily peri. As you well know, things can get wonky all over after pregnancy and breastfeeding. I know several women who had kids at 40 and beyond. You could still be plenty fertile."
110b2rv,"I got my period back at 7-9 weeks PP, breastfeeding with all of my kids. üò≠üò≠"
10k7tgg,It should be standard medical practice for all women! I‚Äôm sorry you feel like a failure. It‚Äôs normal - we just aren‚Äôt given proper education and understanding.
10k7tgg,"Yes! And I'm so mad that it took 20+ years for a doctor to not dismiss my complaints of pain during sex (""have you tried lube? how about relaxing?"") and actually send me to a PT with pelvic floor training.  If you do the homework in between sessions, you should see an improvement within a month.  

My PT only did pelvic floor work and I often saw the patients before and after me. They were mostly women, but some were men, and of all ages, strengths, and sizes.  She and I would often chat while she worked with me and she said the lack of understanding about the pelvic floor and all the issues that could be helped with some straightforward PT was tragic.  Good on you for being proactive and finding ways to improve your quality of life!"
10k7tgg,TBH a lot of people need PT even after childbirth!! this isn't anything to do with you but just the way the human body is.
10k7tgg,"I've done it, but not for vaginal atrophy. I had hypertonic pelvic floor--basically my muscles were too tight because of pain. I kept guarding, and eventually sometimes I couldn't even pee. It did help, along with hot baths, valium, estrace cream, and at home gentle yoga. Honestly, just having someone there to validate what I was going through and check in with me helped. Weirdly, I think my pain and the guarding response actually did give me vaginal atrophy? Even though I was not perimenopausal. The Estrace helped A LOT. I had vulvodynia, and it got rid of it."
10k7tgg,"I‚Äôm currently receiving pelvic floor PT. Much like you, I felt inadequate and like I‚Äôve lost some piece of my feminine self.
My mom also made it clear this was NEVER an issue for her ü´§

So far, I‚Äôm pleased with the slow progress I‚Äôm making. Thank goodness for this community and other menopause groups on other social media platforms. I do not feel alone or like I‚Äôm defective. 

I hope you find some success with your treatment and please take solace in knowing you are not alone."
10k7tgg,"I've been in Pelvic Floor therapy for a while now. I have a dysfunctional pelvic floor. PT has helped a lot. It's super common for people of all genders to have issues with their pelvic floor at some point in their lives. We need to talk about this more and normalize it and make people more aware of it, just like we need to do with menopause. That whole area of the body just needs to be openly discussed more by medical professionals and all of us, as the average person needs more information. It's great you have a good PT. It will most likely help you if you stick with the program."
10k7tgg,You should get a slip for this as soon as you leave the labor and delivery floor!
10k7tgg,I'm curious what kind of exercises they recommend to help with improvement?
10k7tgg,It‚Äôs not a failure to need support and exercise!  Pelvic floor health is often overlooked so you‚Äôre very lucky to be getting the help you need.
10k7tgg,"Dumb question maybe, but how does one find someone for PT? When I search for it in my insurance portal, nothing comes up. Google suggests looking for a ""urogynecologist"" but nothing comes up for that either. Do normal gynecologists do it?"
10k7tgg,My mom is 70 and only recently started needing incontinence products. I‚Äôm 40 (and no kids) and have needed them for a couple years :/
10k7tgg,I‚Äôm not menopausal but got pelvic floor pt to address painful sex after rape and it‚Äôs helped a lot.
10k7tgg,I bought a Perifit. You insert it into your vagina and use an app that tells you if you‚Äôre doing Kegels correctly. You literally play games on your phone that you control with your pelvic muscles. Ten mnutes a day is all you need. I saw an improvement in how often I was leaking before I could get to the bathroom.
10k7tgg,"I used to refer to pelvic floor therapy as ""very special therapy."" It was uncomfortable at first, but in the end it was life-changing in the best possible way."
10k7tgg,https://www.amazon.ae/Sensatone-Digital-Compact-Pelvic-Stimulator/dp/B003ESN9QW
10k7tgg,"I'm signing up for this too. They're totally overbooked so I won't even see the urogynecologist for months and pt will come after, but yup, you have a lot of company. 

I also wish this had been prescribed years ago. Like after my  vaginal births. I like to think newly post partum care is better nowadays, but sort of doubt it."
10k7tgg,"There‚Äôs no failure here, our body betrays us as we get older. You‚Äôre doing something about it, a lot of people don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up"
10k7tgg,"Absolutely noticed a difference. Pelvic Floor PT should be apart of our yearly care. I love it!

ETA- I went after my 3rd. Wish I would have went much much earlier."
10k7tgg,"Pelvic floor PT helped me SO much! No more leaking pee. Better sex! Hell, I can be on top now which was never pain-free before.  
  
Everyone can benefit for properly working muscles. No shame in that."
10k7tgg,Emsella works!
10k7tgg,">but some were men,

The most surprising thing for me to learn is that pelvic floor disfunction in men shows up as rectal prolapse and throwing out their lower back. For women, it's uterine, bladder and rectal prolapse, incontinence, and others.

You learn to use muscles that you didn't even know you have, but once you learn which ones to engage and then add core abdominal and lower back muscles, it's easier to get where you need to be. Be sure to practice fully relaxing them, too. So worth it."
10k7tgg,Thank you for your comments!! So happy that it has helped you.  I am very hopeful it will work for me as well.
10k7tgg,I‚Äôm sorry your Mom said that to you. I have told my daughter more than she ever wanted to know about this journey. She has endometriosis and suffers with very painful periods. That was never an issue for me. It costs nothing to empathize with our loved ones and total strangers alike. We all need to feel seen and heard. Thank you and I wish you all the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10k7tgg,Apparently my vaginal muscles are tight and weak. That about sums me up. üòÇ The PT told me to practice breathing and doing some leg lifts. Also I have to order vaginal dilators. This is gonna be a weird ride!
10k7tgg,You are so right. I am very blessed to be able to get the help I need. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10k7tgg,I am seeing a physical therapist that specializes in pelvic floor therapy. You may need to call a few places to see if they offer this service. Best of luck!
10k7tgg,"Search pelvic floor physical therapist, or women's health physical therapists. Gynos are no help."
10k7tgg,I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. Very glad it‚Äôs helping you. Hugs to you.
10k7tgg,I have been using this machine plus reformer Pilates and can feel great improvement. Got it from Boots UK
10k7tgg,I wish I had done this sooner too. My daughter had a baby last February and went to therapy for several weeks which really helped her.
10k7tgg,That‚Äôs fantastic! Hope I get the same results.
10k7tgg,What is emsella?
10k7tgg,"I should clarify, my mom has been supportive and empathetic. Sometimes her communication can come across as harsh. 

I‚Äôve been sharing my experience with everyone who will listen, my daughters included. This is not what expected, but I‚Äôm rolling with things the best I can."
10k7tgg,I don‚Äôt get anything from those searches
10k7tgg,Oh thats nice to hear!
10k7tgg,"Emsella is a chair that delivers electro stimulation to your pelvic floor, it‚Äôs like doing more kegels than you could do on your own. Femilift is a painless laser wand for vaginal tissue rejuvenation. I did both with my OBGYN and was really happy with the results."
10k7tgg,What country are you in?
10k7tgg,Do you have to keep doing the emsella  weekly/monthly or is it a short course that lasts forever?
10k7tgg,US. I meant that I don‚Äôt find anything under my insurance portal. Google gives me a few results nearby that don‚Äôt take my insurance
10k7tgg,I did it 2x a week for 3 weeks. It‚Äôs so easy!
10k7tgg,"I suggest searching and coming up with a list of the right providers in your area, then looking up their names in your insurance plan. I had to do that with physical therapists when I had TMJ problems."
10k7tgg,I only found not so great comments about the Emsella on here. What did you notice after treatment? What were your issues? I have issues with mixed incontinence
10k7tgg,"I had bought a little contraption a few years ago called Elvie, that measures the strength of your kegels on an app. It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs like a game. I was great at it when I got it, then didn‚Äôt use it for two years. I just forgot about it mostly, but I was also thinking I didn‚Äôt need it because my kegels were so strong. Then I started noticing I‚Äôd leak a little pee with a big sneeze or cough, so I tried using it again and I had absolutely no muscle strength. Maybe it‚Äôs use it or lose it, I don‚Äôt know. But it was pretty depressing. So I did Emsella and it brought my muscle strength and control right back to where it was. It worked really well, and if I have to I‚Äôll do it again."
10rjfe9,Yes totally understand the numb feeling. In the last year a few devastating things have happened where I know I should have big time empathy and the feeling just hasn't been there. I've had to literally put  it on and pretend I care to protect others. Life has become more and more boring. I haven't been able to cry or laugh. Then we realised my HRT patches were not working so I'm back on tablets now..just started yesterday so clinging on for emotions.  I hope you pick up..wishing you all the best üíï
10rjfe9,"#Yes! There were times when I cried so much every day I thought I would float down a river. Now, after peri-menopause and post-menopause,  the pandemic, losing 6 relatives, both cats dying, only daughter leaving for college, step daughters estranged, I have the much advertised zero fucks to give.

I wish I could go back to exercising, but I have no spark. I never could get hrt, despite asking 4 gyns. I hope that I am not beyond help. My energy is at an all-time low. And the worst part? I just don't care."
10rjfe9,"I feel for you.  I am so far one of the lucky ones in terms of mood and energy, but I have the insomnia and lost my appetite like you.  This is an ordeal and sucks so much but we have each other at least and know we are not broken just enduring a chemical storm.  Strength and solidarity to ya!"
10rjfe9,"Thank you for posting this. I was thinking about this also recently that I do feel very emotionally numb and a new level of reduced bonding with people I normally  have felt bonded two, even my kids. I have wondered if the menopause changes have  affected levels of oxytocin? Or is this a detachment that comes with aging and maturity?"
10rjfe9,I just contacted a therapist because I feel like this. I chose her because the description on her website spoke exactly to this! I hope we all can find some relief! I can say that I am starting to feel a little better since starting HRT patch last month.
10rjfe9,"I'm still getting my ""feelings"" back after starting HRT. Before, when I was having symptoms I was either numb or HYPER emotional for a short burst, then back to numb.   
If you know you know, but I watched Episode 3 of TLOU(The Last of Us), while my partner WEPT, I was sad but so numb to everything that they finally looked over at me and said ""Are you okay?"" I was like, you yeah, I'm SUPER SAD, I just can't seem to process it."
10rjfe9,"Yes, yes yes! Ugh us poor women that have to go through this horrible thing called meno*""***!üò•üò°üò≠ I've experienced the same lately! It's brutal! Even when I'm hungry, I can only eat a tiny portion before I feel sick or full. Feeling you my friend!üíú"
10rjfe9,"I'm with you for the numbness. I don't care about anything anymore, my life is so boring and I don't have the motivation to change it. Unfortunately, I am eating all the time though, I wish there was some loss of appetite!"
10rjfe9,"THXXX for sharing ~ you have described it perfectly & I totally get the lack of empathy/compassion & boredom‚Ä¶I cannot laugh, cry or get angry etc. How is your motivation?"
10rjfe9,I feel the same at the moment.  I'm taking Femosten tablets but I'm exhausted and feel bored to tears all the time.  I seem to have lost interest in everything
10rjfe9,I TOTALLY relate to the not caring part it‚Äôs the worst ~ why won‚Äôt they give you HRT‚Ä¶
10rjfe9,Do you ever get hungry? I don‚Äôt 24/7!
10rjfe9,"I read something about that ages ago, I'll try to find the article.  Something about how for some menopause comes with being a bit more selfish in that we stop wanting to put everyone else first and take care of ourselves.  

Maybe that's why most of the divorces between 45-60 are initiated by women.  It's harder to put up with stuff."
10rjfe9,I think it‚Äôs a change in brain chemicals ~ I also now find it harder to connect w ppl & hold conversation‚Ä¶
10rjfe9,"What HRT are you on (oestrogen, progesterone, testosterone)?"
10rjfe9,Totally relate ~ do you have chronic boredom‚Ä¶because nothing interests you anymore?
10rjfe9,THXXX for sharing ~ I hope things improve for you‚Ä¶stay strong sister.
10rjfe9,Yes the numbness & boring seems to go hand in hand ~ I‚Äôll swap you for appetite‚Ä¶
10rjfe9,When I started my HRT a year ago (tablets) I started to get happy to get up in the morning ..wanted to walk my dog..wanted to go swimming..wanted to shower in the morning..WANTED to live. I gained my want .. and with that I decided to start working out and discovered that 20 minutes a day evolved into 1 hr..I loved it. Sadly there were supply issues with my HRT and I had to switch applications bit by bit my meno symptoms progressed and all the joy in my life left. Working out felt like a dream. In the new Yr I forced myself to get in a 12 wk walking workout program to try and get mobile again as I was literally just doing the basics to survive. I'm nearly at the end of wk 4 now and I'm so achy!! I'm pretty motivated though as I realise I can actually do it. Plus I have faith that my meno symptoms will lift due to getting back on the right type of HRT. I have been feeling really bloody poorly for 8 months!! But yea motivation can be hard..I found I had to grasp onto something I really loved and force myself back into it. What is your most loved thing in life?
10rjfe9,Ahh shit it really can be a load of crappy bollox can't it!? On top of all this meno stuff I've just manged to get myself a heavy period too..I am sure it could be worse :/
10rjfe9,"They have said, ""You don't need it"" You are having a beautiful menopause"" ""it's too late for you"" ""You should have asked earlier""  wtf?!?"
10rjfe9,"Sometimes I do feel hungry in my stomach, but don‚Äôt want to eat anything.  I do, because I want to stay healthy, but it takes effort.  I am losing weight but I can spare another ten pounds before I need to maybe see a doc about it."
10rjfe9,0.075 estradiol patch and 100mg of progesterone. I started on oral estradiol but felt really anxious. This is a lot better.
10rjfe9,"What HRT did you take (oestrogen, progesterone, testosterone)? I have lost everything I love ~ my passion & just enjoying the simple things in life‚Ä¶not to mention my career & relationships etc. I used to travel the world now can‚Äôt even do a domestic trip."
10rjfe9,It‚Äôs like telling someone not to take Panadol when they have a migraine headache.
10rjfe9,I lost 10 kilos ~ but I‚Äôd much rather be hungry & healthy‚Ä¶
10rjfe9,"Of course the way things are going with me and doctors, they will just tell me to seek therapy *rolls eyes*"
10rjfe9,I am on Estrogen oral and progesterone  sweetheart.  Are you at an age where you think this could be meno? For me HRT gave me back my joy. Oh I wish you the very best of luck I really do x
10rjfe9,Yeah. Or they are in denial about you having a headache.
10rjfe9,Definitely @ that age & haven‚Äôt had a period for a year now? Best of luck 2U2!
10rjfe9,Gott alive the medical profession.
10rjfe9,My goodness is it possible to get yourself to see a doctor ASAP?  I bet there are alot of symptoms coming up that you could put down to meno. I was so relieved when diagnosed as I literally thought I had some kind of cancer or brain tumor (common thoughts in meno) Please go and see someone and get yourself some life back üôè x

10fiigs,"I‚Äôm equally 90% back to former self after dealing with anxiety, insomnia and depression plus the usual suspects of hot flashes, aching joints, vagina dryness and atrophy. Plus I‚Äôm no longer angry at the world. Viva HRT ü•Ç"
10fiigs,"So happy for you!  It has definitely been life changing for me, too."
10fiigs,"I think the problem is the name: hormone replacement therapy. (I realize there are also other names as well)

 My body doesn't make enough estrogen. If I have a uterus, then I must also take progesterone. It's not a replacement or therapy. I just need a prescription for the things my body doesn't make enough of anymore."
10fiigs,"Check out Angie at [Hot & Flashy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9rHRAeSzi--j1jkXQ47RA), a 60 year-old post-meno woman who started her youtube channel at age 50 when she was struggling to find good skin care tips for 'older' folks.  She offers really great info, plus recommendations for make-up that doesn't settle into wrinkles, etc."
10fiigs,"That‚Äôs excellent news üòä I‚Äôve been wondering what it is I need, and it looks like I‚Äôm low on progesterone. I had a mirena fitted at 40 for the prolonged bleeding, but it sent me loopy too and had to come out. Now I‚Äôm nearly 48 and willing to consider HRT‚Ä¶I‚Äôll try anything at this point as I can hardly get out of bed. Thanks for the insight!"
10fiigs,"Oof. I too would like to hear about curbing THE DRYNESS. Yeah, sure huyaluric acids and skincare stuff is great, but the dry is coming from INSIDE. My latest fun thing has been itchy legs. Ohhh I feels so good to scratch! No hives. Just itchy. Was told my Eastern med doc to add more ‚Äúyin‚Äù foods‚Ä¶ which I already eat a ton of. So I‚Äôve been eating 2 tsp of flax and chia a day in hopes that the omegas will help. 

From what I have read, the dryness is a result of estrogen drops. Yes, I am also on HRT. I‚Äôve had itchy issues since my thirties and no one actually addresses the causes. No, itch creams don‚Äôt work either and antihistamines are hit or Miss. 

Anyone else?

Edit: typo"
10fiigs,Yay! You can read through r/30PlusSkinCare for some moisturizer ideas. If you've vanicream moisturizers/washes in the UK those are good esp for those w/ allergies or eczema and supposedly so is the Simple line.
10fiigs,I‚Äôve always had dry skin and am extremely sensitive to products.  I use squalane oil on my face (I use timeless brand) and avocado oil for body.   Also make sure you‚Äôre eating enough healthy oils and fats as that makes a huge difference too.
10fiigs,"Right so...I'm glad this come up. Cos a while a go someone here suggested elf holy hydration as their peri skin saviour and I was interested to check it cos I really like vichy permenopaussl DAY cream- don't rate the night version ...so I finally bought elf home yesterday and they quite similar but I still think the Vichy Perimenopausal plumping day cream is so good , lasts and goes on the creaminess.
...there you go..hope my purely anecdotal research is of use..Those Davina programs were a god send for me..I was still in the absolute dark...as in head in sand and I doubt I'd have changed that quickly if I hadn't seen it."
10fiigs,"I'm really happy that HRT worked for you! I have an appointment next month and I'm going to seriously talk to my female physician assistant.  Hopefully I get prescribed a  combination HRT, and I would really like to get testosterone as well. I'm sure I'll probably have to get labs done first so it's still going to be 3 months before I have any relief. üôÑ

As far as dry skin, I tried Neutrogena sensitive skin moisturizer for my face."
10fiigs,"Congrats! I‚Äôm thrilled for you 

For dry skin what I do is baby oil on my wet skin right out of the shower- then lotion on top of that. Ceravie in the blue tub or Palmer coco butter lotion are both inexpensive options- but the lotions alone are not enough for me. I need oil

For my face I love the new squalane and vitamin c rose oil by biossance. Again, old and then moisturizer over top."
10fiigs,"Glad to hear it!  Re: dry skin - another shout out for baby oil on wet skin and then lotion over it, if needed (cocoa butter is my new fave)."
10fiigs,"I am dealing with surgical menopause and unfortunately can‚Äôt do hormones because I have the BRCA 1 gene mutation. I slather Bepanthen cream on anywhere I have dry skin, heels to scalp haha. It‚Äôs my holy grail. Saved my chapped lips after years of searching. Also perfect for using with tretinoin. A little goes a long way and it takes about 10 minutes to fully soak in.  It‚Äôs also great for healing. In addition, I have been taking sea buckthorn oil (soft gels) and I think I can tell a difference in my dry skin everywhere!"
10fiigs,"For the dry skin, get some fish oil into you. It works wonders."
10fiigs,"I get aloe butter (it's hydrogenated with coconut oil) and refined shea butter, stick equal parts in a glass jar, put it in the microwave to melt it, put the lid on (not tight) and give it a wee shake to mix it, then put it in the freezer until it's frozen. If you don't freeze it, it'll solidify in a way that feels grainy. It makes a lovely body butter, and it feels slightly cool when you put it on. If you're in the UK, I get the ingredients from Akoma Skincare. I've got super picky skin and get on well with this, plus it doesn't really smell of anything.

Generally my partner puts it on me and then our clothes don't go back on for quite a while, so I can't really tell you what it does if you put clothes on immediately, but it's oil, so approach with caution. I don't think I've wrecked any clothes with it, and I did when I was using, for instance, hempseed oil.

Another quicker option is that I put on almond oil just before I get out of the shower, and that absorbs faster than putting it on dry skin. It's not as solidly moisturising as a body butter, but it's a quick and easy one, and again, doesn't seem to mess up my clothes.

I've got Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, I've had Dry Everything for years."
10fiigs,Viva HRT
10fiigs,"Vaseline after a shower while you‚Äôre still damp, not wet. Got rid of my alligator shins."
10fiigs,"I started HRT about a week ago and haven‚Äôt yet noticed a difference (I know, ‚Äúpatience grasshopper‚Äù). How long did it take for others to feel an effect?"
10fiigs,Smiling for you! It's a little scary how much it affects and it creeps up slowly. Until one day are losing it over a dropped spoon or something similarly silly and think this isnt right!
10fiigs,How long did it take you to feel back to normal?
10fiigs,Shall raise a cuppa tea in celebration for you!
10fiigs,It‚Äôs replacing what we are losing or have already lost.
10fiigs,"Never thought of it that way, but it certainly makes sense. Man made chemicals may replicate but never truly replace imo"
10fiigs,"Vintage collectable folk lol will check her out thank you. Have avoided make up as it sweats off easier, but then never really been a girlie girl for wearing it daily to know application techniques"
10fiigs,"Definitely ask your doctor about your options. Within the first 3 weeks could feel my inner smile coming back and not needing to sleep on a towel to absorb the sweat. Better sleep for not waking up during the night in a puddle. Menopause certainly needs to be talked about more to raise awareness. Admittedly it was odd to get the ""eat for England"" once a month again and put it down to the hrt giving me fake period symptoms, but hey, chocolate is medicinal....."
10fiigs,"I read there is a sensation of feeling like small insects crawling on the body. Made me question if I had fleas at first, but thanks to the internet learned it's a side effect. Thankfully gone now. Hair brushes are good for hitting the spot! I did suffer badly from eczema as a child but grew out of it. Perhaps it remains in the system, along with the teenage spots that sometimes occur now. There is logic in the eastern medicines working from the inside. Used to drink this herbal brew (smelt and tasted disgusting) but definitely helped with the eczema. Shall research more about yin foods, thank you!"
10fiigs,"Massive thank you! Will have a look. Not expecting a youthful glow,  just getting rid of the dry skin would be amazing. Embrace my character lines!"
10fiigs,Looks like some online shopping is my task today! Any excuse! Admittedly diet is pants for healthy stuff and do need to address that. Brought supplements then promptly forgot I had them to take them
10fiigs,"Thank you! Shall be online shopping today. Agree on the davina enlightenment. Doctor was ""useless"" and accepted my refusal without explaining, after test results showed I was in the thick of it. But grateful she then prescribed with no issue. Not blaming the doctor, just believe it needs more education about what the menopause effects"
10fiigs,"3 months compared to however many years/months you've been suffering for is nothing. And be better to find out what you need than given something generic.  Keep smiling, there is light at the end of the tunnel!"
10fiigs,"Thank you! Going to look online shopping today. Seems to be oils are the way forward and several have mentioned squalane, so going for that. Pity product companies dont make little samples rather than having to buy the ""larger"" pots, so dont feel so wasteful if it doesnt work"
10fiigs,Will try that. Have plenty which I havent used in a while....
10fiigs,"Friend in a similar position and has been having acupuncture as an alternative. She was told it doesnt  work for every one, however she seems to be perking up and not so erratic, not meant in an insulting way."
10fiigs,Guessing a large portion of fish and chips wont have the same effect sadly lol
10fiigs,Special clothes for the after oil application. Have several tshirts with damp looking patches from vicks vapour rub lol love the idea of homemade body butter. Got some some (not homemade) for Christmas and impressed at how quickly it absorbs
10fiigs,"Sleeping was better after about 3 weeks. It's the reverse gradual that you suddenly realise not hot flushing etc. Still have brain fog at times and lack of energy but putting that down to being off work and gotten lazy, opps"
10fiigs,Well we don't have much of a choice. Just like those whose bodies don't create insulin.
10fiigs,"Ohhh I‚Äôm so sweaty, I just feel dirty all the time (and definitely not in a fun way, that‚Äôs gone) ü§£
I‚Äôm on the waiting list for meno clinic, so looking forward to that. I‚Äôm eating for Wales every day of the month at the moment. I enjoyed the Davina programme as well, probably the first show I‚Äôve seen specifically about menopause üòä"
10fiigs,"Yeah, I don't have eczema but hives and stress related issues have been a lifelong skin problem. It runs in my family. My brother is itchy too! Without the hormone issues. MAYBE. ;) 

Topical stuff doesn't address any of my current issues. STUPES! :)"
10fiigs,I‚Äôve been using the CereVe moisturizing cream and the Aveeno lotion for eczema for my super dry skin üòÄ
10fiigs,Good on u. We gotta keep plugging away..this sub is exceptionally useful for hints what to do cos it seems like even the sympathetic Dr aren't too sure what they dealing with..I hope you get something nice !
10fiigs,"Here the facial oil i am using right now that‚Äôs made a real difference for me. Before this I was using la mer renewal oil which is also great but $270 gah

https://www.sephora.com/product/P484033

I think I‚Äôm Going to order the biossance vitamin c and rose moisturizer too since the oil is so good. Been using halo honey by farmacy or cream de la mer"
10fiigs,I haven‚Äôt even thought of that! Thank you!
10fiigs,"Well‚Ä¶ no. But it might be good for your mental health, at least for a little while. Especially if you are lucky enough to eat them near some water."
10fiigs,"I think you're meant to eat a portion of oily fish twice a week. I haven't a clue what actually counts as oily fish, I haven't eaten fish since I was three."
10fiigs,"Well, yeah, I often just stick on an old t-shirt.

I stock up on aloe butter, refined shea butter, and also refined cocoa butter (for the solid oil moisturiser) every now and again, it all lives on the top shelf of my fridge. Also coconut oil, you can just get a jar of extra virgin coconut oil from the supermarket. I think my moisturiser is just coconut oil and cocoa butter melted together, but I'm suddenly going totally blank, it feels like I'm missing something out. I used to add a little refined kokum butter, but haven't been able to get hold of it. Pity, it was amazing. Not everyone wants a solid oil facial moisturiser, though, and I imagine it may not play well with makeup. I don't really care if my face looks oily for a while in the morning."
10fiigs,"Thank you! I started 3 weeks ago!   I've enjoyed no more hot flashes, but I've yet to sleep through the night still.  My emotions are much stronger now too."
10fiigs,When you learn that the human body can sweat from places you didnt even know existed! Found womens anti perspirants weren't strong enough and now use mens
10fiigs,I became a sugar pig. Always had a sweet tooth but the cravings became somewhat alarming
10fiigs,"Yes on the CereVe moisturizing cream! It‚Äôs rich and yet not greasy or too thick. And I love that it has no scent or anything. Just a pure, clean moisture."
10fiigs,Woke up with my shins soaking wet once. My SHINS.
10fiigs,"I was never a big fan of sweet stuff until I was pregnant the first time, got into the habit of a little cake or biscuit in the afternoon‚Ä¶now I‚Äôm eating everything I can get my hands on. Definitely a comfort mechanism."
10fiigs,This made me proper laugh out loud! Thank you!
10fiigs,"Yeah I guess that's what it was. I was so uncomfortable all the time with the hot flashes, brain fog and a bunch of other symptoms. Sugar brought me comfort. I'm much better behaved now that I'm on HRT."
10iuaqa,Lume Acidified body wash and deodorant. You could also try persimmon soap. It can be found on Amazon.
10iuaqa,Are you using a panty liner in your undies? I‚Äôve been wearing one every day for a few years now.  I couldn‚Äôt stand the smell or the dampness especially in the summer.  I really think it has saved me
10iuaqa,"Buy underwear more frequently.  This is something I've had to do s/p hysterectomy & menopause.  Things change.  So our most intimate garments need a new cycle too if that makes sense?  Air out your lady parts, too, when you can.  I do a kind of modified child's pose on my bed sometimes after a shower just to feel fresher & feel like I've got some air to parts typically not as frequently aired-out.  I live alone but even if you don't you can take 5-10 minutes behind a closed door for this.  And just breathe & relax.  Refreshes your whole dang self!  üíúü¶Ñüëë"
10iuaqa,"If you mean vaginal odor and there is no bacterial infection present, you might want to check on your vaginal pH level and bring it down if it‚Äôs high. Localized vaginal estrogen can bring high pH down substantially and hyaluronic acid gel can bring it down moderately."
10iuaqa,No douching. Cotton underwear only. And I like to eat plain full fat yogurt and kefir daily. They contain several different kinds of probiotics which help keep the vaginal and gut environment more balanced. Try it!
10iuaqa,Try Lume [Deordorant](https://lumedeodorant.com). Safe to use ‚Äúdown there‚Äù
10iuaqa,I use Good Clean Love Restore gel. Game changer. It helps in balancing pH and keeps me from drying out. 10/10 recommend!
10iuaqa,"Do not douche it will only make things worse due to the normal acidity of 4.5 pH of the vagina. If they ruled out BV at the doctor‚Äôs appointment, consider Hyaluronic acid suppositories and if that helps, it‚Äôs vaginal dryness and HRT-estrogen specifically, can be helpful."
10iuaqa,[removed]
10iuaqa,Our body smells change in menopause.  It may just be that.  Not necessarily a problem.
10iuaqa,"Okay leave your vagina alone. Eat probiotics, in yoghurt and kombucha once or twice a week. Get a rock salt deodorant for external sweat and glandular smells. But your cooch should be left alone to recover the right ph/ acidity etc. cause she‚Äôs self cleaning‚Ä¶oh, and ditch the purfums and ‚Äúvaginal cleansers, they‚Äôre awful particularly trash the body wash shite.  Use something simple, goat milk soap or something mild."
10iuaqa,My sisters swear by Lume. They said it‚Äôs the ONLY thing that has worked.
10iuaqa,"All cotton underwear, no underwear at night. No douching and I use my face wash to wash my lady bits, Cetaphil gentle skin cleaner. I used to eat a lot of yogurt and recently switched to kefir and just started adding a bit of soy milk to my coffee. My bits get hot so I try to wear loose fitting clothes and natural fibers."
10iuaqa,I'd get a second opinion. Have you been tested for bv?
10iuaqa,I bought ‚Äúanti monkey butt‚Äù off Amazon
10iuaqa,"I changed my diet, always use a panty liner and for any breakthrough funk I use Monkey Butt powder."
10iuaqa,Use a boric acid capsule any time the smell is off. They‚Äôre easy to find you can even get them at target now
10iuaqa,Estrace helps a lot with that
10iuaqa,"Premarin helps. BV? Drinking Baking and water can help ph level. UTI? 

Edit: spelling"
10iuaqa,"I have found a hand sanitizer (with a protective barrier it says)  that a client of mine produces, as soon as someone gets out of the bathroom, I will go see what its active ingredient is‚Ä¶ I apply it to my armpits and lady bits, zero odor."
10iuaqa,"I always used Summers eve wash for down there, but recently started mixing a little bit of the Dove baby wash (fragrance free) with a few drops of Dr Bronners tea tree oil soap which is made with other oils. I love the smell of tea tree oil and it‚Äôs naturally anti bacterial and anti fungal. I haven‚Äôt noticed any odor or anything different it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve tried. Good for post gym wash! ;)"
10iuaqa,Taking folic acid may help.
10iuaqa,Lume rocks! Totally safe. Love that stuff
10iuaqa,Down three wipes and wash by Good Wipes (Sold at Target) in Rosewater. Penny liners and cotton undies.
10iuaqa,"Second all of the above : cotton and linen underpants, go without underwear and wear wide pants for airing whenever possible, soap-less sensitive skin wetwipes in my bag wherever I go, dont use soap etc while washing too often because soap could throw off natural skin balance and make odors worse (salt based washes work better for me, like Zarqa)"
10iuaqa,"Personally, I use dog shampoo with ketoconazole in it. It's stopped the odor and stopped me from getting BV and yeast infections. I used to get BV every time my period ended and yeast infections due to type 2 diabetes. It's been months, and so far no odor, BV, or yeast infections."
10iuaqa,I experienced an odor from vaginal dryness. Luvena cleared it up.
10iuaqa,Vagifem or estrace. Both keep everything from being super dry. I didn‚Äôt have any moisture on the outside at all and vagina estrogen saved the day! I never had a problem with that until menopause. Now everything is back to normal. Thank god!
10iuaqa,I like the product RePhresh
10iuaqa,"I swear by hibiscus tea (drinking not douching, haha). Vag health probiotic, as much cotton as I can get away with but I do that anyway as synthetic fabrics can irritate my inner thighs."
10iuaqa,I'm on vaginal Estrogen 2 times a week and I use Boric Acid tabs once a week for maintenance and it's really helped.
10iuaqa,"I agree with some of the others about panty liners, they often make matters worse for me, but I'm one of those that needs a layer of fabric. If I go commando it actually doesn't help me. Plain ole 100% cotton underwear helps with that dampness and moistness and odor for me. And the boric acid suppository, as needed, typically once a month. I NEVER DOUCHE. Ever. It just messes with the beautiful ""biome"" us ladies have. And taking a probiotic everyday, eating yogurt and kefir, drinking kombucha, and drinking lots of water."
10iuaqa,Green tea first thing in the morning
10iuaqa,Lume saved me! I LOVE that stuff!
10iuaqa,Mirai persimmon wash is good too.
10iuaqa,"Yes, I'm using the lavendar stuff. Works well!"
10iuaqa,Totally agree with the liner. It makes a huge difference.
10iuaqa,Or use a hair dryer!
10iuaqa,Or use a hair dryer!
10iuaqa,Me too!  Love this product.
10iuaqa,I would not use boric acid on human skin
10iuaqa,Second probiotics but I would also take them in pill form. Costco sells probiotics for women that are reasonably priced.
10iuaqa,Agreed!
10iuaqa,They are life changing!
10iuaqa,They are life changing!
10iuaqa,Please don't use Premarin. It is derived from pregnant mare's urine. The foals are often sold to meat buyers.
10iuaqa,I would not advise putting hand sanitizer on your vagina.
10iuaqa,"Ladies, for the love of God, *do not* put essential oils on your genitalia. It is way too sensitive for this kind of treatment. Trapped bacteria cause the odor, so if you feel smelly, wash (just the pubic area) multiple times a day, as needed, with your regular body soap."
10iuaqa,Lume: tell me more
10iuaqa,"I switched to Knix, not gonna lie, ‚Äúcharcoal filter ‚Äú underwear, basically. No more Yeast, and my jeans don‚Äôt get stinky. To each her own, I guess."
10iuaqa,"Panty liners decrease airflow which contribute to a dark, moist environment. Bacteria love this. I'd suggest that the OP go without underwear as much as possible to help."
10iuaqa,They come as capsules and it is definitely a thing.
10iuaqa,It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm putting straight essential oils on my vagina! This very diluted solution is just fine. It doesn‚Äôt burn obvi or I wouldn‚Äôt be using it. When you say ‚Äúregular body soap‚Äù what on earth do you mean? Because If it‚Äôs Dial or some crap like that - now THAT will burn. Maybe Cetaphil would be a good choice as far as body soaps.
10iuaqa,"It's a line of ""deodorants"" and soaps that seem to stop any smell before it happens. I have always been a sweaty person and I sware I could take three showers a day and still feel icky between my legs. Been checked out for infection and all that - changed diet. Never made a difference. This stuff if magical! Search Lume on amazon or you can buy from their website too. I love the stuff! You can literally use it anywhere on the body - which is why I like it."
10iuaqa,I gotta get a pair!
10iuaqa,I have noticed more irritation when I wear one at night so I make sure not to.  But during the day...heck yeah.  Better than the stress of thinking I'm leaking fluids all over the place.
10iuaqa,"Yes. I go ‚Äòcommando‚Äô as much as possible- when home and even a trip to the supermarket etc. 

I also do a boric acid suppository once a month and don‚Äôt use soap products."
10iuaqa,"Yes and it is amazing!  Boric Life on Amazon, have been using them for 4 years to treat BV when i get it,  i use it every once in a while (once or twice a month) for housekeeping LOL.  My Dr. Was OK with it."
10iuaqa,"Firstly, someone could take what you wrote to mean that it‚Äôs ok to use tea tree oil on their public area/vulva, since it has antibacterial properties. Let‚Äôs not pretend like we‚Äôve never read something in a comment section and thought ¬´¬†great, I‚Äôll try this shortcut, that should work¬†¬ª. So I‚Äôm making it very clear that it‚Äôs a very bad idea. 

Secondly, I‚Äôm dispelling the notion that we need some kind of special mixture to clean the pubic area ¬´¬†more efficiently¬†¬ª. We do not. 

This is a marketing ploy used by the beauty industry to sell women useless products. 

Whatever gentle, skin-friendly soap you use to wash the rest of your body, is perfectly fine there as well.*That* is what I call regular soap. And for the record, I have no ideal what ¬´¬†Dial¬†¬ª is."
10iuaqa,I use a tea tree wash then a tea tree gel. It really helps and it's designed for that area so it doesn't burn my flaps off.
10iuaqa,Thank you my dear! On it!
10iuaqa,"I don't leak anything anymore. So, going without underwear can be a choice I make. Sometimes I forget to put on underwear. Nothing us coming out of me, though. So, I don't have to worry. That feels very freeing."
10iuaqa,"Oh, and 100% cotton underwear!"
10iuaqa,I love tea tree oil based products they are wonderful! I also use a tea tree oil eyelid wipe (made by Occusoft just for the eyes as a disclaimer lol) for my blepharitis. It‚Äôs a miracle for me.
10iuaqa,But still odor or no? I'm wondering if the smell is coming from the fluid created...or sweat maybe?
10iuaqa,Are you asking me about odor? I have no odor complaints.
10odrvs,"I'll tell you what you know: you have too much to do and it's erasing you.

If your kids are over the age of eight, pull back, and if there's another parent there hand some of the work to that person, also some back to the kids. You're Gen X, you know it's possible to grow up without massive management. Do not listen to the professional moms who spend their lives anxious about what other people will think about the state of their food containers bc apparently it's not fine to just leave food in the packaging it came in, you have to have a pretend Victorian cereal shop. For real, my kid knows that I'm busy because I'm supporting us and because I'm a person, and while I'm there for the big management things, when it comes to an awful lot, she's known that there are things she can take care of. Which has paid off immensely, by her own report: she just marshalled her friends into renting their first apartment, spent a month last summer on scholarship in Europe on her own, finds things she wants to do and does them, is happy with others but also with her own company.

You can be pretty 1970s about it. I did not chauffeur my kid all around to activities: once she was old enough to ride a bus and a bike, if she wanted to do an activity or job that involved transportation, she had to consider how she was getting back and forth. (She now isn't all that interested in car ownership, doesn't see the point of the expense.) If you have multiple kids and they're refusing to clean up after themselves, at least make it easy: the environment can come second to your sanity for a few years, tell them they're using paper plates only and are not allowed to have food in their rooms or in any carpeted area, kitchen only. 

Once you've handed them and their other parent back some of their lives, get some sleep, because odds are excellent that your lack of motivation is tied to lack of sleep. Make sure the family respects your sleep as an important thing and that you're not to be disturbed while sleeping unless someone's bleeding or on fire."
10odrvs,"I've successfully worked in an afternoon or more likely evening walk most days. I'll usually do it right before dinner, between prepping the meal and actually cooking. I made a goal to get outside for a 5 minute walk every day. Five minutes is totally doable on days that time is crunched, and if I have the time and the weather isn't awful, I usually get 15-30 minutes in, but 5 minutes counts as success. I'll shout out to the kids that I'm going for a quick walk and does anyone want to go. Usually at least one wants some fresh air too (they're 10 and 18). If not, I go alone. It's nice either way, to clear my head or get some uninterrupted time with a kid for a minute. I'm still working on getting a real block of exercise time in, but this has made a difference for me."
10odrvs,I just want to extend a hug and pat on the back to all you women that are doing jobs and childcare and eldercare while going thru this ordeal.  You are warrior queens.
10odrvs,"I focus on moving regularly throughout the day.  I do a 'formal' 20 minute workout with a youtuber, then later I may do some hip/back stretches/bridges, etc.  If I go into my laundry room where the freezer is, I'll do 20 incline pushups off the freezer.  While I'm standing at the sink, I'll practice my balance."
10odrvs,"I‚Äôm exercising more than being because if I don‚Äôt I feel way too awful and stiff.   I‚Äôm a Pilates teacher and have always been fit and active.  Upon menopause I gained a sudden 20 pounds and then over a year 10 more keeps up.  I‚Äôm changing my diet and exercising more and not losing a damn pound       If I don‚Äôt keep up with exercise I‚Äôll maybe keep gaining and I just can‚Äôt deal with that.    

It is hard to get started.  I know, I fell into deep depression when I first hit menopause.  Just start small and build from there.  Go for short walks.  Do 10 minutes of some exercises at home everyday.   Once you start doing some you will likely feel like doing a little more."
10odrvs,"I just stopped trying to do everything. I do my best. In the winter, I‚Äôve figured out this year, my achievable best isn‚Äôt quite good enough and I feel worse for a time. I simply do not have the time capacity to do anything about that and I can‚Äôt control the northern hemisphere environment. As long as I‚Äôm mostly staying on Amber traffic light rating that has to be good enough. My strategies, fwiw: frequent hot drinks; comforting blankets at all times indoors; warm socks; zinc supplements; only yoga for exercise; walk in daylight; using Daylio to check I‚Äôm not sliding into the Red zone; massage therapy; knitting for my mental health and oxytocin."
10odrvs,"I take naps.  It seems crazy to nap for an hour or so after work or a quick snooze at lunch, but I get the rest of my evening back when I do, instead of just dragging my ass all night dying to go to bed.   I put on a podcast I don‚Äôt care that much about and a timer."
10odrvs,"Even 15 minutes yoga/Pilates/stretching counts for something. Wear your Fitbit as you do house chores and you will be surprised at how many steps you take in a day. Then take it as a challenge to increase them. And on days you don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, enjoy your rest with wine/chocolate or whatever makes you happy ü•Ç"
10odrvs,"Homeschool my 13yo; own a business; research, script, record, and edit a podcast weekly; volunteer as a living history interpreter twice a month (something my daughter wanted us to do, and it can count towards school); tend to the house; and I work out five days a week. My daughter and my husband contribute to taking care of our home, but the lion's share of the mental burden of family is on me. And I'm in peri.

In 2016, I wanted to lose some weight so I started walking. At the same time, I had something mental going on but I didn't know what it was. I walked to try to escape it. In 2018 I was diagnosed with anxiety, and I started yoga. In early 2016, I had to rehab a knee injury and started lifting weights in between sets of rehab exercises. Now I practice hatha and deep stretch yoga, do cardio twice a week, and weight train one. I'm learning tai chi and qigong to switch up with one of the yogas.

Taking this time to take care of my body, mind, and spirit helps me be better everywhere else. I'm healthier than I've been in decades so I'm physically capable of doing all I need to do. By tending to my spirit, I'm able to be more present to my family while managing my anxiety. If necessary, someone will make dinner while I'm working out, or at least start it. I insist on team work making the dream work, and their options are to work with me or I go on strike. (Godfather approach: I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.)"
10odrvs,"To be honest, I am not. 3 years ago, I was a ripped gym bunny who did 6 day workouts, could deadlift 130kg for 8-10 reps, wieked as a truck mechani, ferried my boys around, found time to do the odd road trip, went into the city to see the art gallery and could not eat enough, even with 3000cal a day. 

Now, once I went GF after being diagnosed Coeliac, I barely go to the gym, spend pretty much all weekend curled up sleeping and listening to podcasts or reading, make excuses to not socialise at all and all I want is stillness, peace, quiet and gentle flow of each day. 

I wore myself out after years and years forcing myself to just move forward. I think my cells were so damaged and exhausted from being on the go, under fuelled and pushed beyond the norm. 

It might just be time to be kind, patient and healing on yourself. I am sure it isn't simply laziness. Healing can take a long, long time."
10odrvs,"No clue. It rained here all day yesterday, I had a lot of little stuff to do inside, did do a fucking thing. Kids & hubs played on the computer all day. I doom scrolled & watched reruns."
10odrvs,"This is so helpful, inexpensive, and workouts are 15 min. Staff is body positive and very supportive with intuitive eating nutritionists and a PT on staff and they are all accessible to you. https://mommastrong.com/"
10odrvs,"It's so easy for us all to encourage & support each other in slowing down, saying no, making time for self-care, etc.  And so hard to do...ugh!!!  Stay moisturized & hydrated & plz consider blood work from your NP/PCP to check iron, vitamin levels, etc.  Find the moments when you can & don't fight what you can't win i.e. sleeplessness.  Don't fight to get to sleep.  Relax in the stillness & daydream about things that bring you joy & peace.  Breathe.  Deeply.  Waiting in line, in your car, on hold on the phone, etc.  And when you find yourself enjoying something or someone just enjoy it!  Don't rush to take pics & post, etc.  Be in that moment.  Some days we're all defeated before a toe touches the floor.  On other days we get a warm & wonderful 2nd wind.  Be gentle with yourself, dear one!üíúü¶Ñüëë"
10odrvs,"I don't have kids and I only cook breakfast. The rest of my meals are either canteen, ready made or frozen veggies with meat. I work 42 hours a week.

I lift weights 3 times a week, it takes only half an hour on the ""circle"" of 6 machines. Then I do bike for 15 minutes. I go Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays because those are the days when then gym is most empty."
10odrvs,"I am a single parent to 2 younger kids, an executive, in peri, and I live in Canada so I get deep winter. My number 1 advice to other parents, who often complain about being too busy, is: You have the right to set your own standards. You don't have to do crafts and make all food from scratch. You are allowed to lay on the sofa with your kids in the evening and leave the dishes till later. Let the kids watch cartoons while you do 30 minutes of yoga. My kids are well balanced and smart and I am talk to them about how I need time for myself too. 

Some things I do to take care of myself: 15 minutes of yoga a day (in the morning before I wake up the kids). Walk to and from train station to commute to work, adding 40 minutes of walking per day. Get my hair done every six weeks and get botox, because I want to and it makes me feel beautiful. Buy some meals from Costco that just need heating up so on kids activity nights I don't start from scratch. Hire a babysitter once every two weeks so I can go on a date/see my friends for drinks. Take melatonin and CBD every night to get good sleep. Order groceries online and get them delivered. 

I know I am type A and having a packed schedule works for me, I know it doesn't for everyone. But definitely make time for things that make you happy!! Even if it's just lighting some candles, having a bath and a glass of wine."
10odrvs,How many upvotes can I give this? It echos a podcast I listened to yesterday.
10odrvs,I don't have kids but I love this so much.  Thank you.  This speaks to my heart.
10odrvs,"My guess is there is no other parent, or does it matter? I feel the exact same way with no other parent. Sleep is not an option it just does not happen anymore."
10odrvs,"This this this this this.

Your exhaustion and flatness are your body and mind saying enough."
10odrvs,"Love this sage advice!!!  I parent in much the same fashion‚Äî no clucking, just supporting and my kids understand that I bring home the bacon while I love them. All 3 are getting to various stages of self sufficiency‚Äî the biggest gift I can give them outside my unconditional love and support."
10odrvs,"The Victoria cereal shop!! For real, people spend so much time on shit like that and it doesn't matter. Unless it brings you joy, of course. I very much agree with you, and the research backs it up: one of the keys to raising successful kids is to teach them how to be independent and how to be resilient."
10odrvs,"Me too. I thought it was depression or COVID stir-craziness but it‚Äôs just menopause and i am exhausted at 3-4 pm every day and need to sleep for an hour. Menopause symptoms include me waking every night at 1 or 3 or 4, so i have to recover some sleep. Now it‚Äôs a cycle I cant seem to get out of."
10odrvs,"Healing can take a long time. I had not considered that one. However obvious it seems, ... Thank you for stating that one. Pushed beyond the norm also really resonates with me.   
Stillness, peace, quiet, gentle flow of the day. This to me sounds like absolute bliss. I too aim for this, and thankfully, I mostly have it too. It IS healing."
10odrvs,"Agreed, this post is amazing."
10odrvs,What was the name of the podcast episode?
10odrvs,"We Can Do Hard Things
Overwhelm
June 15, 2021"
10odrvs,Thank you for sharing!
10iryc2,"That is a lot.  Some of those things feel hard because they are actually really fucking hard things to deal with and anyone else in your shoes would likely struggle with any one of them.

Meno stuff makes coping with everything else so much harder."
10iryc2,"Well, here's taking my hat off to you. I am not menopausal but also have a whole list of health issues; autoimmune and otherwise, and f\*\*\* me, brain fog + tiredness + health issues + money worries =  a very particular, and incredibly difficult type of misery. Sounds like you are really trying to help yourself and i sincerely admire that. The responsibilities you have are significant; and being weighted by emotional difficulties which impact even the hardest of humans means you are allowed to be 'super whiny' and be heard. Not whining (that's something my kids do); just exasperated by the sounds of it. I'm so sorry i haven't any helpful advice (i know lots of people often talk of meditation and mindfulness - though personally, ive also found it hard with fog and financial misery), but the fact you are trying to help yourself; that you have come to a safe place to vent; well here is sending supportive love and admiration."
10iryc2,"Sending a virtual hug your way.   My list isn‚Äôt as bad as yours but there are days I struggle to even want to do anything.  So vent away if it helps, blast some music, do what ever you need to do to make things a little less overwhelming.  We have all been there done that one way or another."
10iryc2,"Does menopause do something to perception of time? I have my own list of demons, but I don't work and I can't get shit done. I don't have time. I'm always racing against the clock to just get through the day to restart and do the same thing the next day. I'm trying to add a block of time for exercising back into my schedule, but seriously struggling to squeeze it in consistently. Pre-meno, I had no trouble managing all the have-to things to do and managed to have leisure time as well. What the hell happened? I'm also terrified because I'm still young, still have kids at home, and I've got things to do! I can't retire to a rocking chair forever yet and I can't go on feeling overwhelmed 24/7. It's exhausting."
10iryc2,"I don‚Äôt even have all that on my plate and every day feels hard! I am doing this feelings tracker app and I wish there was a ‚Äúditto‚Äù
Button from the day before and I feel that sense of dread as well that it won‚Äôt get better. I have been trying to turn more to God in this time and make him more a part of my day to get through it. Hang in there."
10iryc2,"You‚Äôve got a lot going on!  You‚Äôd be superhuman to not be impacted by that. 

HRT helped me so much with brain fog and fatigue (testosterone helps the most with the brain fog imo). 

I lost my dad 2 years ago- it takes a long time to heal from that, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself."
10iryc2,"I can‚Äôt give you any words of wisdom but I would crack up with a tenth of your stuff. 
Sending a virtual HUG üíï"
10iryc2,"HUGS. Everything is just overwhelming to me. I feel your pain. Some of your issues that we deal with as well. I‚Äôve turned to MMJ and it‚Äôs helped me so much.  But that‚Äôs me.  
 Sadly I need a solid routine or I sink down low. 

HUGS"
10iryc2,"I just recently took it into my own hands and started hrt, through an online company, you can DM me if you‚Äôd like to know more, basically a big game changer, after dealing with said demons for the past 2 long years. Sending a hug, it can get better!"
10iryc2,"How's your sleep? Not sleeping well makes everything harder. 

But yes totally relate on all of this. I love my parents but the degenerative diseases are cruel. I wish I could transform my parents into additional children somehow where they get steadily more capable instead of less."
10iryc2,That is a tough thing to go through.
10iryc2,"Wow. Feel free to vent away, we are here for you. Sending big hugs! Sounds to me like you are doing all that you can, in a positive way. Kudos. It is a tremendous amount for anyone. 

No wonder you feel like crap. I wish I could send you relief. Virtual sympathy and understanding is all I have. Nevertheless,  I am glad you reached out."
10iryc2,"Oh! You have such a lot on your plate. It is so much that is demanded of us. And we get such little support ourselves. I hope you can make some time for yourself in some way, even if it‚Äôs just a walk or a cup of coffee.

Sending you a hug."
10iryc2,More power your way in your struggle. Looking into yoga‚Ä¶ Yoga with Adriene is AWESOME. It‚Äôs the little break that I get almost every day. That mat is YOUR time. Sending hugs!
10iryc2,[deleted]
10iryc2,Truth.
10iryc2,i love you.  Thank you.  I admire YOU & your compassion!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
10iryc2,"Thanks.  This is why i vented here- to get solidarity!  I totally blast music, get outside whenever i can (when I‚Äôm not exhausted or busy!) and meditate.  What do you do to overcome your daily struggles? Does it work?  I‚Äôll try anything!"
10iryc2,"THIS THIS THIS YES!!!!   This is exactly how i feel.  Excellently put, about the racing against the clock & restarting daily!"
10iryc2,Thank you. üíö
10iryc2,"Thank you, and sorry for your loss too!üñ§üñ§"
10iryc2,Thank you!!!  I‚Äôll take the virtual hugs!üíô
10iryc2,"Yes, i do find that if i try to diverge from a routine, life goes extra haywire.  üòñ"
10iryc2,"Virtual sympathy and understanding means everything bc it makes me feel like my exhaustion and difficulties life-ing might actually be justified instead of demonstrating my lack of fortitude.  So thank you, seriously.  üíñ"
10iryc2,I really needed that hug today.  I was up from 12-4:30 a.m. for no frickin reason and then up by 7:30 to do a 9 a.m. meeting.  I‚Äôm fried but have work to do and another meeting this afternoon. Gonna try to rest an hour now.  Fuck!  How do people do life????
10iryc2,"I‚Äôm paying myself a nominal amount that pretty much goes back into family activities with my mom.  She‚Äôs not disabled but is cognitively declining and not able to do a lot physically anymore, though pretty healthy overall.  She has funds to live on but i feel super guilty with the idea of taking her money."
10iryc2,"Ahh, well i'm an emotional mess for similar reasons to your own struggles, and that's just got me!! <3 Thank YOU! Funnily enough, this is my first experience of reddit (signed up tonight)- i've never entertained forums etc before and bloody hell, so glad i have. Your post really got me. Also, if it's of any consolation at all, i know many people whom feel the same as you (and massively in part, I), but they are -like many- completely useless in even being able to articulate it. You're a rare egg. For sure. As i said above, your venting here is something that shines through with such light. Sinerely, sending all the best. And if i ever hear of a magic pill, i'll send it to you first <3"
10iryc2,"I blast music, squeeze a squish mellow (stress ball), hug my daughter/hubby, focus on one task at a time and if none of that works‚Ä¶.I grab a Delta 8 gummy.  A full one will knock me on my ass so I can sleep and half one will help control my pain levels from my joint pain/arthritis."
10iryc2,"I‚Äôve always been an anxious person and I Dr for it. However lately, I feel off.  There has been a lot of added stresses so that I‚Äôm sure is contributing to my stupidness.  I messed up at work last week. Cannot focus. Easily distracted, etc. something I had a feeling was happening and it was brought to my attention.  I always go with my gut. So I‚Äôve obsessed more then I probably need to however past toxic employment.  

I feel like my entire inside has changed and everything seems off."
10iryc2,You are certainly welcome‚ù£Ô∏è
10iryc2,"Beats me, have a coffee if I can find the filter and a burnt cookie üôÇ"
10iryc2,"Oh i really do love you. üòç. You‚Äôre a sweetheart.  I know so many of us on this sub feel similarly, so this is an awesome place to vent & get advice.  There‚Äôs no negative consequences to asking for advice here, and the more people share, the more we can collectively normalize this shit and fkn EDUCATE the general population.  Rock on, my sister.  ‚úäüèΩ"
10iryc2,Now THAT is a good idea.  I keep hearing about delta 8 gummies.
10iryc2,"Right back at you with the love! <3 And thank you! Honestly, wish i'd got to this sooner. Always known about reddit (forums, generally) but never realised until tonight what a wonder of compassion and understanding they really are. Who knew there could be such light in the dark! Tried to follow you but i haven't enough 'karma' lol. What a wonderful first experience, and interaction, thank you \*so\* much. Really excited to be delving into all of this. Truly hoping things 'let up' a bit for you as immediately as possible! xx"
111u1re,"Oh gosh that sounds like vaginal atrophy, and it's completely treatable. 

When estrogen declines, the vaginal tissue dries out and thins and becomes prone to tears and chafing - even just from walking around! Penetration feels like knives. It's the very symptom that sent me to the gynecologist in the first place, not realizing what it was or that it was a very normal symptom of peri!! 

My first gyn was a man and I told him that I was on vacation with my partner and between one moment and the next, sex was suddenly incredible painful, like broken glass painful, and that peeing after was excruciating. That gyn recommended I see a psychologist/sex therapist. I was like how did I suddenly get psychological sex issues between morning sex and afternoon sex? Morning sex was great, hours later it was excruciating and you're telling me that developed in my psyche between morning sex and a nooner? Seriously??? 

So I went to a second gyn and she told me it's called vaginal atrophy, it's normal, it's a function of estrogen loss and it's treatable - and she prescribed 0.01% estrogen vaginal cream. It takes two weeks or more of constant use to repair your vaginal tissue, and then maintenance use of 2 or 3x a week after that. Slowly the vaginal bacterial community will also get healthier and vaginal tissue pain will diminish (in my case it's totally gone) and also any feelings of urinary pain, UTIs, and the need to pee when you barely have anything in your bladder. 

Anyway this is one of the few parts of peri that are so treatable! Don't go through vaginal pain if you don't have to. The estrogen in the cream doesn't make it into the rest of your body so it's not considered HRT and it doesn't come with neg side effects for most women. It's messy, so the two weeks or more of repair can be gross, but then they also make little insertable pills that can be used a few times a week for maintenance and they aren't messy at all. I didn't find they worked very well for the first 'repair' phase, but they are great for maintaining vaginal health for me. 

Most doctors will prescribe vaginal estrogen even if they are out of touch about HRT."
111u1re,"Sounds like you need estrogen suppositories 
Def read through this sub 
Find another gyn and go in armed w print outs and know exactly what you want prescribed
Going through this myself 
Good luck"
111u1re,"If you're experiencing vaginal pain, then you want to investigate that...you may have vaginal atrophy which is highly treatable."
111u1re,My daughter and I use period proof underwear as she can‚Äôt use tampons or pads.  I find they leak less and are worth the cost since they are reusable.
111u1re,"Take a look at the Rael Organic Cotton Pads (sold at Target).    I think I bled for 8 months straight at one time, and I was either wearing a panti liner or a pad at all times.   Pads like Always are horrible.  That plastic makes you feel like your vagina lives in the Mississippi River Basin.   The Rael are all organic cotton.    If you can't find those the U by Kotex aren't bad."
111u1re,I hadn't realised how far down the path of vaginal atrophy I was until I got some cream and Oh em Gee! It's amazing. Seriously get a better doctor or buy something online.
111u1re,"Everyone else gave great advice at the time of writing, but I think a cup could be ok as long as you aren‚Äôt allergic to whatever the material is. I also really liked period underwear, didn‚Äôt feel as wet as pads."
111u1re,"From a post earlier this year

https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/u9waxz/menstrual\_disks\_are\_amazing/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3"
111u1re,"Just wanted to say all of your Covid related flow issues I‚Äôve had too. Makes it very confusing as to what‚Äôs going on.  I did go to the doc and they did a internal ultrasound and could see small fibroids but honestly nothing really pointed to them causing the issue.  

I use a cup and some days it does feel more irritating.  I‚Äôve found rinsing it in water so it‚Äôs not dry going in is helpful.  Also applying some lube you like can be helpful."
111u1re,"It's pathetic how uninformed doctors are about menopause. The women in this sub can read your post and instantly know what the problem is and how to fix it. Meanwhile, actual doctors are clueless. I had vaginal atrophy but didn't realize it. I have plenty of natural lubricant (sometimes a bit too much when I am aroused), and my tissues look pink and healthy. Toilet paper started being painful to use, and I was getting tiny little cysts called inclusion cysts. I thought it might be from low estrogen, so I tried an otc bi-est cream and it was miraculous!
The pain and the cysts went away immediately."
111u1re,"OMG, who knew. That sounds so great! I've been having trouble with utis as well, would be nice to have that go away, and needing to pee all the time! Why don't doctors and gynes tell you these things!

I was at the supplement store and a woman came in practically in tears begging the person working there for something to take for hot flashes and other symptoms, as she couldn't find a helpful gyne (I feel a bit better now that it's not so easy, people were making out like it was my fault somehow, it's just difficult). I tried to tell her about histamine, and maybe eating a low histamine diet may help. 

Doctors know nothing about this either! I was starting to get hot flashes and eating lower histamine foods helped a lot. But I'm sure there's other stuff going on that's at the root of it that I don't know. I've been having digestive issues for a couple decades, at first I thought I should just avoid foods, like dairy eggs and gluten, but in recent years I'm having more and more reactions. And trying to figure out what's going on with it! It's really been hard to process any information these days, and discern what is real and what is woo/misinformation, I've read about about SIBO and MCAS (something to do with mast cells that I don't quite understand yet). 

It's confusing too because I get both better and worse when I eat more fiber and take probiotics. I get more bloated but less constipated.

I hope the next gyne I see will be helpful! I'm going to see if I can find a different one this year. It's kinda hard to get visits with gynes, there are few on my plan and it takes months to get an appointment. If I have to follow up it will be months in between. Ugh. I've been putting it off.

I'm kinda anxious about it as it seems I have allergic reactions to everything these days. A few weeks ago had a rash in response to adhesive and since then I keep getting rashes for no reason. PEG is a no go and it's in a lot of things. I try to avoid it in skin products, but it seems the major reaction is when it's internal (like a vaccine or medication). So I'm not sure about the creams. I really hope something works out!

Thanks for replying, it was very helpful and kind. I really needed kind words today!"
111u1re,"I know bodies are different, but do you have a brand you like?"
111u1re,Bamboody have been reliable for me.
111u1re,"OMG that is horrible! 

Thanks for the tip about the cotton pads, I will try them! I think it could be a good stop gap between now and figuring out what kind of period underwear might work out."
111u1re,Also vote for a Diva Cup!  Game changer.
111u1re,"Ok, so it does sound like period underwear feels less icky at least. That is not to say that sustainability is at the back of my mind, however there are always pluses and minuses (such as the materials used in period underwear have come into question, I guess it's not as well regulated as pads at this point)."
111u1re,Thanks for the link!
111u1re,"It's good to not be alone! I did see someone talk about how vaccines were researched after enough woman brought it to their attention, and that took quite a lot of women refusing to be ignored before they looked into it, but covid itself has not been investigated."
111u1re,"+1 for period underwear. I really like Modibodi. They are expensive but what i did was build my collection a few pairs at a time, starting with those for heaviest flow. I do use a cup sometimes for my heaviest day as well, but for comfort decent period underwear is well worth it."
111u1re,Check out the r/periodunderwear sub for some great info!
111u1re,THINX brand works for her because of the material it‚Äôs made out of.  I buy them off Amazon.
111u1re,"I like thinx, the cotton options. I have only got two pairs so far, but fully intend to increase my collection! Used a diva cup for years, but find I like. Underwear even better. It's especially great because you can wear it on days when maybe you're going to get your period, maybe you're not? Don't have to worry about it

Also you could potentially try organic cotton tampons. I found it regular tampons made me cramp like crazy, and I think it was the bleach they were treated with."
111u1re,Yeah when my first issues began it was after the first shot and no one would listen and there was like three articles I found online.
111u1re,"I will check them out as well, thanks for the rec!"

10vcgwr,"I heard the slang term, ‚ÄúHemotional‚Äù earlier today. (As in ‚ÄúHe‚Äù is ‚Äúemotional‚Äù.) 

It seems to be used to indicate a man who lacks control over himself when a situation prompts an emotional response. (*Mental picture example: the man who smashes things in his home when his football team loses, while his wife and children sit quietly and witness it.*)

These distressed husbands and impatient physicians must have been very *hemotional*, to react to the women who needed and trusted them, so savagely and unprofessionally."
10vcgwr,"I just started reading The Woman They Could Not Silence, about a 43-year-old woman who was involuntarily committed to an asylum in 1860! Similar themes, I bet. Lock those pesky middle aged women away from the rest of the world! The menfolk are getting annoyed with them."

10qxpbt,"I do IF as it's habit at this point...and while it does help with weight loss, it's not a weight loss regime in of itself.  We also still have to watch what we eat  

Perhaps you need to start off more slowly...start doing 12:12 for a week or so, and then increase the time to 14:10, do that for a while and then 16:8."
10qxpbt,"When I started menopause I got super sensitive to dehydration and low blood sugar. Not diagnosed, just how it was. I could no longer wake up, hop in the car and go somewhere for fear of the results of either of those 2 issues. Dehydration would cause lightheadedness. A few times without thinking about anything going to shop for groceries, get in there and get super weak and dizzy. Thankfully my husband was there and he got me to a drive through for a taco or something. It took an hour or so before I recovered. Not that bad now but because of those incidents I usually grab something to eat before I go somewhere. It has to have protein with it because that doesnt drop the blood sugar. Like lunchmeat or an egg. For the dehydration Id drink a gatorade."
10qxpbt,"I've been fasting for years and have no issues going 16+ hours to 3+ days as long as I mind my fluids and electrolytes. However you shouldn't just start off with a 16 hour fast if you are not accustomed to it. It took me a couple months to work up to consistent, safe, and comfortable fasting. I started with 12 hour fasts as this time is mostly while sleeping and easily accomplished by merely sleeping in late on a weekend or skipping breakfast. Then I worked up with additional 2 hour increments. Eventually I never felt the energy crashes or fatigue anymore.  I fast 16-20 hours every day now along with regular extended fasts every other week or so of 36+ hours."
10qxpbt,"And/or electrolyte imbalance. Salt, magnesium and  potassium might help. I remember that garbage feeling, it‚Äôs horrible. Lite Salt in some ice water is a cheap electrolyte mix hack. It has sodium and potassium."
10qxpbt,I second the other comment about electrolytes but also you have to be off the sugar roller coaster. Any concentrated sweets during your non-fasting time will cause you to crash‚Ä¶
10qxpbt,"It does for me if I'm hormonal, or run down, or sick.

I've been doing it for about 7 years and it's always worked well, but now that I'm in perimenopause, and especially after having Long Covid, I have to be very, very careful. It does seem to stress my system more easily."
10qxpbt,"My experience with IF and weight loss : We have two large glasses of green smoothie around 2pm.  This smoothie has changed my life and altered all of my food cravings.  I no longer crave carbs or sugars.  Our evening meal is usually something quite light and if we feel the need we will add a fruit smoothie to round off the night.  

For me, it was about feeding my body what it needs and then just seeing what happens.  If you would like my recipe - let me know.  :) 

FEED YOUR BODY! And be kind to you."
10qxpbt,"I‚Äôve not had a problem with it. I sometimes even go for a run at the start of my fasting window and am able to get through it. It may be that your fasting window is surfacing another issue you might have. For example, if you‚Äôre not getting enough sleep at night, I could see this making IF intolerable."
10qxpbt,"Sounds like it‚Äôs time to get checked to rule out reactive hypoglycemia. I have it, and the only advice they gave me is eat a meal or snack every 2-3 hours. So obviously IF and hypoglycemia don‚Äôt mix well."
10qxpbt,"Has anyone here ever had visual disturbances because if it? Like an ocular migraine? No pain, just flashing and zigzags."
10qxpbt,"I  have tried this and had similar results.  I was told that it would eventually go away but I did it for a week and it never did and that was the total time I could tolerate it.   I have a very stressful job with long hours and this did not go well. I have always been the type of person that gets like this if I don‚Äôt eat my whole life.  Fasting bloodwork is a nightmare for me.

For the first time ever yesterday I saw a new doctor and she suggested intermittent fasting because of course this is the solution for every woman in menopause and peri it seems to be pushed a lot.    I explained to her the above and she took a look at my glucose from the fast bloodwork for the past three years, one I just had.  And she said that mine was on the lower end and this likely would explain why I may start to feel like this when I did not eat.      She said it was unlikely that intermittent fasting would be tolerable for me.    So just a thought."
10qxpbt,I can't fast either. Low blood sugar and aggravates my gastritis.
10qxpbt,"Are you aware of adrenal fatigue? Is that a possibility for you? I don‚Äôt feel qualified to offer education on the topic, but I will share this: if is something I‚Äôve been diagnosed with and was told IF probably contributed to it (only for certain people like myself; my doc has plenty of patients who do IF with great success, it‚Äôs just not one size fits all). I‚Äôve been advised that I‚Äôm in the category of people who should not do it. Now, that being said, what they have me doing instead still ends up being at least a 12 hour fast. But what‚Äôs important for me is eating as soon as I get up in the morning. And making sure dinner is done by 7:00. I have found, over time, I do well being done for the night at more like 6:00 (says the ex-chronic bedtime ‚Äúsnacked‚Äù where snacks became whole meals). Depending on what time I wake up, that‚Äôs still a decent beginner-level IF fast. And my docs are fine with that - they just want me eating within 30 minutes of waking. I have NO idea if any of this will help you, but it‚Äôs something to look into. And maybe something to experiment with. It was a functional medicine clinic that helped me (NPs, not physicians), and it‚Äôs been actually rather life-changing for me. I would never have guessed that shifting everything earlier to align better with circadian rhythms would make such a difference, but for me it has. I hope you find the right pattern for yourself soon and feel better."
10qxpbt,"I do IF pretty naturally as I‚Äôve never actually wanted breakfast or been hungry first thing in the morning, really for my whole life. My natural eating window is pretty close to 12-8pm so I try to keep inside that window. 

However I will absolutely get what you‚Äôre describing too if I break my fast with too large &/or carb heavy a meal. I usually start lunch by having something small and high protein or high fat, like two cheese sticks, or some almonds and a hard boiled egg, or one of those premade guacamole packs and a cheese stick. Somewhere between 100-300 calories of fat and protein and very little carbs if any. 

Then after that, maybe 20-60 minutes later, I‚Äôll have a full lunch. I find this helps with the blood sugar issue as well as GI issues - I also sometimes get diarrhea/bloating if I eat too much too quickly as my first meal. (Sorry if TMI)."
10qxpbt,"There is no evidence fasting helps with weight loss at all.   A new study proved this.   You're just better eating smaller meals and counting your calories via an app like Lose It.  


https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/intermittent-fasting-isnt-linked-weight-loss-study-rcna66122"
10qxpbt,"This doesn't sound like low blood sugar, but high. Low blood sugar would make you shaky, palpatations. 

Another couple ideas: making serotonin if your diet contains a good mix of carbs and proteins, especially those with lots of l-tryptophan  
Parasympathetic ""rest and digest"" coming on stronger now for all the reasons that everything seems to be extreme with menopause.  
Blood going to your stomach to digest and not your brain. Which is sorta 2 but also a little different.

I am experiencing this now too, and am a bit worried about diabetes."
10qxpbt,What are you eating when you break your fast?
10qxpbt,Sounds similar to what I experience. I can't go long between meals or I get shaky and nauseated.
10qxpbt,That is a good point. Long COVID put in early menopause. My hormones have been a mess ever since.
10qxpbt,Yes. I would love that smoothie recipe. Thank you!!
10qxpbt,Well that would def be me.. I don't sleep well at all.
10qxpbt,How did they test you for that? Diabetes runs in my family so I have always been worried about it.
10qxpbt,Get your iron checked !
10qxpbt,I do think I might have AF.  My levels are all low. Have you found your new eating plan has helped? Have you lost any weight? Can you share a days meal plan example?
10qxpbt,Thanks. This is a good idea.
10qxpbt,I had steamed rice with 2 soft boiled eggs and a diced avocado. So I had a protein and carb. I thought that would be okay.
10qxpbt,"Not everyone can fast. Id not try it again without getting to a doctor. There is more than one path to weight loss, after all, that aren't gonna risk health."
10qxpbt,Same I posted above that when my new doctor looked at my fasting glucose she said this totally made sense as it was low.   Fasting was unlikely to be tolerable to me.
10qxpbt,"Green Smoothie  
Makes enough for 2 large glasses (one daily serve per person)  
\- 1x Banana  
\- 1 Large handful of Spinach/Silverbeet  
\- 1 Handful of Kale (pull the leaves off of the stalk. The stalk tastes horrible)  
\- 2-3 Stalks of Celery  
\- 1x Green Apple / Pear / Similar fruit of your choice  
\- 1x Piece of peeled ginger (the size of a thumb)  
\- 1/2 an avocado  
\- Hemp/Oat milk filled up to the max line on nutribullet (2 large glasses worth). Could use water if you're brave. Basically any liquid.  
\- Broccoli sprouts 2-3 tablespoons. Not essential but highly recommended. If you can't get them from the supermarket they are easy to grow at home with a basic kit. Takes 3 days or so to sprout.  
Optional - Brazil nuts, blanched almonds, collagen powder, spirulina powder, matcha powder, maca powder. I mix/match these depending on our taste and what we have in the pantry. If you think it needs sweetening then good quality honey is a good choice.  
Fruit Smoothie  
I have one glass of this per day if I still feel hungry after dinner or fancy something sweet.  
1x Banana  
1 cup of blueberries  
1 cup of other berries / fruit (Mango, Pineapple, Raspberries etc)  
1-2 Tablespoons of honey (to taste)  
Small piece of peeled ginger  
1/2 avocado  
RAW milk.  After you try it you'll never go back to supermarket milk. It is Amazing!  
Optional- As above, I normally mix in some nuts, almonds and stuff like that.  
Other Notes  
I like to rinse my leafy greens in a big bowl with a couple of drops of veggie wash first. It gets all of the soil/bugs off first. One rinse with veggie wash and then one with clean water.  
Organic or straight out of your own garden is best but maintaining the habit is the key."
10qxpbt,"Glucose tolerance test. You drink a big bottle of nasty sugar syrup, then they check your blood sugar a few times over 2 hours. It tells them if your body is metabolizing the sugar normally. I had really low blood sugar by the end of the second hour. It felt terrible."

I can‚Äôt even get my ass down for bloodwork it‚Äôs like days are a strange blur of missed appointments, bad decisions and financial fuck ups ! Reading this got me in a better frame of mind to resolve to get to the lab !"
10yvpmd,"Yay, congrats!!"
10yvpmd,How long will you take HRT
10yvpmd,"Don't bother with getting bloods done, they don't help unless your officially menopausal. I'm peri and there no blood works to show that. The GP was useless but a menopausal specialist is the way to go."
10yvpmd,Until the doctor says to stop.
10yvpmd,So no concerns about breast cancer risk increasing if more than a year?
10yvpmd,Is that a thing?
10yvpmd,"I feel like I‚Äôm trolling the menopause Reddit now. Should probably start my own thread. But my oncologist on Monday was adamant that that‚Äôs what the data shows - more than a year on HRT increases breast cancer risk. I‚Äôm wondering what the counter to that is. (I had breast cancer & will be taking hormone blockers & I was like, the media is currently obsessed with adding hormones and all the benefits & I have to do the opposite?"
10yvpmd,No I'm not concerned. There is a 4 in 1000 chance of getting breast cancer on HRT. But if I'm going to worry about getting cancer these days I wouldn't eat or drink anything as according to so many reports everything gives you cancer. My mum was fit and healthy and still got cancer (not breast cancer) and died after 4 months so am I meant to sit at home in bubble to make I don't get pancreatic cancer like mum?
10yvpmd,"I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean it like, aren‚Äôt you worried? I‚Äôm wondering what doctors who prescribe it say. I understand taking it & this is all me looking at a doctor who wants to remove my ovaries & also drug down any sneaky attempts by my body to make more estrogen. I‚Äôm obsessed with hormones. Sorry for doing this on your post."
10yvpmd,If you're worried only a medical professional can give you answers. Maybe seek a second opinion. No point in accidentally scaring other women who are also trying to get their hormones under control and who have followed their doctor's advice.
10yvpmd,"Ah yes, medical professionals vs the wisdom of women."
10yvpmd,Well maybe I'm lucky that female doctor (medical professional with the wisdom of a woman) I went to see was brilliant. Not many specialised menopause clinics in Ireland but the few we have got are brilliant.
10r9jlu,"The GROIN sweat! Omg, I hate it. I recently was on the hunt for a new car and happened to find one with a FAN IN THE SEAT! I had no idea that existed. It‚Äôs my best friend now. Cool, dry air on my butt for every drive now. üå¨Ô∏è Ha ha."
10r9jlu,"Yay!  I will congratulate you.  The countdown began/has begun.  
Lol, I say boobage and am trying to get it to ‚Äúcatch on.‚Äù  
Chronic case of swamp crotch and monkey butt since I moved to the equator that no amount of powder or Lume or whatever will stop.
My middle is heavier, too.  Wth.
Had my IUD removed 7 months ago, and went right back to periods.  I hope the shark week ends one day for me.  I hope you never have another shark week, and alligator month hahaha.  That‚Äôs awesome.  I love that I literally am giving less and less of a flying eff about anything."
10r9jlu,"I am with you! I had a full hysterectomy in Oct, and boy did it rock my world. I went to sleep at 3am this morning. Why? Because my eyes literally wouldn't shut. 

I go through more clothing changes than a Broadway show bc I freeze until my insides decide that we are Mt. Vesuvius and we're angry. The sweating... I don't have swamp ass, I have swamp body. 

I have asked my husband to start looking into retirement homes because I'm pretty sure my brain melted in a hot flash. And the mood swings, it's a wonder I still *have* a husband.

I am on estradiol .5 2x a day. It isn't enough."
10r9jlu,"I congratulate you and join you, though I am a little further down the road. The swamp does dry up to an extent ~ good news~ at least in winter where I am. I hope that since you started hrt in a timely fashion for you that the crepey skin holds off. 

I am sure it started for me when my last cell of estrogen left and took the elastic out of my face and chin. So more reasons to celebrate!!

There is a certain sigh of relief about not giving a crap about so much stuff anymore.

To the lady that moved to the equator,  my sincere sympathy. I hope to God that it is worth the world to you to have to move there at this point in life. üß°"
10r9jlu,"Congradulations üåå & sry for the painful IUD removal. Celebrate tonight & Yessss üëèüëèüëèüëè to unwanted male attention been praying for this part since I was 12

Booo to men just about knocking older women over because they don't see us as worthy of respect

10r9jlu,"Let's see, definitely pregnancy-free sex has been a nice bonus for the past decade. Fewer fucks to give- check! IUD gone, minimal swamp but definitely hot flashes, fat middle is NOT my damn fault (still trying to accept this but it's rough), crepe-y arms near elbows and wrinkly hands, less unwanted leering big plus.....

OH a little something to celebrate today: Moved a bunch of money to another bank for a good CD rate. That made me feel like a big shot. The woman at the bank was trying to gauge my investment needs and asked, ""do you have children?"" I chuckled and said ""no, that's why I have *money!*"" :-p 

The last time I got a CD was likely before the helpful teller was born, and I had 1/10th the amount for one back then. Still not enough to retire with, but it was fun to reflect on that."
10r9jlu,You are hilarious. I loved reading this.
10r9jlu,"Omg
 I would pay extra for this feature! You have won gold! Blow that air on my groin $$$"
10r9jlu,Wow! I'm gonna look for that!!!
10r9jlu,my car has that! we call it the coochie cooler!
10r9jlu,"I completely,  sincerely hope the alligators come calling your name! It's a different set of troubles but I wish it for you."
10r9jlu,"I'm constantly testing my memory because I'm convinced it's slipping away. Also thinking about housing geared toward old folks!! 

Don't think I have mood swings, but I do have to contain my true, dark self. For example, a co-worker was decorating our cubicles for the holidays, and I snapped, ""can you get stuff with *less glitter?!*"" I didn't realize how that came out until she gave me a *look.* I quickly tempered that comment with something lighter."
10r9jlu,Hi . After hysterectomy? 5 is not enough . I also had hysterectomy. The 75 did not work for me so second week now / today on 100mg . I feel normal. Ask your gyno / go to up it for you . We needed it so badly for hysterectomy mamas:)
10r9jlu,I love that!! üòÇ
10r9jlu,Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
10r9jlu,"Are we the same person? When you said you have to contain your true, dark self, I felt that in my bones. I do have an affinity for glitter, though."
10r9jlu,"Glitter is fine at a distance! I'm also a little uptight about wasteful plastics and such, and I'm constantly losing small battles over preventing wastefulness at work. So I have to squelch that part of me, shut my mouth and go along with stuff like holiday decorations and the resulting glitter mess. Fine, I'll contribute a few bucks to *wasteful nonsense fro the dollar store, with bonus added glitter* just to avoid being labeled a ""grinch."" Bah fucking humbug.

Was telling a co-worker the other day how our industry is designed for failure and things will never run efficiently. They didn't know how to respond, so I had to reel it in again....... :-/"
10r9jlu,"Sounds to me like you just call it like it is. An admirable quality to me.

I used to hate anything termed ""feminine,"" glitter, pink, all but the bare minimum make-up. But I've realized that as I lose fucks, I am letting myself enjoy things that I railed against in my earlier years. Lol

Idk what industry you work in, but it feels like they're all like that anymore. Hugs offered."
10r9jlu,"Ha, thanks! I'm actually very reserved in general. I go along with whatever other people want, trying to keep things moving most of the time. I know we've all got opinions so I don't really express my own, so I quietly try to fight the good fight- rarely works though.

Occasionally I trust somebody enough to express myself, or figure it's an acceptable situation, but it seems to take people by surprise I guess!"
10tu4y0,We got in a huge argument over my lack of libido one night so I handed him my little book of current symptoms and what they belong too.    After that he began to slowly understand and work with me.  I did worry him when I woke up and cried last night for no reason.  He does his best to give me space to work out things if I need too.
10tu4y0,"Will your husband appreciate humor as it relates to menopause and the changes we are all going through? In the US, Lee Ann Morgan is a great stand up, southern comedian who puts a great deal of humor into the menopausal topic. She is all over YouTube. I watch all of her videos and share snippets with my husband. This allows us both to learn and laugh in a humorous, relatable way without me shoving boring data down his throat. You can find her on Google or YouTube. She also has a podcast  called ""Sweaty and Pissed"" which will teach you a lot."
10tu4y0,"https://www.menopausematters.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,2458.0.html

This is a good forum - UK-based.  I linked to the forum about husbands. I haven‚Äôt read it in a while, but there has been good info."

10tu4y0,I was thinking earlier today about asking this exact question on here!
10tu4y0,"What has helped you? Have him listen to or read it. There's this podcast called We Can Do Hard Things. Last year Glynnon had Dr. Jen Gunter on as a guest to real about menopause. Two-part episode that was excellent. I ordered her book from the library. I won't get my husband to read that book, but he will listen to podcasts."
10tu4y0,"Dr. Barbara Taylor has a chapter in her book 
Menopause Your Management Your Way 
That is written specifically for men."
10tu4y0,Get him to get on here.
10tu4y0,I gave him the link to this Reddit
10tu4y0,I actually sent mine here.
10tu4y0,Like a symptoms journal? I think I need to start doing that myself!
10tu4y0,I think he might connect with this! Great suggestion! Thank you!

10tu4y0,I would never have my husband listen to that episode. It was awful.

10jorc4,"Bralettes may be the ticket.  I used to think they were for smaller busts, but that's not the case.  I can get away with one with 90% of work tops.  

For the rashy/itchiness I recommend bra liners.  You can buy them ready made, but I make my own out of old white t-shirts from my boys.  Most go in the rag bucket, but I save a couple for me!  I hate the feeling of wetness and on days when it's bad I get out my cleansing wipes and a new bra band and it helps to freshen up."
10jorc4,"Big boobs since elementary school here. A few years ago, I FINALLY found a great sports bra to hold everything in (those suckers aren‚Äôt moving at all!). Highly recommend the front zip Under Armour sports bra. It‚Äôs great support, but more importantly, I will never go back to the torture of trying to shimmy a sweaty sports bra off of my sweaty body. Front zip forever. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10jorc4,Sports bra are my friend right now.  My normal bras get uncomfortable after a while so I started wearing sports bras.  I can stand them longer.
10jorc4,/r/ABraThatFits
10jorc4,Is everyone else constantly bombarded by online ads for every allegedly ‚Äúmost comfortable bra ever made!‚Äù?
10jorc4,Sports bras for exercise. Bralettes for everyday. I like the True & Co V neck bras from Target.
10jorc4,"I'm going to plug Aerie bras. I know it's a teen brand, but they have a great range of sizes, styles, and colors. I don't know who is responsible for R&D there, but their bras just keep getting better and better. They have a lot of bralettes, sports bras, and adaptive bras too. They also offer nude bras and undies for a range of skin tones. They have frequent sales."
10jorc4, Breast reduction should be part of menopause treatment
10jorc4,Besides sports bras look at Cosabella bras.
10jorc4,"Try the Bravado range. They started off making maternity bras, but they were so comfortable that they added non-maternity bras as well. Thr Sculpt is the one I use. Nothing is rigid, it's all stretchy. I don't know if it'll hold you firmly enough for exercise, but at least the band won't hurt. 

I've got fibro and I can't wear ordinary bras at all now. I once spent ages in Bravissimo with a dedicated shop assistant trying every bras she could think of, and they were all met with howls of, ""GET IT OFF ME!"" Polite howls, of course."
10jorc4,Sport bras are my friends these days!
10jorc4,"My issue is I am an in-between size now that mine have grown in menopause. I was a nice 36D.. now 36DD is too small, so is 38 D.  I have to buy 38DD, but band width around is too big! And the cup is little too big, but Finding 36 DDD is dam near impossible even tho 36 feels wrong too and of course nobody makes a 37.. I hate bras now!  Boobs are useless at my age ü§£"
10jorc4,"These are my favorite bras right now: Warner's Women's Blissful Benefits Dig-Free Band with Seamless Stretch Wireless Lightly Lined Comfort Bra Rm0911w. They are just under $16 on Amazon. I wear about a 40DD and use a 2X. The straps are very thin but the band does the heavy lifting. Unlike my other comfort bras, the pads are sewn in, which I prefer. The straps will also allow me to wear a spaghetti strap tank without looking bad. Worth a shot for the price."
10jorc4,"knix knix knix.  Cute, comfortable, and an amazing wash and wear return policy.  I wear the luxelift, no uniboob, etc.  The catalyst is very supportive, but the luxelift is my daily bra.  Try it, because if you hate them, you return them for a different size or money back, so no risk."
10jorc4,‚ÄúUnderoutfit‚Äù are the best I‚Äôve ever had.
10jorc4,Mission impossible a lot of the time - but have consulted with heavier breasted women and they recommend 2 bras (can be less tight and more comfortable than one tight bra) I use one soft cup and one underwire combined. Also had corsette/corsolette recommended (like a long line bra) so the midriff section does a lot of the work rather than one tight chest band. Haven't tried this yet.
10jorc4,"I got implants a few years ago so this is all new to me- never had boob sweat before in my life! I do have regrets and will get them removed in a few years. For now I wear mostly sports bras- and I don‚Äôt run because I hate running and it‚Äôs hard on the joints. I walk uphill or do elliptical, stairs or bike"
10jorc4,Same boat - you can search my older thread - there were good recs there. I JUST found a fantastic bra at Athleta and they fucking discontinued it! But try longline or lounge bras for day and get yourself a tailor‚Äôs measuring tape! I discovered my band size is much smaller than I thought and my cup size was bigger. It sucks - bras feel horrible by 4pm. Its not you its them!
10jorc4,"I highly recommend Evelyn Bobbie - their Evelyn bra is the best.

10jorc4,"Second this, followed by a look-see at www.brashopdirectory.com, if you're in the States, to check for small business bra stores near you."
10jorc4,I tried this and spent a lot of money on the recommended bras and none of them were a comfortable fit
10jorc4,Came here to post this.
10jorc4,Yup and funny how none of them come in my size.
10jorc4,second this - they use breathable materials and have good stretch. I also LOVe their bikini swim tops
10jorc4,"Agreed. 

There was an academic paper or opinion piece in an academic paper that I read once which roughly said ""When you look at outcomes for women who have breast reductions, almost all measures show improved quality of life. But that can't be right or all women would need a breast reduction!""

My paraphrasing is only a vague memory, I read it 15 years ago when I was trying to fight insurance to get a breast reduction. They are still here, just heavier and more uncomfortable."
10jorc4,And insurance coverage!!
10jorc4,"Forgive me if you know this, but look for 36F size, which is the same as 36DDD."
10jorc4,"How many did you try? Its really a lot of trial and error. I hate it. But I've got a few bras that are the best fit I've ever had. Great fit? No, but better than any professional fitting or on my own adventuring. It takes time and a lot of feedback though."
10jorc4,That calculator was a big fail for me too.
10jorc4,It's a lot of trial and error. But it eliminated my back pain by 95%.
10jorc4,Right? It's all pretty great. I forgot to mention they now have an anti-shape wear collection with mesh bralettes and undies. MESH! I mean what could be more comfy and cooling for our overheated selves?
10jorc4,I have. That's also a hard size to find. Haven't found a single one in a store I can try on.
10jorc4,You can try Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúWardrobe‚Äù so you can try on larger sized bras without paying for them upfront. I had like $500 worth of bras delivered once and not a single one fit. I was glad I didn‚Äôt have to outlay the money to find that out!
10jorc4,Wow. Had no idea this existed. Thanks I will try that
10vbjfu,"I‚Äôm sorry for the difficult time you‚Äôre going through. I‚Äôm relating way too much to everything in your post. My situation with my mom is similar to yours, and some days‚Ä¶on top of dealing with health issues, helping my adult kids with their dilemmas, and working full time, in addition to other daily life stresses‚Ä¶ it leaves me feeling maxed out on stress and wondering why does life throw so much at us at once? Then when I finally do lay down, I‚Äôm so anxious that I‚Äôm just mindlessly doomscrolling on my phone:/

I feel that most people seriously underestimate the magnitude and power that hormones have in our bodies. Very few doctors will acknowledge that these hormone changes can massively impact our mental and physical health.

I‚Äôve been in a similar place where you are many times over the past few years, of feeling like I don‚Äôt think I can go on or take much more. I guess I‚Äôm telling you this so you know that you‚Äôre not alone, and so many of us in this group are in very similar situationsüíô We‚Äôre here for you!

I‚Äôm sure many others here will second this, but if it‚Äôs a viable option for you, I would definitely recommend starting a conversation with your doctor about HRT, if you haven‚Äôt already.

Edit: grammar/spelling"
10vbjfu,"Wow we have very similar issues. I'm so sorry you are dealing with all of this. I will say that I am feeling as if there is some light at the end of the tunnel now that I am on HRT and getting real sleep. I don't think I had slept for the past couple years. Mom with dementia, 2 teens with mental health issues who are always struggling, crazy work stress/exhaustion and always failing at everything. I genuinely didn't want to live anymore. But, while none of that external stuff has changed, I did manage to get the strength to just start on a self-care journey and am starting to feel a little stronger. HRT plus therapy plus regular exercise and making time to relax in bed at night rather than watch netflix for hours. All of it has helped a little. The first step was that I started making time for 'fun' now and then. A thing I had totally given up. I really really focused on just that. Making just a little time for me. It's a cliche but you really can't help others until you help yourself first."
10vbjfu,Thank you all.  I‚Äôm real ashamed of myself for even taking the day off.  I didn‚Äôt do anything except lay in bed. It was not a productive day at all and I know I‚Äôm going to have to get my brain in gear for tomorrow. I appreciate your support.‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
10vbjfu,First off Breathe and remember you are not alone.  We all here have our struggles but we are here to listen.  Sending you a virtual hug and shoulder to cry or vent on.
10vbjfu,I feel ya!
10vbjfu,"Have you thought about an in home, part time helper for your Mom?  I worked for a while for a company that did just that.  We would  help with personal care (like showers, etc), take them on errands or appointments, play cards and games, go on walks and just be there so they had someone to talk to.  I did everything from addressing Christmas cards to weeding flower beds.  I bet there is a company in your area.

I want to say that it is NEVER to late to live the life you want.  You will have to make sacrifices and it will be hard, but you can do it.  Three years ago I quit a job I hated and started up a small craft business, left a high demand religion (mormon), lost weight, cut my hair, and got multiple piercings in my ears.  I am so happy to finally be me!   It was hard for the people around me at first (family, friends) and I lost a few along the way, but I kept the important ones, (husband, children, real friends) and would do it all over again, only MUCH earlier in my life.  You can make changes, really you can do it.  Write down all the things you really, really, want and need, then pick one and go for it.  

Sending you good vibes and Good Luck!"
10vbjfu,"I think you should feel proud of yourself for today. It might not have been outwardly productive, but I bet your body and mind are thanking you for it.

I need to kick ot up a gear at work tomorrow too. I'll think of you when I am pushing myself to be just a little bit more productive during the day. I'll still probably still  just doomscroll in the evening again though."
10vbjfu,"Don't feel ashamed. You needed a break and it's good that you took it!  

As someone who also struggles with ongoing, lifelong mental health issues, I just want to say that I understand how hard it is on top of all of the menopausal hormonal changes. I'm on an antidepressant and in therapy and honestly I don't know how helpful they've been over the past 6 months or so. I started microdosing psilocybin a few weeks ago (I was having suicidal ideation and felt really scared and desperate) and so far it's been a good experience. The biggest change for me is that I'm not having suicidal thoughts which is huge. I'm not sure if this is something that you'd consider or have access to, but thought I would share. I also started testosterone cream a few days ago (my testosterone level was very low and I've been struggling with brain fog and hair loss-my gyn thinks it should help with both) but who knows whether or not it will help. 

Anyway, I'm thinking of you-you are not alone!"
10vbjfu,You should be proud of yourself for recognising your needs and taking action to meet them.  This ‚Äòguilt of being lazy‚Äô is a boomer construct designed to brainwash us into always putting them and their needs first.  We were raised from a young age to believe this rubbish and we‚Äôve never questioned it.  Boomers had us because they wanted us to do things for them.  You are going through significant biological changes and your health both physical and mental needs to take priority.  Your mother has serious mental health issues and needs to be in a home or have a full time carer.
10vbjfu,"I had a Carazeee work ethic. Then at age 53, I used up all of my leave and quit -nope, did not retire- from my job of 19 years. My mom has just last week told me her debit card had been hacked and charged, and her credit score had plunged. I too feel like I haven‚Äôt begun living for myself, and I selfishly want to escape this destiny."
10vbjfu,"Me too, sister.  I also spend waaay too much time playing Royal Match & Candy Crush & other stupid phone games."
10vbjfu,"Interesting.  I have a good friend who swears by microdosing and another friend involved in researching psilocybin who says that the effects don‚Äôt last & may cause heart problems later.  They just don‚Äôt know the long term effects yet bc they only recently sanctioned studies.  Idk whether to try it or not.  I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having a good experience though & this is definitely not the first time I‚Äôve heard this.  I‚Äôll think about it again.  

And the testosterone cream - Rx?  How‚Äôd you get it?  What‚Äôd you get it prescribed for?  I want to ask my gyn about that too."
10vbjfu,And I‚Äôll be thinking of you tomorrow too!üíï
10vbjfu,Duh.  You said brain fog & hair loss.  Obviously i too have brain fog.  Sorry.  üòû
10vbjfu,No worries! I get it!! My gyn prescribed the testosterone. I had (and have) a lot of anxiety about taking it but I figure if I start having distressing side effects I can always stop.
10gj23y,Does it have biotin in it? Because biotin gave me rally painful cystic acne.

10vc8y5,"I think my voice has improved in the last few years, but that‚Äôs because I started taking omeprazole for acid reflux. Taking that medicine resolved or improved quite a few issues in my throat - less reflux, less coughing, less snoring, less sore throat, less asthma, smoother voice, better tonal range, etc. 

The ENT should have discussed GERD with you, but if they didn‚Äôt, your nodules may be irritated with reflux, that might explain the coming and going too. I don‚Äôt know that GERD is related to hormones, but it certainly is a factor for a lot of women at this stage. Just a thought. 

The PPI doesn‚Äôt have to be for life, it‚Äôs like an anti-inflammatory in that you can take it so the affected tissues can heal. I‚Äôve been taking it for a year or two, and lately I‚Äôve stopped, to see if symptoms come back. So far so good."
10vc8y5,"It is absolutely a thing. According to a podcast I recently listened to, it‚Äôs well known in the opera world that hormones affects the voice. In the 18th and 19th century, female opera singers were not scheduled to perform during their periods, it was feared that singing at that time would harm the voice. In musical education, it‚Äôs becoming more widely understood that women‚Äôs voices also break in puberty, although it‚Äôs less noticeable than in boys. Ask any professional female singer who‚Äôs gone through menopause and she‚Äôll likely tell you her voice did change."
10vc8y5,I have a ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù horse voice from my thyroid condition.  It‚Äôs one of the newer symptoms that have popped up and I first thought it was due to teaching and talking over students/instruments but it‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs actually from my goiter rubbing against my vocal chords when it swells.
10vc8y5,An ENT who doesn't believe hormones can affect the voice doesn't sound like someone who should have a medical license. Sheesh.
10vc8y5,Go to a voice clinic for help. I go to one. They are experts.
10vc8y5,"Horse shit, vocal changes are a thing, and take place in unison with menstrual cycles and other journeyman chances. Will update when I find the article I read about that over the weekend"
10vc8y5,"Thank you everyone for the suggestions, and for letting me know this is in fact a thing. :) I'll get to the dr for some tests and hopefully have a more concrete idea of what is going on in a bit."
10vc8y5,Vocal  cord nodules are not linked to hormones.  Not EVERYTHING is menopause!
10vc8y5,"the ENT did mention the reflux angle and while I've never experienced heartburn except for when I was pregnant I have been doing the no eating after 6 thing. I haven't experienced much of a change that I can tell from that, but I will ask the doc about the possibility that I'm not feeling it but it's still irritating my throat.   Its good to know that I can stop eventually. I hope it keeps working for you."
10vc8y5,"That's what I was gonna say- it doesn't take a Dr to know that voices change during puberty, so there's got to be some type of correlation with hormones!"
10vc8y5,"I had never even considered a thyroid condition, thank you for commenting. Do thyroid problems coincide with menopause, or are they an entirely separate issue?  Were you able to improve your symptoms at all?  I couldn't imagine having to talk all day with this going on, sorry you're going through that."
10vc8y5,Thyroid was the first thing I thought of! OP should have some blood drawn and see if everything is ok in thyroid-land.
10vc8y5,Amen to that
10vc8y5,I have been on the waiting list for the only one in my area for the last few months.  I have tried to find some videos of vocal exercises that could help but have not come up with anything yet.  Do they mainly help you retrain your voice to create less friction on the vocal cords?
10vc8y5,"Thanks, I'd love to read more about this."
10vc8y5,"Certainly we can't always *assume* that any new symptom is peri/menopause.  Anything new should always be investigated to determine other causes, but sharing symptoms here gives others information of things to look for and research. For instance....

>the relative excess of androgens after menopause may lead to a slight drop in the pitch of the voice. Other voice changes observed after menopause include huskiness, vocal fatigue, and inability to reach high harmonics. These changes are appreciated more in professional singers and teachers who use the voice for living. Hormone replacement therapy has shown to reverse most of the observed voice changes in postmenopausal females.

10vc8y5,"Thanks, hope it all works out for you too. 

Reflux can get weird, my worst symptom was never heartburn, in fact I also rarely felt that. The worst was that I could not get over colds/coughs, to the point where every day I was vomiting from hard coughing. That got much better after a few weeks of the med and eventually stopped. My weirdest symptom is that I would get these silly hiccupy burps every afternoon (when I‚Äôm hungry)."
10vc8y5,Separate issues but share 75% of same symptoms.   Medication helps and I always have water near by.
10vc8y5,I have read that estrogen attacks the thyroid so I guess hormonal imbalances especially unopposed estrogen could cause/trigger or even mimic a thyroid disease.
10vc8y5,What they would do will depend on your diagnosis. I‚Äôm sorry there is such a wait where you are.
10vc8y5,What sort of Dr / tests did you have to go to for a diagnosis?
10vc8y5,PCP or Endocrinologist can run a thyroid panel via blood work.

10vgaah,"I agree with you, and then I'm also going to go a little farther and say that what really sucks about this is that it's not all that well-studied. I was trying to get a hard number on the increased risk of oral BCP for stroke, blood clots and gallbladder disease - and the studies are SO thin on this that even the menopause association's [2022 position statement](https://www.menopause.org/docs/default-source/professional/nams-2022-hormone-therapy-position-statement.pdf) states: 

>Observational studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of [blood clot] with transdermal [estrogen therapy], and limited observational data suggest less risk with transdermal versus oral [estrogen therapy], but comparative [randomized controlled trial] data again are lacking.

[I subbed in actual words for each abbreviation they used]


The only thing I can really see in their analysis is that the oral BCP has the 1-2 punch of being orally administered and also creates a higher systemic estrogen level than transdermal HRT. But with so few studies, they are using really large global statistics that incorporate women of mixed ages in various stages of peri and meno, women taking oral and various transdermal preparations, women with and without a uterus, etc. There are so many variables that they can't even zero in on which factors influence the negative outcomes. Is it the form of estrogen or progesterone? Is it specific to each woman's biochemistry and how she responds to the various forms of synthetic or bioidentical hormones? 

One practical thought - you can buy BCP online from overseas pharmacies, but why not try talking to your doc first about injectable estrogen, and then oral micronized progesterone? If what your body was responding positively to was the solid, unchanging dose of estrogen daily and the issues with transdermal were inefficient uptake and different absorption rates depending on where the patch/cream/gel was, maybe an injectable estrogen would give you the stability of a known, controlled dose but without the red flag of oral administration?"
10vgaah,"No, generally birth control is not recommended beyond the age of 55.  However, most doctors will recommend switching from low dose birth control to MHT/HRT to help the transition through menopause.  So your doctor was negligent in this.  

Do you still have periods?  If so, you cannot be menopausal (aka post-meno). Also compounded hormones **are not** the safest form of ""bio-identical"" hormones, they are actually not FDA-approved or proven to be safe at all.  

Prescribed FDA-approved MHT/HRT in the form of an estradiol patch and micronized progesterone is actually very safe and effective. Oral tablets carry increased risks and transdermal options are better tolerated and effective.   

Because MHT is ""low"" dosage compared to birth control, you may not have any issues.  You might want to take a second look at MHT."
10vgaah,"You can buy bc pills online without a prescription if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre really trying to do. 
DM me if you want to know of some places where you can,"
10vgaah,"Hi fir some reason my message DM to you is being blocked. 
Happy family medstore . Com ( one sentence - putting it this way so this isn‚Äôt blocked!)
All day chemist . Com
I have a friend without Imsurace or access to Planned parenthood who uses these."
10vgaah,"It does have more to do with the type of hormones used and dosages of those hormones.  Birth control has higher hormonal dosages over MHT and that alone increases risk.  

Also birth control uses ethinyl estradiol as estrogen, while MHT does not contain any ethinyl estradiol. Also birth control is a steady dose of hormones that suppress ovarian function, while MHT does not. Certainly any oral estrogen (whether it be birth control or MHT) carries higher risks for stroke, blood clots and high blood pressure."
10vgaah,"There is nothing wrong with oral estradiol -- pills work better than patches for many women, and the risks are only slightly higher. My doc much prefers pills."
10vgaah,"Thank you for your response. 

I suppose this is my point. I really do not understand exactly what you pointed out ""No, generally birth control is not recommended beyond the age of 55."" - Why??? Where is the research to back this up? This article, which was extremely informative, [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html), explains the issues surrounding the studies done regarding HRT back in its ""hey day"" that created a bit of hysteria of the supposed dangers, resulting in a significant push back and Dr.'s adopting a very negative attitude of HRT and scripts dropped significantly to almost non-existent. 

This article also discusses how every woman is different. And that those, like myself, that have no significant health issues or histories so to speak, do not have other options, we are only offered the options geared toward those with risks. I am aware that any medication comes with risks, but that is what I was trying to say, is I SHOULD have the option to take the BC pills as that is MY CHOICE! If I am informed and I have discussed with my doctor the risks, etc, why should it NOT be my choice! Smoking has more risks, but anyone can choose to smoke! ( I am not a smoker BTW - LOL). The pills I was on were ultra low dose combo pill, and not the progesterone only pills. And I believe it was he consistent dosage of the BC pills is what made them work well FOR ME. The constant dosage/combo guessing game/process of elimination with the BHRT  was not only mind numbingly frustrating, but I think it is what caused so many issues. I could NEVER get to a ""working"" combo/dose. Nothing made me feel the way I did while on the pill. I just feel that there should be as many variations for a consistent delivery of hormones for menopausal women as pre menopausal women, as some of us benefit from that type of delivery. 

And re: compounded, i have to disagree with you there, for me, they are the safest, b/c I am extremely sensitive to most commercial drugs. I am not a fan of the FDA - an agency that continued to say that Glyphosate ( RoundUP) posed no health risks to the public???? - so the fact that compounding pharms are not FDA approved, has never been an issue for concern as far as I'm concerned. And, it also allowed my doctor to customize the meds. Additionally, the one my Dr. works with is PCAB Accredited. 

In any event, thank you for your response and input, I may have to take another look at MHT. Do you happen to know if there is a source that gives you a breakdown of what is in these ""meds""? I 'd like to compare them to the make up of the BC pills I was on to see how comparable they are as it relates to dosages of the individual hormones, as well as look at other potential fillers that may be in the progesterone pills specifically.

And yes, I am in meno, no period for 2 yrs. So, to be honest, I don;t know is that considered ""post"" meno? That's another mystery, and I guess a topic for another post!! Hahaha!"
10vgaah,Can you check your messages üôèüèº
10vgaah,I looked up the reviews on their website most people say its a scam do you know anything about this company? Have you ordered from them before? (Asking for my aunt)
10vgaah,"Yeah, we know the difference between the methods, but I was looking specifically for a study that used ethinyl estradiol post-menopause. If they've tested it to see if that form carries some specific risk for menopausal women, I haven't found the study. Most of the things we repeat here to people asking advice are things found in studies. But the pill hormones themselves don't seem to have a menopause study associated with them outside of these global data comparative studies - in which they are considered acceptable, and appear as viable options as treatment. If there was a woman whose body responded better to ethinyl estradiol than any other form of estrogen, why would it be off the table while other oral formulations of estrogen are still prescribed? If you have a link to a study that explains why that form of estrogen carries risk after a certain age, please link it!"
10vgaah,"> No, generally birth control is not recommended beyond the age of 55."" - Why???

The same reason most medical decisions are made. CYA (cover your...arse) and fear of malpractice claims. Most Doctors will not prescribe outside the normal dosage. (ie - take any kind of chance of getting sued because of deviating from the normal standard)

That being said, birth control pills are 'first pass' medications. They metabolize through the liver and the chance of blood clots does increase at 55+ from oral estrogen. Most MHT after 55 is patches.

We women get..oh say..1.0 or 1.5 tops of estrogen. Transgender M-t-F get more than that regardless of age. But of course they don't have ovaries/uterus/cervix to get cancer. I was about to type 'the risk goes up with the higher dose"" but no...we don't know that because as far as I know there have never been studies. Also, what is an acceptable risk to feel better? 2.6% get x cancer at 1.0 dose, and 2.8 get it at 2.0? I'd roll the dice. But if the chance moved from 2.6 to 9.8, maybe not so much. All risk and reward.

TL:DR - Why? It's all about Doctors mitigating their chances of lawsuits."
10vgaah,">""No, generally birth control is not recommended beyond the age of 55."" - Why??? 

Because risks increase for stroke/blood clots.

I'm very familiar with the NY times article, but the hormones in birth control and MHT/HRT are two different things.  

I would suggest you read our Menopause Wiki for more information."

10vgaah,">If you have a link to a study that explains why that form of estrogen carries risk after a certain age, please link it!

I think the problem here is that there have been numerous studies that have shown ethinylestradiol increases stroke risk at any age, and that the risk gets worse with age. As a result, it's unethical to do studies on older women with ethinylestradiol because the risk of death or major disability is simply too great to ever be approved by an ethics committee. So you're just never going to see such a study. One problem with that decision, though, is that these studies were done decades ago with much higher doses of ethinylestradiol than you see in the third and fourth generation birth control pills that are used today. So they don't know if these lower doses increase stroke risk. But due to the above points, it's doubtful that they can ever get approval to test it. They did examine this with the massive turn of the century HERS study, and they found stroke risk increased 40% for women with high blood pressure, and 28% for women with normal blood pressure. High blood pressure is pretty common among menopausal woman, with 54% of women aged 40-54 having high blood pressure, and 75% of women older than 60 having high blood pressure. High blood pressure puts more strain on your arteries and veins, making a stroke more likely. I know there are many reasons now why the HERS study is questionable, such as that they tended to choose women who had never been on HRT nor had any negative symptoms of menopause, and they also focused on women older than 60 who had been menopausal a long time. So those problems were to a certain extent an artifact of starting HRT at too old of an age after too many years of menopause. But the increased stroke risk with oral estrogen (they used oral premarin for the study, not ethinylestradiol. Ethinylestradiol may have a worse stroke risk than oral premarin) in menopausal women was demonstrated, and this might be the last study that is able to be ethically done on menopausal women and HRT of this magnitude, for quite some time.

As for a study that explains how ethinylestradiol increases stroke risk, here's an explanation: when ethinylestradiol, or any oral estrogen, is processed by the liver, it increases quantities of clotting factors II, VII, X, XII, factor VIII, and fibrinogen. Appears to be worse with ethinylestradiol than with other oral estrogens."
10vgaah,">The same reason most medical decisions are made. CYA (cover your...arse) and fear of malpractice claims. 

ABSOLUTELY! Thank you for stating what was kinda my point, but hoping I was wrong!

""Also, what is an acceptable risk to feel better?""

NOW HERE WAS MY REAL POINT!!!! This is it exactly! I should be able to make that call for MY BODY and LIFE!  Viagra has been associated with heat attacks, strokes even death.....but you don't see any Dr.s shying away from prescribing this RX to a man of ANY advanced age!!!  And now it's even available through places like ROMAN!!! The gender double standard in just about everything, but especially in the medical community/arena is getting REALLY OLD!!! 

If you are a healthy woman in her 50's who takes care of herself otherwise, why can't I have the option???  I hate to say this, but I can tell you right now if i had unlimited access to money, I could find a Dr. who would prescribe it!"
10vgaah,"Actually I was just reading about oral, non-contraceptive HRT and it IS prescribed to women of all ages. It's even listed as the most studied route of administration in the NAMS 2022 position statement. Oral delivery of HRT is listed as one of the acceptable forms of HRT with the caveat about stroke (and gallbladder disease). And it's the oral route of administration as far as they can tell, not the estrogen/progesterone type itself, that increases the risk of stroke/gallbladder issues. So really it's a fair question, why can women age 56 be given oral HRT, but not oral bcp as HRT?

edit: instead of downvoting, why not just say ""huh good point, let's all look into it""? It's a much smarter move to investigate than to parrot info that doesn't pass the sniff test."
10vgaah,"What dose pill were you on, by the way? Or what kind of pill?"
10vgaah,"I read that exact paper about clotting factor concentration and attributed it to the oral delivery and compared it to women on other oral formulations of estrogen as well. And ethinyl estradiol was included in the global studies, it was pooled with the CEE (premarin) oral tablet group, so there were older women taking lower doses of ethinyl estradiol - though because of age, no attribution could be made to specific causes. In fact they wrote that in the NAMS 2022 position statement - so little research they don't actually know if it is first-pass, first-pass of a specific hormone, or first-pass plus concentration. 

I feel like with the amount of data they have, numerically distinguishing data from each oral prep group could be done, even if the stats turn out shitty because of the confounding factors."
10vgaah,"I mean, there are black market options, often used by transgender people. But I am not that adventurous. 

As was just in a few recent articles, you may be sure if Men experienced Menopause, there would be sooo much more research into it, and so many more treatment options.

Yes, menopause is a natural body process, not a disease. So is aging, but you may be sure if there was a treatment option out there for it, plenty of people would be availing themselves of it. Same with going grey and/or losing your hair. I could go on for a long while on this particular tangent.

If I could opt out of menopause completely for a couple of decades I would be right in line for that. I get that some, maybe even the majority of women welcome not having to deal with periods, contraception, pregnancy scares...but there are some of us that want no part of 'the change' and would welcome some options. /endrant"
10vgaah,"It was low dose monophasic combo pill 0.1 mg levonorgestrel; 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol. The names changes but were marketed under Vienva, it actually had a chewable available called Tyblume.

Thank you for seeing my point. I am finding most women are just ""taking"" what they are being told by their docs or otherwise as gospel. I just refuse! I have learned the hard way with dealing with my husband's health ( he had a rare lung cancer that was diagnosed as Valley Fever for over a year!!!) and also caring for my aging parents and their health, that one must be their OWN MEDICAL ADVOCATE!!!  However, when it comes to this issue, I cannot seem to break through to any one to just write me script for the damn pills and I'll take the risks! But I'll continue to try! Meno is no joke, and it has impacted me greatly. I have my own business and after I was off the pill, the effects really impacted it. The low energy, mood issues, digestive issues, joint pain, libido loss (sharp drop!) sleeplessness and ridiculous brain fog - and it continues to this day. I take supplements to help, but I also know if I had the pills, I'd be myself again. And I KNOW this for FACT, b/c I actually did an experiment with the pills. To KNOW I was in meno, my gyno suggested I go off, which at the time i didn't really argue as I had not yet experienced any of the terrible meno issues, and I just didn't even think anyting of it. In fact, I was excited to go off, b/c I had been on them so long. And my gyno actually said I would feel so much better being off ""synthetics"". So, ok...but  I still had more left to my last script, so I just continued to fill them and kept them. Well, after the MISERABLE 12+ mos. of no BC pills, no period and blood tests confirmed I was indeed in meno. There were so many times i wanted to reach for those pills, but I also wanted there to be no question in determining whether I was indeed in meno. I  then began taking my pills again and LOW AND BEHOLD I WAS BACK!, and let me tell you it was IMMEDIATE!!! Unfortunately, that was short lived, as I eventually ran out, of course - but there was MY OWN STUDY!!!

However, regardless of the actual studies that have been done, more is coming to light now that women are speaking out loud about meno, and it's, IMO, making most studies more useless than helpful.  Actually, they seem to just lead me to more questions.  And let's be honest, there is not enough money in this field for any pharma or otherwise to do any extensive, meaningful studies. And I'll say it again, if this was anything that impacted men, we'd have real answers if not real solutions! Ironically enough it does affect men indirectly, but most deal with that by finding a younger woman!!! LOL!"
10vgaah,"FYI: there is a birth control patch with ethinylestradiol (Xulane), and the clotting risk is higher with it than with either oral ethinylestradiol or estradiol patches. https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna8565177"
10jjd3j,"This happened to me in the beginning. I know ‚Äúadrenal fatigue‚Äù is considered by many to be a woo-woo non-condition, but I sure tracked for it. Years of using adrenaline to fuel me started to backfire in my mid to late 40s leaving me more paralyzed than energized. 

It sounds like you might work with kind people, people who know you know you‚Äôre shaky and so they don‚Äôt say anything. It only added to my stress to have people point it out. 

I am glad you have a doctor‚Äôs appointment.

I think other things like caffeine and food restriction or exercising or sugar can start to hit us differently. I was always kind of a Type B look-for-the-easy-way-out kind of person but I‚Äôve still had to rest and recover more than I used to, to get better results. To basically be kinder to myself."
10jjd3j,If you are really concerned go ease your mind and talk to doctor.   I know my anxiety comes from my Hoshimoto‚Äôs thyroid issues and this.  But I also learned to hide it because I have figured out the big triggers.  If it‚Äôs this bad you may need to see someone or talk to someone.
10jjd3j,"I can relate to your experience.  In my case I can say now 6 years later that it was hormonal shifts as I plummeted into peri.  I think they don‚Äôt really see your suffering since they are focusing on their own stuff.  In some cases they may see it but are willfully blind to it because they are focusing on their own stuff, feel uncomfortable asking about it, or just don‚Äôt want to know.  I had a manager in my office one morning kvetching about work stuff and I was shaking and barely hanging on.  A tear rolled down my face.  He was right in front of me, about 2 feet away, face to face, and never acknowledged it and just kept right on talking.  
You are not broken or weak.  This is a chemical reaction and hopefully you can get treated and get back to kicking butt at work.   I was an engineer for 26 years and had I known at the time that this was chemistry and not a broken mind, I might still be one."
10jjd3j,"Oh, I wish adrenal fatigue was recognized now. I have spent years trying to figure out my problem, doing my best in exercise,  nutrition, etc. But also working like a demon.  

Burnout during peri-menopause, no doctors giving hrt, and now no energy to function beyond a minimal degree. 

I think people turn a blind eye so they don't have to deal with things that they are afraid of. And believe me, they are afraid of middle age women, mental health struggles, and anything menopause related."
10jjd3j,"I‚Äôm only at the start of peri (which I didn‚Äôt know existed until I saw discussions on Reddit), but I have dealt with occasional anxiety episodes over the past decade. If it‚Äôs legal where you are, I have found CBD gummies to be just as effective for me as when my dr prescribed lorazepam, and the gummies are way easier to get here."
10jjd3j,"Talk to your doctor about meds.  For me, some anxiety meds and birth control pills have made a world of difference.  But it took me a while to find the right bc pill - the first one I was a rage beast.  The second I was a weeping mess.  Third time's the charm..."
10jjd3j,"People are probably too wrapped up in their own worries to notice, honestly. In most workplaces it seems like you have to be literally swinging from the chandelier before anyone notices you're imploding from mental health issues. 

When I worked in academia, the third floor copy room was where everybody went to weep. When I worked in kitchens, it was the walk-in freezer. We were all in crisis all the time and pretending that was normal. Annoyingly, that meant it took longer than it should have for me to notice perimenopause symptoms. Legit thought it was ""just stress"" for like three years. 

Anyway. No, people at work probably can't tell. But also yes, this SUCKS."
10jjd3j,"Sounds a lot like hyperthyroidism.
 Definitely need to consult a doctor ."
10jjd3j,"Oh I hear you so much. Look at my posts you can probably relate.

Anxiety is my main and most horrible symptom, closely followed by insomnia and only then sweaty nights and muscle pain and fatigue and brain issues and whatnot.

Hormonal anxiety doesn‚Äôt seem to respond to meds (didnt for me at least). What works at least a little and slowly is other techniques. Exercise daily, accept and allow (the DARE approach or AWAKE exercise is nice), passive acceptance that you are in a bad way right now and it will pass like everything passes‚Ä¶

I am practicing this now for six months and at least the days have become much better, the nights are still very uncomfortable but not a horrible nightmare anymore.

Hopefully one day SOON this will pass and we can be occasionally happy again. And wild women! As soon as this passes, I will throw out all the stops and live and be grateful and try to be a help to others as well. I now have an inkling how precious evey moment that is good is."
10jjd3j,"I feel like that all the time. The few times I've mentioned it to a trusted coworker he was surprised.  I think people are generally too distracted with their own performance to notice much. 

I have a few coworkers who went through different health scares including a mastectomy and full hysterectomy - I know now she went through a lot at the time with anxiety and depression but never noticed anything that different in her behavior at the time."
10jjd3j,"it's possible you have a vitamin/mineral deficiency that makes you *feel* like you have anxiety. The formula that works for me is a 50+ Women's multivitamin, B-Complex, Magnesium glycinate, D3+K and acv in my drinking water."
10jjd3j,"I had horrible anxiety.  Horrible.  Slowly creeped up over the years when peri started.  It really escalated when I was put on hormones.  I couldn‚Äôt drive, I worried about crazy stuff, couldn‚Äôt walk to the mailbox, eat or sleep it was really bad.  I got taken off the hormones and it helped a lot but I still had some irrational anxiety.  I finally got put on progesterone only and it‚Äôs gone.  Thank God!!!  You can look at my old posts, there‚Äôs a lot!  I really suffered.  Anxiety is a very common symptom for some of us.  Anti-anxiety meds don‚Äôt work if it‚Äôs hormonal anxiety.  I‚Äôm not saying to not try but I would have your hormones looked at first.  Don‚Äôt wait 2 weeks, just go as soon as you can.  Your going to be ok you just have to figure it out.  Also caffeine makes it much much worse."
10jjd3j,"Oh my god the anxiety. I hear you. I use mine as a way to make peace with death, it sounds morbid, but it‚Äôs been my only hope during really intense panic attacks: I die to them. When they come I understand it as a deepening of my capacity. I have a handful of supplements that help too, happy to share!"
10jjd3j,"Apparently women who‚Äôve never had panic attacks before can get them during peri menopause and this is relatively common. When certain hormones plummet, so do some of your feel-good chemicals which can trigger anxiety and panic attacks. Treatable with estrogen and/or antidepressants. They recommend estrogen first because it‚Äôs easier to cease or change doses."
10jjd3j,You may need hormomes
10jjd3j,"I know meds aren‚Äôt the answer for everyone, but I‚Äôve always had anxiety and have taken an antidepressant for 20 years and it was manageable. A couple years ago when the peri symptoms started I was crying at work all the time and it was out of control.  My doc added a mood stabilizer and it made a world of difference for me.  I also went through all the modules of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) in weekly appointments with a therapist and those skills have really helped me too and are a good alternative to medication."
10jjd3j,"I‚Äôm 100% with you in adrenal fatigue. I know it‚Äôs considered just a BS ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù but damn it makes sense for me. I suspect twenty years from now it will be like fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: from ‚Äújust an anxious/weak woman issue‚Äù to ‚Äúoh wait, maybe it‚Äôs actually a legitimate disease that we‚Äôve been gaslighting women about for decades‚Äù. I get absolutely panicky at the idea my daughter could suffer anything like I (and we ladies here) have. I just pray (and I‚Äôm an atheist!) that medicine catches up to women‚Äôs‚Äô reality SOON."
10jjd3j,"I just had to Google this... and it explains so. freaking. much. My whole adult life has been one big stress-fest. Poverty, abuse (in many different forms), medical issues with kids, pregnancies and miscarriages, major life changes... wow."
10jjd3j,"I definitely need medical advice, I have an appointment in two weeks.  

Just trying to hold it together until then."
10jjd3j,Oh and I was gonna say: you are likely doing/coping way better than you think you are.  The others might not notice your struggle because you are still a star despite how you feel.  The anxiety mind lies about your performance.
10jjd3j,"Great.  I'm scary for the first time in my life and I'm too tired to use my power for good!

I googled adrenal fatigue briefly and it's funny that something that doesn't exist describes my life so well.  I'm going to read up on that more when I get home."
10jjd3j,"Thanks, I know so many people who have found relief with those.  CBD hasn't worked for me, but THC in small doses does...I just can't use it while at work."
10jjd3j,"I know, I have a doctor's appointment in 2 weeks.

I've never been able to take hormonal bc due to migraines, but I hope there is something she can do."
10jjd3j,"I can actually feel it happening to me now. I‚Äôm getting better and better and managing it but sometimes get off my routine or something happens to me that is out of my control and I can feel the surge, feel my heart start fluttering, feel weak and like I can‚Äôt catch my breath. Sucks. Had one just yesterday that felt like I‚Äôd made no progress at all but realized what I‚Äôd done to make it flare and was able to calm myself down.

Beta blockers work but they also make me nervous. I have to watch reflux and propranolol can trigger reflux. I‚Äôm so conflicted about starting down the medication path ‚Äî concerned one thing will trigger another thing. Sigh. 

Anyways, nice to hear from you. I‚Äôve read in at least one of your comments you feel there is some validity to this idea ‚Äî emboldened me to speak up :)"
10jjd3j,"Speaking as someone diagnosed with ME/CFS and fibro, which caused a delay of a QUARTER OF A CENTURY in getting diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (I probably don't have fibro, we don't know yet about the ME/CFS), the misdiagnosis rate for both is through the roof. There's still sod all treatment for either, as people with ME/CFS caused by covid are learning the hard way. And they're highly stigmatised, which crashes the rest of your healthcare. Life expectancy is 25 years shorter with ME/CFS, and I think most of it is because doctors stop looking for other conditions and miss the heart disease, cancer and so forth. Certainly that's what has happened with my friends dying young with it. 

Adrenal fatigue doesn't exist. Seeing a list of symptoms you can relate to doesn't mean it's real. If you pursue something that isn't real and stop going to doctors, you are going to miss whatever is actually causing those symptoms.

If you can tell you have a serious condition that's being missed and you start guessing at what it is, this is useful, but you are not a doctor and you are not going to guess right 100% of the time. I figured out they were missing things, and asked for referrals for some conditions I suspected. I guessed right for two out of four, which is a good success rate. Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, yes, lupus, no, MS, no, EDS, yes. 

If I'd gone down the ""adrenal fatigue, take lots of supplements"" path, I'd have missed these, and possibly ended up with liver damage from supplements. Indeed, I did go down the woo path for years, my family was heavily into it, and that's one reason why I've been getting major diagnoses over twenty years late. I'm still horrified that an osteopath who was literally putting my subluxed joints back into position missed the EDS. She said my treatments funded her new American-style fridge-freezer. 

These days, long covid is always a likely option, so I'd start there."
10jjd3j,"I'm glad you're going to see your doctor. Do you need to take a few days off work? Don't think about whether the project is urgent, stop and think about whether you are able to work right now. If your job will allow sick leave, you sound like you could do with some. Anxiety is absolutely a genuine medical problem that people need to take time off work for, and whether it's hormonal in origin or not is for you and your doctor to work out, not your employer.

(I'm too disabled to work, but I have these conversations with my partner sometimes when he needs a sick day and is too anxious to think his way through it.)"
10jjd3j,Look into copper and adrenal fatigue. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10jjd3j,"I know, right?"
10y7ap2,"I started at 37, too.  The wiki is awesome.  Read all you can. Too many docs will mis-treat, mis-diagnose perimenopause, so you have to really know what‚Äôs going on and advocate for yourself.  Hang in there. This is the greatest sub out there- full of awesome, helpful, knowledgeable women!"
10y7ap2,"Please read through this thread..[.Is this perimenopause](/r/Menopause/comments/xubqk2/is_this_perimenopause_read_this_first/)?  And also check out our [Menopause Wiki](/r/Menopause/wiki/index) as there's a long symptom list.  

Also there is no hormonal test to diagnose perimenopause.  But it's definitely recommended to get your thyroid checked."
10y7ap2,"Night sweats with the onset of my period, thinner consistency of blood, fewer days of flow , and chin hairs were my indicator. My mom went into menopause at 40 so I feel ‚Äòlucky‚Äô I‚Äôm still bleeding. 

I‚Äôm an acupuncturist so I gave myself herbal formulas and Mayan abdominal massage, which have helped with libido/ cramps & clots, mood. I could be doing more, but it‚Äôs as that saying goes: the cobbler‚Äôs children have no shoes. Having said that, I think acupuncture & traditional asian medicine has so much to offer us."
10y7ap2,"Hi! I started perimenopause at 36. My cycles gradually got longer, periods shorter, night sweats, mood swings, and brain fog. My OBGYN said it totally can start in your 30s. They ran PCOS labs and did and ultrasound to rule out other possible diagnoses."
10y7ap2,"You may have PBC, another autoimmune disease which itching is a common symptom"
10y7ap2,Yes I‚Äôve been reading lots of posts! So much good information! Thank you!
10y7ap2,Wow I‚Äôm reading through the symptoms. This is so helpful!! It‚Äôs crazy because for me so many overlap with MS symptoms! But I have so many on that list. I‚Äôm definitely bringing it up to my gyno and neurologist. Thank you!
10y7ap2,I didn‚Äôt have any issues until I stopped taking birth control (blood pressure issues) so I‚Äôm guessing that helped keep my hormones in balance? I didn‚Äôt get chin hair until I stopped it about a year ago üò© but now I‚Äôve seen most of these symptoms and so many are like MS and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been blaming it on. So now I‚Äôm playing a guessing game on what to blame lol.
10y7ap2,That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening to me and then some üò© definitely bringing it up when I see them!
10y7ap2,"Right? So many of us have multimorbidity where symptoms overlap, and medications conflict, etc.  The best thing to help untangle it all, is to track symptoms as best you can with as much detail as possible. Then look for patterns over a period of time.  It's like we have to become our own data analysts.  And trust our instincts."
10y7ap2,Yes most definitely! I had suspicion of it the last couple years but how I feel lately along with the pattern of my periods I‚Äôm leaning toward perimenopause. There‚Äôs nothing that can be done before it‚Äôs actual menopause correct?
10y7ap2,">There‚Äôs nothing that can be done before it‚Äôs actual menopause correct?

In what way?  Do you mean to help with symptoms, or regulate periods etc?"
10y7ap2,Hormone replacement? basically you don‚Äôt do HRT until you‚Äôre fully menopausal? Ive been reading about the importance of estrogen when you have MS because it protects the nerve sheaths or something along those lines. So I‚Äôm definitely going to go that route when it‚Äôs required.
10y7ap2,"Waiting until full menopause (aka post-meno) before starting MHT/HRT is a common myth and many doctors continue to spout this nonsense.  

Symptoms are occurring because of the hormonal fluctuations and ultimate decline.  So it's recommended to start MHT during peri, not only to help with symptoms, but also provide protective benefits to bone, brain and heart health.  Again, just track things, and if symptoms become worse to the point where you feel they are disrupting your quality of life, then talk to your doctor about MHT.  Otherwise, if it's just irregular periods that are causing grief, then you could consider some kind of birth control (Mirena IUD, etc) which can better regulate or eliminate periods entirely."
10y7ap2,Do you think it‚Äôs better to talk to your gyno or a gp about it? Sorry üò£so many questions lol.
10y7ap2,"Depends where you live...in Canada we usually see our GP, but in the states it seems to be gyno. But for either it almost always involves being direct and ask specifically for what you want, and go in prepared to argue your points."
10y7ap2,Thanks so much! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
10fqvjv,"I don't see this mentioned a lot, but my sense of smell has really heightened with peri. I'm the only one in the house who can always smell if a burner went out, I'm the only one who can smell the lingering grease on my food industry worker sons clean clothing, I'm the one everyone comes to if they want to know if a food has turned.

So just throwing out that if your husband and friend both say you don't smell, it might just be that your sense of smell has gone up and you're smelling things others can't. Basically, don't worry, you're probably fine!"
10fqvjv,"I remember being pregnant and super sensitive to smells that I never noticed when not pregnant.   The bathroom at work reeked, but it really didn't.  I wonder if similarly you don't actually smell bad, your sense of smell is heightened by the hormonal changes.   Is that a thing?"
10fqvjv,[deleted]
10fqvjv,"Hi - for question 1 - try a heavy duty acid toner for face applied on armpits. The stink is not the sweat but bacteria that feeds on sweat. The toner will take care of bacteria. I like p50 lotion, pricey, but better than stinking! For question 2b - it will absolutely do! :)!"
10fqvjv,"Hormonal changes' supposedly cause permanent changes in body odor. (Everywhere, not just underarms.)

I am %1000 convinced I smell different *and* worse than I used to. Fighting the stink is a frustrating and ongoing issue."
10fqvjv,"I do not have anyone to bounce this off of but I swear I‚Äôm less stinky when I guzzle hibiscus tea. My theory is it‚Äôs astringent. But possibly because I drink more when I have something flavored, it‚Äôs keeping me more hydrated and that helps, although other flavors of tea don‚Äôt seem as pronounced an improvement."
10fqvjv,"1-- do you have that crystal deodorant where you live?
https://www.thecrystal.com/products/mineral-deodorant-stick-unscented


I've used it and it works really well. Lasts a really long time, too. You wet the stick, and apply. I go back and forth between that and Dove unscented. Most regular antiperspirants have aluminum-free versions now, I think. I went a couple days before, using nothing, and I smelled like onions.


Edit for formatting. It originally looked like I was yelling ü§£"
10fqvjv,An alcohol spray is great for freshening up you armpits.
10fqvjv,Our sense of smell can go off the charts during peri and menopause. I smell like a ditch to me but my husband smells nothing wrong with me. Hang in there. It may just be you smelling you. Persimmon soap helps.
10fqvjv,"‚ÄúIt Just Works!‚Äù or other chlorophyll-type pills. Lume deodorant & wash. Also, Mirai Clinical persimmon wash. It counteracts ‚Äúold person smell‚Äù (nonenal). Not that that‚Äôs what you sound like you have but I‚Äôm 55 and I live in fear of one day developing that smell. Fortunately I don‚Äôt have it but I am ever-vigilant."
10fqvjv,"I'm now fully menopausal and I no longer have the strong body smells, but I did. My armpits began to smell like acrid coffee and I tried everything. I used anti perspirant though so can't help with just deodorant. I used men's products which seemed stronger and were cheaper too Fs. Anyway that's no use to you. I just wanted to say that I no longer have those issues with smells above or down below since becoming fully menopausal. It's been nearly a year and a half. So there is hope!"
10fqvjv,"My scent changed with peri. It drove me nuts. My husband I insisted that nothing had changed, but I still don‚Äôt believe him.

I use a Nivea roll-on antiperspirant every couple of days."
10fqvjv,"Many women swear by Native deodorant but I have yet to try it.

I tried the lavendar Lume stick under my arms and it works the best so far for me for aluminum-free. But I still resort to Secret Clinical when I have to lecture / present."
10fqvjv,"There‚Äôs no point consulting my husband on matters of the nose, he can‚Äôt smell anything generally. It‚Äôs probably something that happens to older men for this very reason. I‚Äôm a sweaty, ripe mess."
10fqvjv,I caved and bought Lume unscented stick. I work out and sweat a lot in my groin area.  I use the stick there and don‚Äôt stink down below anymore!
10fqvjv,"Having this exact problem. The BO is out of control and I never had that problem before. I just tried the brand Lume, which seems to be helping a little. I do find I need to apply it twice a day, which is sort of a pain. ü´†"
10fqvjv,Lume deodorant and body wash.
10fqvjv, The megababe space bar and crystal deodorant combo are unbeatable - even my husband who has a physical job uses it & has no smell.
10fqvjv,"There used to be a prescription called Drysol, but I think it was discontinued - because who cares about women's health needs? (sarcasm)"
10fqvjv,Akt deodorant balm is my lifesaver
10fqvjv,"1.  Stay hydrated 

2.  I went thru a phase where my feet stank. The only thing that worked to kill the odor was Vagisil wash odor block. I washed my feet, pits & groin area with that & it helped. (It has a very mild scent so you don‚Äôt smell like a spring meadow)

3.  I‚Äôve seen persimmon soap recommended here as an odor killer. It‚Äôs a popular item in the Japanese & Korean beauty markets & available on Amazon. (I haven‚Äôt tried this one yet) 

4.  Lum√©. I bought a sample packet of body washes& deoderant solids & lotions when they went on sale at Labor Day & have had good luck with them 

& yeah, I‚Äôve also gone the Old Spice route because dove &suave don‚Äôt  survive a hot flash"
10fqvjv,"I use salt deodorant.  It's literally a salt block.  I love it.  Can't use it in the Summer though.  Its not the best antiperspirant, but it's great for deodorant!"
10fqvjv,"I feel like I stink more, I never had to wear deodorant on a regular basis.  Now I do.  

There are tons of aluminum free deodorants out there these days some don't really work, some do.  

I know smelling Old Spice on myself would make me even more angry then I am right now.  But that might just be me."
10fqvjv,"Thanks for the tips everyone - I will check them out. Looks like a strike of lime costs $35 in my part of Canada. At that price I'm kind of thinking ""so what if I'm a bit smelly?!"""
10fqvjv,"I really like the Lume deodorant.    I watched their ads for over a year, I finally ordered it on a whim.    After using it for about a month, I can honestly say...it works.    It's supposed to not cover smells but actually prevents the bacteria responsible for bad smells.   It's also supposed to be free of some of the more controversial ingredients.        Cons:   It's ridiculously expensive (22.00 a tube).  They don't smell great.   Meaning when you take the lid off the product, it's not a yummy smell like traditional deodorants.  It doesn't smell bad, just not great   Pros:  It works and can be used ANYWHERE.  It doesn't take a lot to get results.   I use a larger pea sized amount to cover my pits, thigh crease and under boob area.   Again, it works well and no need to reapply during the day.    Pro tip:  it's a lotion-y consistency even in the traditional deodorant dispenser.  I find it a better buy in the tube.      

TDLR--Lume is expensive and it works."
10fqvjv,Lume maybe
10fqvjv,"OMG, I thought I was literally hallucinating smells...maybe I wasn't/am not. Historically I don't usually have a good sense of smell."
10fqvjv,I wish so much this worked for me! I bought two bottles of the liquid tincture with no results - what kind do you use??
10fqvjv,"This is so strange - I used to drink hibiscus tea on the reg and only after reading your comment, did I realize that my stink started being noticeable after I stopped drinking it daily.  Looks like I‚Äôll be going back to my regular evening cup.  üòÑ"
10fqvjv,Can confirm: been using crystal deodorant for 25 years. One stick will last a year!! Each application lasts 24 hours! Can't beat it.
10fqvjv,"FYI, the reason it works is because the crystal has aluminum in it. It's potassium aluminum sulfate. It's not eliminating aluminum from going on your skin."
10fqvjv,"I use this too! Since my 20s. It used to last days for me but after my 2nd pregnancy I had to start using it every day (like regular deodorant).

10xiau4,"I work in healthcare. About 5 years ago, I really started to wonder what the hell was going on. My job dissatisfaction went way up, before the huge staffing shortages, before COVID, and I finally realized. It was the higher number of baby boomer patients.  I wish I could share more specifics, but they are a whole other ball of wax compared to the previous generations I treated. 
My parents are also boomers. They know they did things wrong raising their kids, but refuse to apologize or change. I don‚Äôt get it. 3 LC kids and multiple LC grandkids doesn‚Äôt seem to sway them either. They leaned more hippie in their younger years (I‚Äôm the oldest, I remember) but now everything that is broken is someone else‚Äôs fault. Someone else‚Äôs happiness lessens their happiness even when it doesn‚Äôt affect them at all. They both retired early, own their home, and have plenty, but they are so focused on what‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with this world. 
I don‚Äôt get it either."
10xiau4,Completely agree and feel the same way.
10xiau4,"It is because unless you are so severely injured or ill you honestly cannot direct your thoughts at all (extreme pain, heavily sedated, psychedelic drugs, later stage dementia, severe tbi and the like) - unless this happens to you and I pray it never does to any, you can always learn to change. But you must WANT it first. And this is what most don‚Äôt. It takes being willing to accept you are wrong, for instance. Have dysfunctional ideas, beliefs, thought patterns. Change them through diligent hard work. It truly is hard but that‚Äôs no excuse not to do it."
10xiau4,"This is very thought provoking way of trying to understand other humans. And a lesson to us all to keep ourselves in check, I had a friend same age as me (46) visiting me for a week. By day 3 I realized she hadn‚Äôt showered and had started to stink (it‚Äôs hot here) I went off on her but at the same time challenged her and myself about habits that might point us to cognitive decline. She appreciated being called out and is taking better care of herself physically, mentally and emotionally."

10xiau4,"UGHHHH. Can we please not turn this sub into another one full of ageism and ""generational war"" division? It is so tiresome and so not helpful. You understand, of course, that the younger generations are saying the same thing about Gen X, right? We have PLENTY of Trumpers and bigots/racists horrible people in our generation as well, but they don't exemplify all 65 million of us (in the US alone). The same can be said about the boomers and every other generation that came before and after it.

10xiau4," I feel for you. <3 I worked in health care back in the late 90s as a trial run to see if that is what  I really wanted to go into as a career. I chose not to.  I felt a SLIGHT reprieve when all of my grandparents finally passed, but then 2016 happened. I come from a mostly southern, military, conservative, republican family, so I was used to a lot of it, but it just seems to get worse by the year, and not matter how many times or way we explain it, they refuse to understand. I'm exhausted. :("
10xiau4,"Exactly.  I have only seen the behaviors in people my mother's age. I am just trying to understand humans and our differences.  I am getting a lot of push back from my mother and her sister about how I am making more of my symptoms than I should, but I seem to find more empathy from my cousin, who is just a few years younger than me and a former co-worker who is about eight years older than me."
10xiau4,"I don't think it's everyone...but there seems to be a shift. And no, I don't think ALL younger folks are saying the same about Gen X people. There are horrible people in every age group, but there is also proof that my parent's generation has a lot of issues. I am simply speaking from my own experience. I am by no means trying to start any generational war, far from it, I am TRYING to understand why they behave the way they do and what leads them to have their behaviors.If you don't like what  I  post or disagree or are just not having the same experience if you have nothing constructive to add, please feel free to ignore me or block my profile so that my personal experience doesn't upset you.

10hd2y5,"I'm so sorry that that goddamn zipper didn't cooperate! How dare it do that to you! 

If you can even for 5 seconds close your eyes and take one deep breath in, you have won the battle for today. Hugs."
10hd2y5,"I sew.  Maybe I can help. 

Take yourself on a field trip to the local fabric store.  Ask them for a product called 'double sided quilter tape'. 

Bring a roll of that home.  apply a layer of that to the upper and lower part of your zipper tape. 

Set the tape with an iron (careful not to burn yourself or melt your zipper!) 

Better is if you have a hair straightener to set it with.  goes much faster. 

Let the tape cool. (voice of experience!)

Now, take the other bit of backing off, and position the zipper in the zipper channel of your hoodie as desired.

Press down firmly on the garment's zipper channel. Use a hair dryer to set the adhesive on both sides.  Let the whole shebang cool. 

Stitch your zipper into place, back stitching at the ends.  Quilters tape adhesive is meant to not gum up your sewing machine or your needles, so there's no worries there. 

I recently did this on a vintage leather jacket..and it came out great!

I hope this helps!  Good luck!"
10hd2y5,"As I was driving this afternoon, a car slowly passed by in the next lane. Out of the passenger side window was a small child‚Äôs hand, surfing the waves of wind, completely carefree, and I got emotional. I shared this with a friend and, as I spoke, I started crying. This crazy wave of weepiness comes over me when I‚Äôm about to start my period now. It‚Äôs only been happening the past few months; if this shit is going to continue for years, I‚Äôm gonna need to speak to the manager."

I never mastered the zipper! Or the buttonhole! I figure thats why they made elastic! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it I just always get frustrated when I use my machine. I should really take a course.
10hd2y5,"Oh I said plenty of those but mostly I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. I swear the sewing machine hates me!

I hope you feel better too. I think tonight I‚Äôm going to watch as many videos as I can find lol."

10hd2y5,">I don‚Äôt understand the disrespect that zipper has for me.

Zippers give everyone the side eye and egg people on.

I sew and had a long-standing fear of invisible zippers, but once I learned a couple of tricks, it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared. I tamed that bad boy.

As for your hoodie zipper, using a zipper foot really helps so that part of the foot isn't riding on top of the zipper teeth and is just on the flat zipper tape part. Alternatively, some machines allow you to shift the needle to the far right or left, which might allow you to get close enough. If you're still having trouble, check out r/sewhelp."
10hd2y5,"your zipper foot edges are supposed to be close to the zipper teeth.  Some zipper feet are adjustable (such as what you'll see with some vintage Singer sewing machines, for example) and some are static, but the needle position on the machine itself is adjustable (such as what you'll see with some modern computerized sewing machines). 


I'll tell you what.  DM me a photo of your project and your presser foot, and tell me what machine you're sewing with, and I'll see what I can do to get you sorted. 

 As far as taking a course goes, I'd recommend calling up your local industrial or antique sewing machine mechanic.  Yes, they do exist!   Those guys, they'll know where to send you, or they may give you a lesson right there on the spot.  Either way. 

You can do this!!"

10hd2y5,Would be so fucking awesome
10hd2y5,"It's worth trying again with the proper zipper foot. 

And as hard as this is, it does get better. Plus, the mental stimulation of figuring this out is guarding against dementia. Gotta look on the bright side."
10hd2y5,Actually cackled MAWHAAHAHA
10m0914,"I have been taking Trazodone 100 mg nightly as needed for 10 years , not from perimenopause, just from having insomnia issues for many years . No problems / side effects ."
10m0914,I've taken 25 mg of traz a night for ten years. No tolerance build up. I'd be clinically insane from lack of sleep without it.
10m0914,"I take 50 mg on an as needed basis with no issue. My doctor told me the same thing. That you CAN use it as needed but better to take it nightly. Like you, I do not want to build up a tolerance and also I don‚Äôt like being dependent on sleep medications.  I probably average about 3-4 nights during the week I need to take it and this is mainly during my pms weeks. 

I would say the only very minor issue is that occasionally I will feel a bit groggier the next day if I go too many days without taking it, but moving around helps the grogginess wear off."
10m0914,I have taken 100mg every night for over 10 years.  I started when I had horrible PPD/PPA after having my son and couldn‚Äôt sleep due to panic attacks. Plus he had some feeding issues and had to be fed every 2 hours 24 hours a day and it helped me not be too knocked out..but still be able to sleep in between feedings.  I haven‚Äôt had any side effects or anything.
10m0914,"Me too, long term user for sleep. I actually cut my 50 mg pills in half and that‚Äôs enough. If it‚Äôs not i‚Äôll cut a half in half and take 12.5 mg more. 100 mg makes me groggy the next day."
10m0914,25 mg per night for 15 years. No problems whatsoever.
10m0914,"I took it years ago. It's a mild anti-depressant, but very sedating. You can take it as needed but only take it when you can get a good 7 to 8 hours of sleep or you'll be groggy in the the morning. It's non-habit forming and doesn't cause any withdrawal symptoms. It worked well for me at the time."
10m0914,"I have not taken it, but I have read about its use for insomnia and that, as others here are commenting, it works really well for that. 

To me it sounds possibly better than zolpidem (Ambien), which I have used in the past, or benzodiazepines, which I currently use. 

I also found this: 

Trazodone for Insomnia: A Systematic Review
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842888/"
10m0914,Yes you can. I personally hate it though it makes me feel drugged and groggy for hours the next morning.
10m0914,My special needs son (28) has been on 150 mg trazadone for probably 15 years now. His body wouldn't go to sleep without it.  He was on clonodine for several years as a child but his Dr switched him to trazadone. We have also tried otc sleep meds but they don't work as well.  It takes him a long time before he needs to try an increase. And a lot of it has to do with epilepsy meds that are new and so the trazadone needed an increase. I trust this med more than other meds he has been on. I hope it helps you!  I've been thinking of asking for some from my Dr for the same reason! Perimenopause is a bitch!
10m0914,"I say try it.  I did for a 1-2 weeks and it made me crazy depressed, and I still woke up in the middle of the night.  

But there are folks on here who it seems to work for.  You never know what your body will jive with."
10m0914,"Same here.

It's still working. I haven't developed a tolerance."
10m0914,Do the headaches eventually go away as it builds in your system?
10m0914,"Wait, what is this trazadone??? I took Ambien once for sleep and it was great for the few days I took it but then I stopped and insomnia was even worse so I swore I would never take that again."
10m0914,I took it last night but I'm still groggy this afternoon. Does this go away if I just use it nightly? I'd like to feel refreshed in the mornings. Lol
10m0914,"Thank you! Good to know. Yeah, my doc said it's ultimately up to me, but lol she kinda emphasized that I do it nightly so that it builds up in my system. I'm thinking that having it build up in my system will just result in it no longer working. 

How long have you been using trazodone this way?"
10m0914,"As an update: I've been taking the trazodone for about a week at 25 mg per night. I've had some side effects, but overall I like what it is doing for me. I wouldn't say it's keeping me asleep for more than, say, 5ish to 6 hours? I think it just depends on how long my body wants to sleep sometimes. But on the flipside, during the day I feel like I can power through. I couldn't do that before.

Anyway, I'm replying to your comment, in particular, because I've noticed that the drug ""mutes"" the adrenaline surges I used to get at night during sleep. I developed them from... I'm not sure... probably a combination of hormonal fluctuations and trauma, most likely.

In the course of your 10 years on trazodone, have you found that it continuously ""mutes""/helps that panic response? Because honestly, I'm loving that result more than whatever sleep I do or do not get. I finally feel normal again.

(I remember trying Prozac in 2021 and it hit me like black cocaine and gave me worse panic. Never again.)"
10m0914,Do the headaches eventually go away as it builds in your system?
10m0914,"Zolpidem is terrible. I used to have that too. It would knock me out, sure. I would sleep and wake up feeling great.

Then came the next night... with INSANE rebound insomnia (like, my actual insomnia is *nothing* compared to ambien **rebound** **insomnia**), plus withdrawals. I would get withdrawal symptoms from zolpidem after one use. *e.g. Jerking body movements, adrenaline rushes, the works.* It was awful. Never again."
10m0914,"Did either of you have grogginess or dizziness in the mornings after when you first started? I can‚Äôt seem to get past this and keep giving up on Trazodone, but am running out of options since Hydroxyzine doesn‚Äôt work for me anymore."
10m0914,It's an old school antidepressant that is so ridiculously sedating it's used off label as a sleep med. it doesn't carry any of the risks of the z meds and isn't addictive. I would write sonnets about it if I could. I'm about to take one right now.
10m0914,What dose? I take 25 mg. More than that and I am sluggish the whole next morning.
10m0914,"Funny my doctor was the exact same way! I asked my doctor about tolerance and she said it can take years to build it up, but I‚Äôm not so sure! I went down the rabbit hole of reading reviews and experiences, then decided to just go for it and see what happens. I started doing this in August 2022.  My routine is usually I‚Äôm turning off all lights and going to sleep at 10, if I am still awake at 11 or 1130, I take the traz, and usually out within 30 mins. I will still wake up in the night because I have to pee all the time but I‚Äôm able to go right back to sleep. I wake up at 7 for work, sometimes it‚Äôs harder to get up but I push myself to move around more if I‚Äôm feeling groggy and that helps. 

I really hope the trazodone helps you!! It has honestly been a great help to me when. I need it."
10m0914,It definitely helped.  Now after my surgical menopause in 2021..I have had some anxiety creep back in.  I still take it because I feel like it does help me fall asleep.  Staying asleep? Not so much.  I wake up a lot during the night. I would say keep with it! At least you are getting some rest!
10m0914,I found this thread because I was just rx‚Äôd this. I have been having the worst (suspected) adrenaline surges all night that keep me awake. Whenever I start to dose off I get awakened immediately by a sort or start feeling and a racing and/or palpitating heart. Finally went to er three days after hardly any sleep and they did chest X-ray and ekg as well as blood work and monitored me. Doc said trazodone might help but to follow up with cardio which I will. But I really think this is anxiety/adrenaline related because I am also coming off of my lexapro at the moment and it‚Äôs been hell. Will be reinstating that also. So‚Ä¶ it does help you will the feelings of adrenaline? I‚Äôm worried it will just make me even more tired but my heart will still be racing and keeping me up. üò≠ I‚Äôm desperate
10m0914,"I never had headaches with it. Sorry to hear that you are! The only side effects I‚Äôve had are a little grogginess the next day, especially if I don‚Äôt take it with a window of at least 8 hours for sleep."
10m0914,"Ooh that sounds very bad. Yes, stay away from it. I‚Äôve heard about other really negative experiences with it as well. It was ok for me but somehow it didn‚Äôt really solve my sleep issues."
10m0914,"I did. But I just went to bed earlier.

Eventually, it wasn't an issue. 

Edited to say it's really my only option now."
10m0914,"I asked my Dr. about this. I haven't started taking it, but my understanding is that you have to reduce the dose if this happens. I have heard of people dosing as low as 12.5. What is your dosage?"
10m0914,"Huh. I'm already on an antidepressant that I'm wanting to get off of buy my psychiatrist wants me to be mood-stabilized for a full year first. Also on an anti-anxiety med. So I'm not wanting to add another to the mix, oh well."
10m0914,"Lol I only took 25, too. It has been about 11 hours since I took it. I *kind of* feel a bit better now? Lol. Maybe my metabolism sucks."
10m0914,"Oh I see! 

I think I will just try to take it during my problem phases. (Namely that ovulation window when my estrogen spikes and there's very little progesterone to counter it because I haven't ovulated yet...)

 I seem to have issues staying asleep, but I fall asleep every night just fine. It's tricky to treat. I wonder if I should just cut a tab in half and take 25mg whenever I wake up at an ungodly hour and can't fall back asleep."
10m0914,"So, I actually have a similar issue. I will doze and then get a jolt of adrenaline that wakes me up. It's not a heart issue, it's a thing that can be caused by multiple factors. To quickly answer your question: trazodone made this go away. It ""muted"" my adrenaline bursts so to speak. But the drug... well... it did not work out for me. I took it for 11 days and it would knock me out, then maybe a few hours later I was wide awake, pretty energized and unable to fall back asleep. I was hungover/groggy after the first time taking it. I strongly recommend just cutting it in half (25 mg) or into quarters (12.5 mg) and starting low. Work your way up and see how it makes you feel. It will mute adrenaline as I said -- at least, it did for me. But it didn't let me fall back asleep.

As for the adrenaline surges, in my case they can be triggered by multiple things. Sleep deprivation, in of itself, will trigger these. They can also be triggered by indigestion/stomach issues. Sleep anxiety can also trigger them. Caffeine can also cause them to happen. And, yes, certain medications will trigger them... namely SSRI's like Fluoxetine or Lexapro. Not trazodone, in my case, because it is not an SSRI. It's a SARI and works differently.

Let me level with you and tell you that trazodone really didn't work for me. But if you're just trying to get rid of adrenaline surges, ask your doctor if they would be willing to let you try propranolol. It's a beta blocker. It is often prescribed for this exact issue. My doctor won't script it to me because my normal blood pressure is very low (90/65). So a beta blocker would reduce my bp even more, putting me in hypotension. I did, however, use propranolol in my 20's which was about 100 years ago and it definitely stopped adrenaline rushes and anxiety. A lot of people in the PTSD community use propranolol and say it works really well.

By the way, your adrenaline surges have a name -- they are called hypnic jerks. Or sometimes hypnagogic jerks. Or ""sleep starts"". They are awful and I hate them. Many, many things cause them. It's never just one thing."
10m0914,"Yeah, I tried that but the reduced dose doesn‚Äôt help me sleep. Thank you for your reply though!"
10m0914,Ask your psychiatrist about it
10m0914,"The dose I take to sleep is super low - sub therapeutic for depression therapy. I'm also on pristiq and Buspar for depression.     
Not pushing any agenda here, just letting you know what the options are. I know how awful not sleeping is."
10m0914,"Most doctors combine it with other antidepressants. Trazodone is not an SSRI. It's a SARI, which is a different class of antidepressants from stuff like Prozac, Zoloft, and other SSRI's etc. 

In fact it is so often paired with SSRI's because SSRI's cause horrible insomnia. üôÉ"
10m0914,Time to cut it in quarters :)
10m0914,I think that would be a good place to start. I also halved mine at first to see how it would effect me. 50 was my sweet spot :) Good luck!
10m0914,"Yes he mentioned beta blockers but said he wanted me to be able to follow up for cardio first , and beta blockers would just mask symptoms. üò© I‚Äôm just praying this trazodone helps for at the very least tonight. I‚Äôm so tired. Absolutely miserable right now tbh. My husband takes a beta blocker , metoprolol. I know it‚Äôs not advised but I‚Äôm so tempted to take one of his if this won‚Äôt stop."
10m0914,"I understand! That sucks. We will see how it works out for me. I have this awful feeling that I will be unlucky with it, too. It just seems to go that way with me and meds."
10m0914,"Not a bad idea. I'll give it a few tries with the 25, then move on to that if I don't adjust. 

Hopefully it cuts okay since it isn't scored for quarters."
10m0914,"If you do that, make sure to take your blood pressure first. If you have lower blood pressure like I do (90/65), don't take it. Ideally you'd want your bp at least in the triple digits for the top number. It could put you in hypotension if your top number is in the double digits like mine. A beta blocker would drop me easily into the 80/50 bp range which is dangerous.

Also, look up what range his dosage is in. Ideally, you'd want to try the lowest dosage first. If his dosage is too high, it could have a bad effect on you/make you sick/etc.

Ideally, however, I would just follow up with your doctor. If all of your cardio stuff checks out, then he'll probably script you the beta blockers. He is right that you don't want to mask a heart problem. Sometimes these symptoms are helpful in tracking something bigger than could be wrong. But I can't imagine he wouldn't give you the beta blockers after follow up unless you have super low bp like me."
10m0914,"I cut them with a razor blade on a kitchen cutting board. The razor blade always makes me look like a maniacal drug addict, but it's the best method I've found."
10m0914,"I have an appt with primary on Monday. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be given more blood work and a cardio referral. Been too scared to try the beta blocker , prob for the best lol. The trazodone was great for the first night- second night not much help at all. My heart does seem to feel better on it though which is weird. The first night I took it I had none of the strange heart racing and palpitations- second night just mildly. I also reinstated my lexapro at 5mg thinking maybe this is all just due to withdrawal and I‚Äôd rather be fat than feel this way lol"
10m0914,Lol. I DO have an official pill cutter. It needs replacing tho. Maybe I'll just do what you do. üëç

10hqdoa,I know right! It's a good symptoms to mention when someone belittles your experience to just being hot sometimes. One found that saying such a bizarre symptom helps people realise the extent of what can happen.

10zxdw5,"When I had terrible insomnia and didn‚Äôt know why after I‚Äôd been in peri for several years, I came across a cream called Progesto-life. I‚Äôd use it before bed and I slept like a log on it. I recommended it to friends. It helped one with hot flashes and another friend called called me an Angel sent from God because she hadnt slept in weeks till she tried it. I‚Äôd tried several rx sleep meds, melatonin, cool dark room, meditation, exercise; everything. People on here will tell you that otc creams like that are useless. I disagree. If something was going to have a placebo effect I gave my body a good dozen things to placebo me on. It was the cream. About a year later I started needed two squirts of the cream on my wrists before bed. About a year after that I got a progesterone rx from my doctor and never looked back. It‚Äôs certainly worth a try."
10zxdw5,"OTC medicine Sarna for itchiness.  THC for sleep.  I use 5mg THC 1 mg CBN gummies sometimes only 1/2 a gummy (you can also try antihistamines like benedryl for sleep if desperate, but they supposedly aren't healthy to use long term unlike THC which is probably harmless.  But it's possible the itchiness might also be a histamine reaction so the benedryl might be two birds with one stone).  

When hormones are really crashing THC may not be enough and you might eventually need hormones, but THC is an easy thing to try (at least where legal) and if it does the job it's a lot simpler than jumping on hormones ASAP which have their own side effects if you are still making some hormones still."
10zxdw5,">I saw my GYN who drew blood, told me I‚Äôm ‚Äúnowhere near menopause‚Äù and referred me back to my primary. That cost $350. There‚Äôs a hormone specialist in GYN office, but GYN indicated that she wouldn‚Äôt help me because of my lab levels. 

This is exactly why hormonal tests are completely useless.  They show what your hormones were doing **on that day** and nothing more. No reputable doctor would consider hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause.  It is a huge injustice as it gives doctors a reason to not pursue anything further, and only serves to make you feel like you're crazy for even suggesting you're peri/menopausal.  

We need to demand more from our health care providers! 


Consider the patches."
10zxdw5,"I‚Äôm sorry this is all so expensive for you + that you don‚Äôt have access to public healthcare. 

There must be something about your age, perhaps, that is locking access to HRT? I just walked into my doctor‚Äôs office and explained the hot flashes and insomnia had become unbearable, and I walked out with a prescription w/o any tests. As it should be, as standard HRT access is symptom-based. But I am 53 years old, so that may be the difference.  

There are suggestions in the wiki for alternatives that may help you (closer to the end of the wiki there are supplement suggestions): 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index

You can also ask your doctor for estrogen vaginal cream? It shouldn‚Äôt be as difficult to get as full HRT. 

I‚Äôve seen folks swear up and down about magnesium glycinate (or bisglycinate) to help with sleep."
10zxdw5,"Ok, so I had the super itchy labia too. Like maddening itchiness. I had raised skin like welts. Gyno ran tests and no infections. I went to a dermatologist and they did a biopsy and nothing there either. I was given clobetasol which helped only occasionally. Do you know what I discovered? That I‚Äôm now all of a sudden allergic to polyester! And everything has polyester in it! I switched to all cotton underwear and it made the itchiness stop! Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt find a bra without polyester so I‚Äôm still looking. I see an allergist next month who will test for fabric allergies so I can narrow it down, but yea. Polyester underwear, and guess what?? Even panty liners have polyester!! I was always wondering why the itchiness ramped up when I wore a pad! Well, that‚Äôs why!"
10zxdw5,"Ask for vaginal estrogen cream for the itching. I had it so bad I couldn't sleep. They should be able to give it to you regardless of your labs. I'm not suggesting that you fib, but perhaps add in painful intercourse to the discussion and see if you can get them to give it to you.

It took time to get it under control once I started using it so be patient. It's not an instant relief remedy but it will work."
10zxdw5,"This may be nothing. But recently I made homemade turkey soup.  Super traditional with roasted veggies and boiling the bones for hours.  The broth was freaking amazing.  (absolute jello the next morning) Lots of vegetables and garlic and onions and extra turkey.  The two nights we ate it I (and my husband who tends to wake up with me because im not happy about it) we slept all the way from about 10:30 to 6 AM. The day after that we ate something else. Dont remember what.  Bang. Up at 3:15.  Im thinking it was the bone broth that I don't usually have around.  Im seriously thinking about buying another small turkey to cook for soup.     If it isnt the turkey broth then Im not sure what it was.  We ate it with garlic bread (which we eat all the time). I woke feeling fantastic. (relatively) YMMV

ETA: vibrating bed? I love the idea of it. Like when my kids were babies and I put them on the washing machine/dryer to sleep.   Hmmmmmm"
10zxdw5,"Awesome, Ty!"
10zxdw5,Thanks!!
10zxdw5,"That‚Äôs interesting! I only wear cotton underwear for the plastic 10+ years, but dang what a thing to go through! I‚Äôve had sorta similar stuff happen in life- Broke out in crazy itchy hives after going on runs for years after I gave birth. Drs were useless but I assumed hormones were at okay somehow since it distinctly started after giving birth. A few years ago I became allergic to anything that touched my lips; anything. Chapstick, lipgloss, Vaseline‚Ä¶ anything. I also have tattoos that break out in itchy hives occasionally where there is blue ink. I don‚Äôt know enough about skin as an organ and allergic reactions to understand all of this but that‚Äôs a good reminder to consider what else can be at play sometimes. Thanks!"
10zxdw5,Ty!
10zxdw5,"Strangely enough, my itchiness started after giving birth as well. It was hard to nail down because the itchiness was located on the labia only. In the past year, I started breaking out in an itchy rash on my torso, lower back and underneath my breasts. And only really recently (the last month) did I realize it was polyester. Again, I‚Äôm going to see an allergist next month but, yes. It‚Äôs been a wild ride."
10zxdw5,Glad you found the cause! It‚Äôs amazing what we can randomly become allergic to!
10ubyz7,Doesn't matter. You can still go on HRT. Clearly you are in very late stage peri.
10ubyz7,Definitely stay on course with your HRT plans. I wish I had started it when I was at your stage.
10ubyz7,Got to love how our bodies work and the ‚Äúgames‚Äù they like to play.
10ubyz7,Glad you‚Äôre finally getting some help. Give it a couple of months and let us know how you‚Äôre feeling. Best of luck to you
10ubyz7,"No worries about bleeding and HRT‚Ä¶ my periods are regular and I‚Äôm on it, so you don‚Äôt have to be done bleeding for it.

And if amount gets to be too much and goes on a long time, you can ask for another pill to lessen or stop the bleeding. Some women also get ablations, which can also help.

I‚Äôm hopeful for you that the recent seven month break means that whenever you do get the floodgates under control, you‚Äôll go even longer without a period next time.ü§ûüèº"
10ubyz7,"I'm in very early stage peri, still with regularish periods (a bit erratic, but no missing months) and have started HRT to deal with PMDD. It's amazing, I wouldn't let having a period delay starting."
10ubyz7,Welcome to the jungle.  Fibroids add a very special dynamic to this BS.  Fibrositic breast are fun too. I am still jacking around with progesterone levels since getting the E patch at the right dose. When I bleed it is for like 10-12 days. Takes extra progesterone to make it stop. And I just learned vaginally is way more effective.  A smaller has more direct impact.  It did stop a 12 day period FINALLY!  Hang tough. Glad you found us. Great support here.
10ubyz7,"I have been on hrt for 3 years and still get a random period (usually when my daughter has hers). If I forget to take my hrt pills in the morning, I will spot for a few days"
10ubyz7,"I'm almost 41 and peri started about 5 months ago. Pretty much same as you with the periods still. I have hot flashes all day, not constant, but you know. Insomnia has started. Mood problems just started. Uncontrollable crying a couple of days ago and I find it odd because I never cry. My mom was done with peri at 40. My older sister was done at 42. My periods just started to get wonky, coming late, early, heavy, light, 7 days to only 4 days. Anyway, my doctor won't test me. I'm wondering if hrt may help me soon. I also have cervical dystonia and chronic migraine. Is hrt alright to take with migraine? Sorry to totally hijack this."
10ubyz7,"I spoke to a menopause specialist in the UK who was more than happy to prescribe HRT for me. There are no blood tests as, especially in perimenopause, hormone levels are in constant flux, they could be different hours apart. She went by symptoms alone. Your best bet is to find a specialist and talk to them. I recommend looking at the balance website and app balance-menopause.com They have a lot of resources and information"
10hfmo9,"Thank you for your post. Your words really resonated with me. I'm also beginning to feel that it does get better. 

I'm 56, and it has been one year and two weeks since my last period--official menopause!"
10hfmo9,"Thank you for your post and perspective. I can‚Äôt take hrt due to a blood issue. I wonder daily when this hell will end, if ever. I‚Äôm 3 yrs into this exhausted and feel like a shell of a human!"
10hfmo9,"I am glad it got better ***for you.***

I'm almost 10 years post-surgical menopause, and it's not even close to better for me. I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. I am terrified that this is it for the rest of my life. Although your words are encouraging, they just don't resonate with me. 

My Mother had menopausal symptoms into her 80s. It happens. The GYN says maybe that's what I'm in for and shrugs her shoulders. My GP offers me more antidepressants.

My daughter, 22 knows everything, I would never consider leaving her out in the cold not knowing that this is a possibility in her future, to me that is like withholding crucial medical information. I love her and I want her to be prepared, just in case she follows in her grandmother and my footsteps.

So I'm glad you are over it, it's good to know it does happen for some people. üòÄ"

10hfmo9,"I'm preaching the horrors to anyone that will listen, including my two grown daughters. I'm embarrassed it took me so long to figure out what was going on. Once I figured it out, it took me a little while to research remediation. I don't want my girls or ANY person to go through that without knowing there are options. Whatever path you choose -cool- just know it doesn't have to be the suffer in silence route."
10hfmo9,I'm 64 and it's only slightly better
10hfmo9,"Thank you for your perspective and giving hope that things will be better when we get to ‚Äúthe other side.‚Äù I still have a healthy respect for each individual woman‚Äôs experience with their own journey and what they feel they can and cannot tolerate. And no woman should be forced to suck it up and ‚Äúwait for things to get better.‚Äù For some women the side effects of hormonal loss is just too great, and the option to pursue and access HRT is necessary. There is no shame in doing so. I also understand your rationale for not telling your daughters about what is to come, but that is your perspective. I have three daughters and hell yes they know everything I am going through as it happens, and what I am doing about it. As a mother I feel it is my job to empower my children in any way I can. My mom did not do this for me, and she was a highly educated medical professional. Am I bitter about that? In some ways, but I also believe it was a generational thing, and for her she just assumed she had to suck it up. I want my girls to know what to expect and what their options are to help themselves, and they will have each other for support as they transition.  The next generation always seems to be harder than the previous one, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I am going to cripple my daughters by denying them crucial information about an unavoidable health challenge which will most likely effect every aspect of their lives. I love them too dearly to know I could have said something to ease their pain‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt."
10hfmo9,It got better...for you.  It doesn't for everyone.  My grandmother had horrible hot flashes until she died in her 80s; my mother never had any.  It's highly individual.
10hfmo9,"Reverse puberty my ass! One gets a period and wha-bam cramps and bleeding on a cycle.  The organs stop making cyclic hormones on a schedule; brain fog, vertigo, libido up down, all around, joint stiffness, atrophy of hormone sensitive parts, hot flashes, night sweats, hair fall. This, for 10+ years is not puberty onset."
10hfmo9,Im so happy for you. Did you take HRT?
10hfmo9,I really appreciate your post; I do wish my aunt an others would have been able to speak more about mood co tell though; it would have saved me so much chaotic behavior just knowing that the emotional roller coaster was real and not perceived and I‚Äôd have been on a mood stabilizer much sooner.
10hfmo9,I don't want to be disinterested in sex. I'm just figuring out what I want.
10hfmo9,I‚Äôm crying today cos I put on weight again. I don‚Äôt see how it goes better

10hfmo9,True. But this sub has a lot of people who are suffering and my intent was to give hope.
10hfmo9,"At the very beginning of peri when hot flashes were driving me mad, a fellow nurse told me about how she titrated progesterone-only pills. My doc (whose wife was also going through peri thought it was a great idea so he agreed).

I don't have any desire to chop wood or even snow blow the 1/4 mile (ish) driveway. I dream of selling my novel, and a cookbook, and maybe watercolor/ photography prints to pay someone to do those things. Spent the better part of the last 30 years living frugally and pinching pennies, so I want to live out my days NOT having to do that. Of course, there's something to be said for opening mason jars of food from your own garden, and freezers (yes, plural) of meat and produce of your own. Strawberry shortcake in January? Beet greens in February? Relish and chow and pickles? Pork and chicken and turkey? And EGGS.  Jars of dried herbs.

10uj64t,"As someone who grew up in rural Montana, I do NOT wish to return to that lifestyle. I had to split wood during the hot summers so we could stay warm in the winter. Want it to be above freezing in the house when you get up in the morning, get up in the middle of the night to put wood on the fire. We had to shoot deer, elk, and grouse for food, field dress that animal, butcher it. I don't miss that at all. Not one teeny bit! Scared of noises in the night? Probably a large mammal (bear, mountain lion, deer) walking around. Your giant dog will bark, his hair will stand on end, and you'll pee yourself a little.

Shoveling snow off your walkway is one thing, but plowing your driveway is a whole new level of pain in the ass. Want cows, chickens, horses, or other animals that live outside? Keeping them watered in the winter is a daily chore. 

All that said, I do pick my own produce from nearby farms, put up canned fruit, jam, pickles, and salsa that line the shelves of my garage. I grow veggies. And I spend a lot of time in the woods. But I buy my meats at the butcher or grocery store. And my home is not heated with wood I have to spend all summer splitting.

If it will not be a cottage, maybe it will be living closer to the nature. I am already growing some plants on my windowsill. Maybe I will have some holidays in a cottage first and try it out.

10uj64t,"Well, my version isn't exactly like this. I'm married and hope to live out old age with my husband. However, should something happen to our marriage or to him, I would hope to age and live in some sort of situation where I could live independently in small homes, but they would be clustered close to like-minded women so we could help to support and hang out with one another. I am a dog lover, but of smaller dogs, unfortunately I'm allergic to cats otherwise I'd have them. And for me, I love the mountains, but love the beach even more."

10uj64t,"I want to start a non religious compound of crones. Keep a garden, keep some animals, share good food from the garden, have little cabins scattered all over the compound so everyone can get away if they want to. 

Being older would be scary to be totally alone, but the zero F life? Yeah I can get behind that now. My 20 year old self would not understand."
10uj64t,"I'm an urban crone. Never took to country life, can't tend a garden without getting massively heat-sick. So I will just stay here in my small house with the husband and two dogs. Put witchy-looking poppets in the windows to make missionaries avoid me."
10uj64t,I‚Äôm DOWN! Where do I sign up?!
10uj64t,"That sounds amazing, I'm ready to move there now."
10uj64t,"OMG, I love you. I already live in the mountains and go to town maybe 4 times a year and have 6 dogs and 1 gecko. Chickens in the spring and goats. I'm 47 and stoked about living the crone life. Everyone can just fuck off, lol."
10uj64t,"I‚Äôve had this dream for a good 30 years and I just hit 50. I‚Äôd add , in my version, I write novels on an old typewriter and tinker on restoring old cars between chapters. But yes on the cats, dog and chickens. Should be an old lake nearby for fishing, too. I‚Äôm seriously contemplating how to make this my reality in the next year!"
10uj64t,"I feel totally empowered by these words: Witch, Crone, Hag. They feel like magic words to me and something to aspire to, names you have to earn. Like, I am not quite there yet, but that‚Äôs exactly where I‚Äôm heading, and if I‚Äôm fortunate, I will get there. It‚Äôs a privilege to get old. For those that relate, I recommend this book: Hagitude by Sharon Blackie."
10uj64t,"Except for the big scary dog, I‚Äôm right there in my feelings. How long is this going to last????!!!!!!!"
10uj64t,"Absolutely! After I had my hysterectomy last summer, I dyed my hair dark green to celebrate my transition into bog witch. I see myself as a very self-sufficient crone, and imagine a big garden and a bunch of foxes that I can dote on."
10uj64t,"I'm mean, I don't live alone. But I do live in the country on 15 acres with pigs, chickens, turkeys, guineas, ducks, geese, barn cats and 4 big ass dogs. My husband and I both grew up out here, lived in the city for work. Ww both got sick of the city and we can both work remote so we moved back home a year ago and bought some land."
10uj64t,"The word ""crone"" really sucks because it LITERALLY means ""ugly old woman."" First, I am 50 -- I am not ugly, nor am I elderly. I am not a crone. I don't want to be called a crone by anyone, including other women. In all sincerity -- fuck that. Can we please come up with a better word and leave ""crone"" and ""witch"" and all that stupid shit far behind, please?"

10uj64t,"Solidarity.  

I'm entering Peri and my 700 sq feet of Raised French Intensive, Permaculture orchard, sunken beds, and the whole birds and bees and goat -laden suburban farm is... a bit much.  Once I took a year off from gardening to recover from, um, stuff, and found buying produce to be weird as hell.  Easier, sure, but weird, not something I want to expose myself to again.  Grocery stores just don't have any choices, and they're so expensive.  And yet I know I don't want all this work wearing on me for very much longer.  I mean... along with foxes, raccoons, coyotes, waves of rats, and opossums, we get mountain lions every year.  Freakin' PUMA. 

And now I'm seeing these YouTube videos of people expecting praise because they're cooking from scratch.  Apparently ""from scratch"" is browning meat and pouring in pre-made marinara sauce?  Then there are arguments on whether it's ""worth it"" to peel and chop your own onions?  For goodness' sake.  

I have four different landraces of onion, one is specifically just for the boar we shoot in the hills and put up.  They are delicious and take up a lot of Greensand, they get 120 sq ft every year not counting cold storage.  It's great eating but man is it a lot of work.  I just processed, browned, and put up 4 lbs of garlic, 20 lbs of ground deer, 11 lbs of onion... then made dinner for goodness' sake.  Dinner was less than a dollar a plate, from scratch, organic, and my feet are throbbing. 

Those idiots looking for Wisdom better show up with a fresh loaf of bread and chocolate.  And maybe some weed.  And painkillers.

10uj64t,"Lol, that‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm patiently waiting for my hair to turn stark white. It‚Äôs going to be so freaking fun."
10uj64t,"Personally, I would rather take back these words, but to each their own. :)"
10uj64t,"""Crone"" and ""witch"" are meant to scare people by insecure men so that they don't realize that women aren't worthless beyond being walking vaginas. Women doing their own thing is a threat to fools, and have been stigmatized for it, if not literally killed.

I've never seen such an extreme reaction to something that no one is demanding that everyone participate in. Don't be a crone; no one's gonna come to your house and give you a demerit on your permanent record.

I personally don't refer to myself as a crone but I don't see any point in yucking someone else's yum when no harm is being done. Go do your own thing, and show the same grace to others."
10uj64t,"That may be the dictionary definition, but consider the spiritual meaning:

The crone archetypal image represents wisdom and inner ways of knowing, guidance through transitions of the life cycle that are also represented in nature, and the transformation."
10uj64t,"The way words are used changes over time. Crone can be used to mean an ugly old woman but many people use it to mean simply an older woman and that definition is just as valid to those who are reclaiming the term. Society may have put ugly with old because our skin, hair, and bodies change during and following the menopause transition. We can choose not to internalize and accept those views and reclaim words like hag, crone, witch, etc. Many women now view crone as simply another phase of life that follows the maiden and mother phases. Again, those don‚Äôt have to be literal either. Your feeling about that word are valid for you but arguing with others who feel differently because you think your view is the one true view past the patriarchy and cis heteronormative society is condescending and unnecessary."
10uj64t,"I love the different perspectives here. I am embracing referring to myself as a witch (spirituality practices being part of that admittedly). In my personal language, witch and crone are compliments.  I'm sorry that's such a hot point for you, but no judgment."
10uj64t,"‚ÄúWitch‚Äù is not a negative term. It was made so by the patriarchy to dehumanize, vilify, and discredit women who had extensive knowledge in herbalism, birthing babies, and general healing. I view the word crone as the same. As someone else said, don‚Äôt yuck someone‚Äôs yum. No one is suggesting you become what you consider yo be ugly."
10uj64t,"The crone is part of the triple goddess. Maiden, Mother and Crone. The Crone is the wise elder. I'm going to do a Pagan garden blessing ceremony with my daughters and granddaughters. Granddaughters will be the maidens, daughters will be the mothers and I will be the crone."
10uj64t,I hear you.üíú I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm able to ‚Äúre-claim‚Äù crone for myself at the moment but I don‚Äôt mind hearing about others doing it who find it positive.

10uj64t,I'm not either-- 5' and 180 lbs. And the puppy thinks he's a lap dog ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10uj64t,"A few weeks ago there was a raccoon chilling in a nesting box ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... No birds were attacked but one died a couple days later of (possibly) PTSD after my husband shot the bugger 2 spaces over from her. That makes 4 raccoons this year, 2 groundhogs, and 4 or 5 skunks. I think. No pumas here, but we hear the coyotes. And fences were damaged last summer by moose, after which the cows went for almost daily walks down the road, until they all got fixed. The garden would've been amazing had I braved the blackflies long enough to keep up on the weeding. We sold half our half-grown meat birds when it looked like we weren't getting a date at the abbatoir and would have to process ourselves, only to have them email a week later that they had a cancellation. 

I'm with you on the weirdness of grocery shopping. In our last place, where we'd worked the garden long enough to be able to turn it with a spoon, and had raised beds and loads of perennials, we had amazing produce. Loads of it. Here we're almost starting from scratch, and fighting not just the blackflies but thistle and burdock. It's exhausting. And the result last summer was pitiful by past experience. If I can get some energy back and have less joint pain, hopefully this summer will be better. We have snow until mid-April, at least, so a lot has to be started inside."

10uj64t,"So let's reclaim it then, the same way that many people reclaim words that were used with negative connotations previously.

Language is fluid and ever changing."
10uj64t,"Language can be [prescriptive (you let the rules influence how you use language) or it can be descriptive](https://osuwritingcenter.okstate.edu/blog/2020/10/30/prescriptive-and-descriptive-grammar) (it reflects how things are actually used).  I prefer descriptive, because I don't allow others to tell me how I talk, how I write, how I think.  The history of our language shows that old women were revered.   I want that back.  I will bring it back, in my life at least.

10uj64t,"Hilarious that people are downvoting actual dictionary definitions, LOL. Damn. That is bizarre."
10uj64t,"Thanks for your input. I wasn't talking about the dictionary definition, I'm talking archetypes. 

archetype, (from Greek archetypos, ‚Äúoriginal pattern‚Äù), in literary criticism, a primordial image, character, or pattern of circumstances that recurs throughout literature and thought consistently enough to be considered a universal concept or situation.

You seem to be hell bent on making people accept this definition. Personally I'm happy with being a crone and I'm not ugly."
10uj64t,"And to put in further context -- I had bad acne in my 20s. I used to walk around hiding my face behind a curtain of hair. Whatever that youthful beauty is all of you seem to obsess about -- I didn't have it. It took me years to get some level of confidence about my appearance after that. And now that I'm 50 and looking fantastic compared to how I did back then, I am not about to just accept that I'm now ugly. What in the actual F. No. I'm better than ever, and it's OK to still want to look good (again, this has nothing to do with men, whom I never much gave a shit about, and everything to do with myself). So, no, I'm not embracing crone when I'm actually not one in the slightest. And that whole line of thinking is baffling to me."
10uj64t,"No reason to ""take back"" a word that was never a good one to begin with. Crone is an ugly word referring to an ugly, unpleasant old woman. Can we please just fuck off with all that? Men don't start calling themselves old and ugly at fucking 50 years old. Enough. I'm not fucking ugly. Not even close. I look better than I did at 25. Enough of this shit."
10uj64t,"_crone (n.)
late 14c., ""a feeble and withered old woman,"" in Middle English a strong term of abuse, from Anglo-French carogne ""carrion, carcass; an old ewe,"" also a term of abuse, from Old North French carogne, Old French charogne, term of abuse for a cantankerous or withered woman, also ""old sheep,"" literally ""carrion,"" from Vulgar Latin *caronia (see carrion)._

_Perhaps the ""old ewe"" sense is older than the ""old woman"" one in French, but the former is attested in English only from 16c. Since mid-20c. the word has been somewhat reclaimed in feminism and neo-paganism as a symbol of mature female wisdom and power._"
10uj64t,"I hear you, but I'm not at all a fan of ""maiden"" or ""mother"" either. I was never either one of those things, lol.

I just feel like women do this shit but men absolutely do not, at least not in the same way. There is something sexist and self-hating about it, even as it tries to be something different."
10uj64t,"I'm OK with ""witch."" But there is nothing positive or empowering about ""crone."""
10uj64t,"I'm not a wise elder, lol. Not yet. Long time from now, perhaps. But ""wise"" may never really come. I think one of the main lessons of life, really, is that no one ever really knows shit. And then we die.

It's almost comforting."
10uj64t,yesssss sister!
10uj64t,it's incredibly freeing!
10uj64t,"Getting older does not mean getting ugly. Older women are beautiful, too. You actually sound like you are buying into the patriarchal bullshit about women ""losing their looks,"" etc. This isn't true. You can still be beautiful to yourself and others without it being about sex. Damn. Women are SO fucked up by our society. It's so sad to see."

10uj64t,"Moose?  Moose!!!  And snow?????  Thank you, I feel better.   I'll send some of our nice weather your way when we get it. 

April snow, what the heck!"
10uj64t,"I don't want to reclaim it. It's an ugly word, and I don't like it. You do what you want."
10uj64t,"I'd be happy to see it, BTW. I just can't recall it ever being used that way."
10uj64t,"OK, point me to just one example in any form of literature in which the word is used in a POSITIVE way and the woman depicted is not ugly/withered/hag-like."
10uj64t,"You don't have to embrace it if you don't want to. Our generation is redefining and raising awareness of this phase of life. If if others want to reclaim ""crone"" they can certainly do that. You can call yourself something else I'm sure others that agree with you will probably adopt it.

Nobody's calling you a crone. You can always correct them."
10uj64t,"I don't think anyone here actually considers themselves ugly??  For me, I used to get down about losing my youthful appearance. Now I've come to realize I'm still wildly attractive -- perhaps even more so than in my 30s and
I'm also confident and secure enough to dress how I prefer and go without makeup, hair done, etc. 

I think that's more the mindset here. Not, ""I'm ugly now but that's ok.""  More like, ""goddamn am I fucking awesome and beautiful and strong and the hell with anyone who doesn't like something about me."""
10uj64t,Why downvoted? Is it bad that I don't want to call myself ugly now that I'm 50? Are all the crones disapproving? What is even going on with women that they would downvote that??
10uj64t,I agree with you that that word is not one that I identify with or want to identify with.
10uj64t,There isn‚Äôt anything sexist of self hating in these terms. You are projecting that. It isn‚Äôt trying to be different. It is acknowledging the way society had viewed women at all points in their lives. Men may not use these types of terms but it doesn‚Äôt make them some kind of insult or demeaning thing for women to. We do go through very clear life changes when we begin having a menstrual cycle and again when that cycle ceases. Those of us who use these terms aren‚Äôt at all self hating.  This idea that by rejecting these terms that you are more enlightened and have escaped internalized bullshit is ridiculous. It just means that the term doesn‚Äôt have value to you. You do not speak for others and your holier than thou attitude towards other women who do find value in reclaiming these terms makes that clear.
10uj64t,"To YOU.

Please stop pissing all over what many others are embracing and reclaiming *happily*, with literally zero thoughts toward pleasing men/the patriarchy/the shitty standards of the beauty industry."
10uj64t,"How do you get there? I mean, I'm there on the outside, but having trouble with it in my head."
10uj64t,"this is all true (i think everyone is beautiful in their own way) but it's also ok to not be, or worry about, being beautiful and to just be a person. 'Prettiness is not a rent you pay for occupying a space marked ‚Äúfemale‚Äù' and all that

10uj64t,"Oh for fucks sake, read what I actually wrote with good faith, not what you expect to see."
10uj64t,"I had an unsupportive experience, and felt very let down by the community there."
10uj64t,"Thank you, I was sorry too as I had really felt part of the community there."
10uj64t,"I had an unsupportive experience there, and felt very let down by the community."
10uj64t,"So, the dictionary is one perspective, and your opinion is valid. If that word triggers you, by all means, don't use it. 

Perhaps it would comfort you to know that the word ""crone"" has other uses. Pagan traditions with the triple goddess refer to the [Maiden, the Mother and the Crone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)) They specifically define [""Crone"" as ""Wise Woman,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crone) losing the negative connotations. As a matter of fact, 

> Clarissa Pinkola Estes suggests that the word crone may derive from the word crown (or, la corona). While a crown is known as a circlet that goes around the head and establishes one‚Äôs authority as a leader, ""before this understanding, the crown, la corona, was understood to mean the halo of light around a person‚Äôs body. La corona was considered to shine more brightly when a person was clear, filled with love and justice.""[4] Thus, Estes suggests, the Crone is one who reflects this enhanced degree of clarity and in/sight.

Kinda cool imo. 

I'm sad that our dictionary friends don't mention the idea of wise woman as part of the definition. 

Hope this helps. And if you still find it ugly, that's cool too. We should all define ourselves as we wish."
10uj64t,"There is a large body of literature by feminist scholars, archeologists, theologians, etc., particularly those who are interested in the concept of the Great Goddess, who use the word ‚Äúcrone‚Äù in a positive and markedly feminist way. See, e.g., the work of Marija Gimbutas or Carol P. Christ. These are not your choosy-choice third wave feminists who claim that anything that feels good is ‚Äúempowering,‚Äù either. This is a movement rooted in the radical feminism of the 60s and 70s that continues today. 

The [triple goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_(Neopaganism)?wprov=sfti1) is a concept that is present is a number of modern pagan and/or Wiccan traditions, especially those with a strong feminist component. The maiden, the mother, and the crone are archetypes that describe the different phases of a woman‚Äôs life. These terms are not meant literally - for example, the mother phase does not mean one must literally have children, nor does it refer to the type of self-sacrificing caretaking role so glorified in our patriarchal culture. Rather, in this case, the idea of the mother references creative power, the ability to create and bring forth. This could mean babies, but it could also mean art or literature or scientific knowledge or anything else that a woman in the middle part of her life might bring forth in her own rich and powerful creativity. The maiden is a young woman awakening to the world, growing, gaining confidence, her life ahead of her. The crone is a woman in the last third of her life, rich with wisdom and experience, looked up to and respected for her deep knowledge and understanding. 

None of these have anything to do with patriarchal standards of beauty. These phases are about our internal experience and about our role in our communities. 

Etymologically speaking, ‚Äúcrone‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really mean ‚Äúugly,‚Äù though it did originate in the Middle Ages as a term for a woman, especially an older one, who was considered disagreeable or cantankerous - in other words, a woman with an opinion and the confidence to value her own knowledge and to dare to share it out loud! That‚Äôs the reason so many feminists have embraced this term, because we refuse to sit down and shut up, to make ourselves small, in the face of patriarchal violence and silencing. 

There are words that have undergone various types of feminist reclamation that just don‚Äôt resonate with me. I have never liked ‚Äúslut,‚Äù for example - I identify more with Take Back the Night than I do with Slutwalk. And as a lesbian, I‚Äôm not a fan of the term ‚Äúqueer‚Äù - I‚Äôm too old, and it still sounds too much like an insult to me, though I‚Äôve accepted that the younger generation seems to have fully embraced it and it‚Äôs not going anywhere. 

But ‚Äúcrone‚Äù? Goddess, yes. The wisdom and knowledge behind that reverent title is hard-earned, and you‚Äôd better believe I‚Äôll embrace it fully when my turn comes (I‚Äôm currently in my 40s, in peri, and haven‚Äôt quite yet arrived on the doorstep of cronehood). 

Btw, in my (pagan) spiritual community, there is a ceremony to honor and celebrate women when they officially become crones, or wise women, and it‚Äôs wonderful. 

You certainly don‚Äôt have to identify or agree with any of the above, but it seems like it might be valuable for you to understand the history of these terms with regards to feminist movements and pagan religions a bit more, as your idea that women embracing ‚Äúcrone‚Äù are simply dupes of patriarchy is ahistorical and just couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Peace to you, whatever terms you choose for yourself."
10uj64t,Are you okay? Like seriously? I don't have the time nor the energy to debate you on this. Have the day you deserve x
10uj64t,"But what it sounds like our generation is doing is bowing under the patriarchal idea that women are ugly as they age. This is not empowering. It's ""fake"" empowering. It is still viewing yourselves in the eyes of mainstream society and heterosexual men. It is not freeing or cool or anything but self-hatred dressed up in ""empowerment."""
10uj64t,"For real I‚Äôm actually not very pretty anymore in any conventional way and that‚Äôs totally fine. 

Lots of people were never thin or pretty or hot or attractive to men to begin with.  So they have known all along that brains and personalities have absolutely been. enough to fetch good friends and jobs and husbands and it doesn‚Äôt make our kids love or hate us less or more. 

For lots of us, we don‚Äôt WANT the attention or the upkeep anymore.  We want freedom and space and time to string two coherent thoughts together and cook up some potions.  We want to eat the cake and stop shaving so goddamn much.  We want comfortable clothes that aren‚Äôt digging in and shoes that don‚Äôt hurt our feet.  Tired of blow drying and curling and dying hair.  

I wear what‚Äôs comfortable and practical and I take care of myself.  But I am in no way any conventional form of attractive anymore.   

Am I an old crone?  Probably.  Definitely a budding old hippie.   But I am what I am I don‚Äôt need to further define or label it or get offended by people I don‚Äôt even know."
10uj64t,"Women on here are fully saying, ""I want to be ugly."" The definition of the word crone is LITERALLY ""ugly/unpleasant old woman."" It's a harsh, ugly word that I don't think applies simply because we are no longer 25. 

And fuck yes I look MUCH better at 50 than I did at 25. No contest. I did not have ""youthful beauty."" This sub seems obsessed with the concept of that, though, and the idea that it ""fades"" instead of simply ""changes."" 

I was kind of an uggo at 25, quite honestly, lol. If we're being real. I had acne and greasy hair and was awkward and uncomfortable all the time. I'm smoking at 50 compared to that shit. And again, it's not about men at all. Who the fuck cares about men? It's about feeling good and beautiful and strong, instead of like some kind of fucking ""crone.""

I dunno. I could be overreacting for sure, but -- eh."
10uj64t,"You‚Äôre pushing your way of looking at this on others, if you don‚Äôt like the word being used, cool, that‚Äôs your right. If some of us are okay with the word, cool, that‚Äôs our right. Empowerment can look different for different people."
10uj64t,"I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I think they might feel judged by what you‚Äôve said. They feel empowered using certain words, and you called it bullshit. If it were me, yeah, I would feel offended. Hey, I mean, I am not in a positive enough frame of mind (yet) to call myself a crone, but i am fine with people reclaiming it. In fact, I think that‚Äôs a good idea. Too many awful gendered words out there. Consider, for example, ‚Äúslut.‚Äù That one I was and am
very happy to reclaim. ü§£"
10uj64t,"I think this is a false ""empowering"" idea that actually still bends DEEPLY to the idea of what beauty means for a woman. It's a very cis het male way of looking at things, even if they think it is the opposite. Women our age are so fucked up, still, about all this stuff."
10uj64t,Men/the patriarchy/the beauty industry have zero to do with actual beauty. Absolutely nothing.
10uj64t,"without making this too much of a wall of text, a couple of years ago while pondering how dramatic some of my changes have been, it dawned on me that instead of being what i was and trying to do everything and please everyone, i am now one of the wizards and get to pick and choose what i spend my energy on because it is so very concentrated. and special, because i have done so so much. instead of holding myself against what i was x years ago, i have instead finally become one of the people i used to look up to and wonder about. and i can breathe into that and allow myself to take up a different kind of space. 

i can also be invisible whenever i want to be, which gives almost unimaginable freedom after 33 years of being followed, threatened, and sometimes assaulted wherever i went in public. if i want to show up i can, but if i don't want to...poof. 

i have so much more control over some things that really matter to me. and that feels amazing.

semirelatedly i'm nonbinary and can present a lot of different ways, which gives me unique challenges and also makes me invisible in spaces like this a lot of the time, so i'm trying to speak up a little more about it; going through this younger than i expected and completely alone in it both personally and culturally has been intense. we all have our unique challenges and talents. i hope that my presence will make room for more people like me, whenever i choose to open it up a bit---i'm sure that yours will for people who are like you, and have special talents like yours.

we're now guardians of certain kinds of things for the coming generations, and they're gonna need us. we can tell them about the superpowers when they get here.

you are a wizard with magic powers. when one thing leaves, another arrives to take its place. i believe in you.

also, p.s., hitachi magic wand and blowing your personal style up to 1000% ftw. what's good is good; what doesn't suit anymore can sail out the door"
10uj64t,"I don't agree with this. It's still all in the context of men and sexuality. Men don't talk this way about themselves. Why do we have to? I don't want to look good for anyone other than myself. Nothing wrong with that whatsoever, and honestly, the ""You don't have to be pretty"" shit is so condescending. Who the fuck says I have to do anything?"
10uj64t,"First, I think you are full of shit about feeling this way since ""3 or 4."" Second, again, you aren't ugly. Ugly is an ugly word. Only women do this to themselves. It's just sad, I'm sorry."
10uj64t,"r/SASSwitches and r/atheopaganism may be good alternatives to try. SASS is ""skeptical and science-seeking"" and atheopaganism follows a similar vein. More in the realm of using pagan ideology, iconography, and ritual as self-help tools. Hope you find it useful! üíú"
10uj64t,"I've only lurked there, because they seem kind of ... combative."
10uj64t,Bleah. I hate it when that happens.
10uj64t,"Thank you, I felt that way too"
10uj64t,üíô
10uj64t,"Better explanation than any other here. But the etymology of crone, tracing back to the 14th century, is indeed very negative. It derives from cariogne/carrion (i.e., the dead and rotting flesh of an animal). Withered flesh is the imagery and quite literally what it means, historically.

I am 50 and not remotely in crone stage, even in the more positive definitions of the term. I am not rich with wisdom and experience. I am still living and creating. Maybe I can slip into that stage at 70 or 80, although I doubt I will know jack shit by then either. But that isn't remotely what I identify with now. I'm not elderly. I don't know the secrets of the universe, and no one is looking to me to impart wisdom, lol. Just fuck all that. I am living my life the same as I  ever have, only I'm just that much closer to death (fine with me -- I am very death positive). I don't need to slip into this new ""category."" And  I'm never going to like that word. 

But thanks for this much better explanation than any other on this thread."
10uj64t,"I mean, Shakespeare's witches/crones? You could say they had power and were elevated in the stories to some degree. But all were hideously ugly as well."
10uj64t,"Guess that's my answer. I asked you to point me to an example, not to debate. You do not have one, clearly. You spouted all of these words about literary criticism and gave me absolutely nothing when I asked a very simple question -- point me to an example in which ""crone"" is used in literature in a positive manner. Do you have one?"
10uj64t,"If we find it empowering, then it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfake‚Äù empowerment. Not everyone has to feel the same way about everything. You are welcome to your opinions and we witches are too. Go lurk on r/witchesvspatriarchy if you‚Äôre confused about us."
10uj64t,"Nobody here said we are ugly as we age. It‚Äôs more about embracing being ourselves and doing what we want or don‚Äôt want as far as how we appear to society. Just because I choose not to dye my hair, wear makeup or dress in whatever the latest style is doesn‚Äôt mean I think I‚Äôm ugly, it means I don‚Äôt give a shit what anyone else thinks anymore and I‚Äôm doing what makes me happy."
10uj64t,"I'm not getting that impression from anyone here. I've seen many a poster comment that share your view but the people that want to embrace it have their own reasons whether it's to lighten the experience or empower themselves.

People feel powerful in different ways. If they're not using it to expressly harm themselves it's a non-issue here. Your opinion seems political the more you explain it."
10uj64t,">Women on here are fully saying, ""I want to be ugly."" 

I think you obviously feel very strongly about this, and that's fine.  But at the same time, I don't see anyone literally saying they want to be ugly."
10uj64t,"It‚Äôs not for you to decide what is empowering to other women. 

Yes, you dislike the word crone and that‚Äôs fine. But if other women are happy to use that word to describe themselves, that‚Äôs also fine. 

Stop gatekeeping."
10uj64t,"Yeah. I think embracing that we are ""ugly"" because we are not the age to reproduce is bullshit. We can be beautiful in other ways than being nubile."
10uj64t,"You have repeatedly gone on about how those who are ok with the title crone are actually ""bowing down to the patriarchy"" blah blah bloody blah. 

I don't know what crawled up your ass, but jfc can you just allow your fellow women embrace aging *however the hell they want to*?

Nobody is demanding that we all start handing out poisoned apples, walking with a hunched back and growing warts, yet you are militantly  berating anyone who is using the terms *they find acceptable for themselves*, as if they are a bunch of unruly and unintelligent teenagers.

Just take a breath already."
10uj64t,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, they resonated with me."
10uj64t,"i don't think it's condescending myself, and lots of us have little to nothing to do with cis men, but you certainly have the right to your feelings and i'm not going to fight about it. i just wanted to offer up why some of us feel the way we do. there's room for all of us in the world."
10uj64t,"I really don‚Äôt think anyone is saying that to you, but it does *sound* as if you‚Äôre saying that to them. this was 3 hours ago so I hope you‚Äôre ok now. I don‚Äôt mean that to sound condescending, if it does."
10uj64t,"Newsflash: not everything is about you. *I* want to be ugly. I do not want to engage in the fucking beauty industry. You can do whatever you want, if it gives you some scrap of self esteem to do so, but fucking consider shutting your flapping cakehole about telling other women who they ought to be and what they ought to feel, k?"
10uj64t,"Thank you for the pointers, will check those out. Much appreciated."

10uj64t,I sadly concur.
10uj64t,"Sigh. Yes, especially when least expected."
10uj64t,I'm sorry you experienced the same.
10uj64t,I guess I‚Äôm just curious why this is such a big deal to you?  It appears you feel really strongly on this topic.
10uj64t,You with your silver hair and no makeup and casual dress -- can still be beautiful. You are not a crone. That's the point.
10uj64t,"That's totally fine. But the word crone LITERALLY means ""an ugly, unpleasant old woman."" It's not the right word in any context. It DOES mean ugly. That's the definition of the word."
10uj64t,"And I'm not talking about ""standard beauty"" or movie star beauty or any of that shit. The point is, we can reject all of that and still not be UGLY. That's an ugly word and it's laden with self-hatred and the idea that we still only think of ""beauty"" in one very standard way."
10uj64t,It is there. Just scroll the comments.
10uj64t,THANK YOU.
10uj64t,"Exactly. There are different kinds of beauty. If you don't want to adhere to the standard forms, that's great! I've never given a shit about what men think! And I don't wear a lot of makeup, and I prefer jeans and sneakers to any other kind of outfit, etc. Fuck beauty ""standards."" But that doesn't mean I'm not fucking beautiful, and that we all aren't fucking beautiful at this stage of life. Beauty does not have to mean one thing. But ""ugly?"" That's just not an empowering word at all."
10uj64t,"Holy shit, it has nothing to do with the beauty industry. Fucking hell. You can be beautiful and have nothing to do with that nonsense. You are still thinking very, very conventionally and very much in the patriarchal way. I'm not talking about makeup and Botox, for fuck's sake. I'm talking about not being UGLY just because you don't buy into exactly that shit. That getting older and not caring about conventional ideas of beaty does NOT make you ugly. Not at all. 

Goddamn. This is some sad stuff. You think you are being empowering but you are still thinking like a cis het man about what women and beauty are."
10uj64t,"Of course! I feel ya, WvP has good intentions but I do feel that sometimes folks on there can be very, let's say ""protective"", of whatever their particular viewpoint is. I have found these other 2 subs to be very kind and a bit more ""on-task"" as well if that makes sense."
10uj64t,Yep. üíú
10uj64t,It‚Äôs ok! I‚Äôm sort of used to being ostracized lol
10uj64t,"Because I feel this sub is often very self-hating, very focused on their ""fading looks"" and honestly not remotely empowering when it comes to aging. Embracing an ugly word just seems to cement that particular vibe. 

Look, everyone do what you want. But there are so many better words and ways of thinking of ourselves at this stage than yet another word that means ""ugly and old WOMAN."" Men don't pull this shit with each other, and there is no reason we need to either.

But again -- if it makes you happy to embrace it, go ahead. Just please don't assume this is a word every 50-plus woman wants to be slapped with."
10uj64t,"But I like the word crone, it conjures up what the other poster said- living in the woods alone, self sufficient with a pet or two. I don‚Äôt think of ugly when I hear it regardless of whether that‚Äôs the literal definition."
10uj64t,Ugly is a patriarchal construct. Fuck yes I‚Äôm reclaiming crone for me. I‚Äôm not dealing with the approval of men anymore.
10uj64t,‚ù§Ô∏è
10uj64t,"Yeah. If other people find freedom in using the word I'm cool with that, personally. We don't all have to be a monolith. But I don't like it and don't feel empowered by it."
10uj64t,"Honestly it seems like you need to take a few deep breaths, you‚Äôre getting worked up over what someone else feels comfortable calling THEMSELVES."
10uj64t,"It completely does, even a cursory look at r/SASSwitches seems to be a good fit. I didn't even have a ""disagreement"", per se, but compared with the genuine sisterhood vibes I have experienced here in r/menopause, despite the fact that r/witchesvsthepatriarchy sells that inclusivity as their whole thing, in my experience it was not the case. I'm fine with discussion and adult conversation, disagreeing is par for the course, so it'd take more than that kind of thing to deter me, but yes ""protective"" is politely accurate."
10uj64t,Interesting conversation over on r/SASSwitches now stemming from the thread here!
10uj64t,That doesn't mean that it's ok
10uj64t,"If you don't want to use the word, then don't...? Doesn't mean that you have to shoot down others who want to. You've brought more negativity to this thread than anyone else from what I can see. This is no different than the debate about any other number of words that are used by some members of marginalized groups that face discrimination etc."
10uj64t,"I have a different understanding of what they are saying. I do not have the sense that they assume anything about anyone else and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre slapping terms on other women. 

I think it‚Äôs interesting that you‚Äôve said ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt do this kind of thing‚Äù multiple times. First, why is that relevant to you; second, possibly they don‚Äôt do this because they don‚Äôt have to. üò≥ There aren‚Äôt as many negative gendered terms for men as there are for women."
10uj64t,"I guess how I see it, crone, old woman, hag were used as ways to control women and mostly the ways women nursed communities. This was dangerous for the establishment and to organized religions. Where in pagan and polytheistic religions understood the power of women and the three faces of women: maiden, mother crone, also the images of life and death which come with that. Think of Hectate triple goddess. She encompasses all beauty and ugliness. So from a mental health prospective, embracing the crone archetype while aging is a way to embrace the strength in change and the wisdom acquired through this change, not something negative. When I think of crones I think of Baba Yaga who goes around invisible really because she is old and society still ignores older women, since historically older women are no longer useful to the over culture. Being a crone, a hag is a way to use magic and wisdom to navigate a new way to create life. Clarissa Pinkola Estes does a much better explanation on this. M. Scott Peck also discussed women and change. Also Maureen Murdock, Deanna J Conway, Jean Shinoda Bolen

10uj64t,"My beauty is for me -- it has nothing to do with men or with actual societal ideas of beauty. But just because I'm not prettying myself up for boys (I never really did this, ever) does not mean I am an ugly woman/crone, etc. I am beautiful for me. We all are. Crone is not a positive word. It never has been."
10uj64t,"I have said multiple times this isn't about men. Why does no longer dealing with men (I have never given three shits about men, really) make you ""ugly?"""
10uj64t,"I just saw, wonderful!"
10uj64t,"> I am beautiful for me. We all are. Crone is not a positive word. It never has been.

Now see, I agree with your first two sentences.  I **am** beautiful for me.  

At the same time, crone **is** a positive word for me.  I don't know why it can't be both ways.  No need for all of us to agree to abolish the word crone."
10uj64t,But no longer dealing with men doesn't make her ugly?  She never said that.
10hhjuz,"Oh, how I feel you my fellow sister in need of a mister. No hot flashes here, just a constant warmth that has me wearing shorts through the winter yet still sweating. Couple that with brain fog and I'm constantly forgetting where I put down my cold beer. Fun times. Hang in there my friend."
10hhjuz,You can try cooling scarves. They are basically fabric tubes with beads in them. You soak them in cold water and the pe beads turn into a gel that stays cool for quite awhile. You just wrap one around your neck and wear it all day. They drip a bit but not bad. I soak a bunch then keep them in a ziplock bag in the fridge. I get them at amazon. They've been a lifesaver.
10hhjuz,"You are a trooper!  I'm two months into Tamoxifen and already hitting up Dr. Google to see how long this will last.  

I have no tips, but I wanted to let you know that you have been heard, you are not alone, and you are not losing your mind."
10hhjuz,"This may seem overly simplistic, but one thing that I‚Äôve found that works for me is carrying around an ice pack and constantly replacing it with more from my freezer.  Of course, you can only do that if you‚Äôre home, but it‚Äôs a start.  ‚òπÔ∏è"
10hhjuz,"I have a suggestion for the hot feeling you're experiencing, along with the hot flashes & night sweats.

A wonderful lady suggested I try this body wash she uses. It's a minty tea tree body wash gel & boy does it leave my face, neck, chest, anywhere I use it feeling COLD. Like, I need to put on another layer cold!!! 

I've used it when I feel a hot flash hit & man it stops it & the cooling feeling lingers for a good while. 

I got mine on Amazon & they have different sizes. I hope this link worked but in case it didn't it's called Tingly Mint & Tea Tree Original Source. Clear bottle, green shower gel. The bottle I got was less than $7. 

I've used it everywhere, even my lady bits & I feel completely cold, clean & refreshed. 

I hope this helps & thanks again to whomever it was that suggested it to me! It works great & is now part of my daily anti-hot flash arsenal. Good luck!! 

[Tea Tree & Mint Body Wash](https://OriginalSourceMintandT250mlhttps://a./d/0NT3n5A)"
10hhjuz,"Tamoxifen is the cause of the depression. It is so miserable. If you switch to an  AI, you can have a different set of side effects."
10hhjuz,Sucking on really hot mints and showers with peppermint shower gel REALLY helps!! X
10hhjuz,"Hello my fellow night sweater and hot flasher. I also live in tanks and shorts, freeze my family out from having the a/c on, and have to change pj‚Äôs in the middle of the night from being drenched. 
Here are a few things that help me manage: I rub biofreeze or tiger balm on the back of my neck every night before bed. The menthol helps keep me cool for at least a few hours. 
Get an 8hr ice pack on Amazon. It stays cold all night and is great especially in the summer. Try to not eat within 3 hours of going to bed...especially spicy food. Capsaicin heats us up and we definitely don‚Äôt need that. 
Talk to your doc about having your hormone levels checked and look into HRT or bio-identical hormones. 
Despite being on the highest dose of HRT in patch form, I‚Äôm still a hot and sweaty mess. Blood work showed my FSH and Estradiol are still in the ‚Äúseverely menopausal‚Äù range, so I‚Äôm being switched to pills. Sometimes it‚Äôs trial & error, but this can be managed. We just have to be super noisy about it and keep at it until we get the answers and treatment we need. For context, I‚Äôm 40 and in surgical menopause. It wasn‚Äôt until my 3rd ovarian torsion this past August that I was taken seriously by the ER doc and rushed into surgery immediately."
10hhjuz,"Nothing earth-shattering, but I have an oscillating vertical fan in my living room and ( my bedroom when I can get away with it.) Even using it in summer with AC on it got so bad at some points.

There is a cooling mattress thing I saw somewhere,  but I think it's expensive.  Perhaps others will chime in with their tips. I know others have written a few in prior posts.

I know it is bad, and it sucks. But it will end. You could also try reading MENOPAUSE YOUR Management Your Way  by Dr. Barbara Taylor.  She offers full spectrum options from synthetic to herbal.  She is also on YouTube under Menopause Barbie.  There she goes into even more detail about all things menopause and all your options. 

Sending hugs!"
10hhjuz,Hi love! Thank you so much for sharing your experience.  It sounds miserable.  Please go to doctor. You need not suffer like this!!!!! You sound like you are in a living hell. This is not acceptable and you deserve better. Please hang in there it will get better xxxxx
10hhjuz,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through all of this cancer treatment and feeling hot all the time. I too am tired of feeling hot all time. Some things that have helped me - having supportive people in my life that I can talk to, ICE WATER in an insulated water jug (I like Rtic brand) at all times at my desk while working, dressing in layers, and cold showers. Hang in there, it can‚Äôt last forever!!"
10hhjuz,"I‚Äôm so terribly sorry. I‚Äôve spent more than a decade trying to get my temps back to a reasonable range and that was (mostly) WITH estrogen. 

Have you talked to your doc about Effexor? I‚Äôve been on a super-low dose (37.5mg extended release) for several months when I ‚Äúmaxed out‚Äù my estrogen dose. I think it has reduced the sweats some. I‚Äôve not gone up on the dose because I have been trying different HRT things, but perhaps there is a dose that could get you some relief? I know I‚Äôve read others‚Äô posts here about it helping the heat when estrogen wasn‚Äôt an option."
10hhjuz,"These are amazing as well for those hot, humid, sticky kinds days! Used them a lot in Georgia & when I was in Afghanistan & they do work."
10hhjuz,"Hey lady! Were you the kind one that suggested that tea tree mint shower gel to me a few weeks ago??? I think I recognize your name but anyhoo, it works so well!!!!! I actually get very cold when I use it in the shower so it's a very big win for me! Thank you for saving me some sanity!!!! I've been telling everybody I know."
10hhjuz,"OP is most likely not a candidate for HRT. She is taking Tamoxifen.  Her oncology team has probably advised her to avoid any supplements and patches containing hormones.

I'm in the same camp as OP and appreciate your tips about not eating prior to bedtime.  If I feel like a lot of my relief will come from lifestyle modifications as I have very few medical options."
10hhjuz,"If u don‚Äôt mind me asking what r you FSH levels? I‚Äôm post surgical menopause since 2019, I will be 49 in March. I still have one ovary . But this past summer was by far the absolute worst as far as all the symptoms go. Had EVERY single one. Not to mention our a/c went out so ya that was real fun. Spent 3 days/nights in the pool. Im on HRT patch and it has wiped everything out. My FSH is <30 says I‚Äôm post meno."
10hhjuz,"Yes, I do all those things. Some days it feels like it will last forever. My husband is fantastic, but most people don‚Äôt get it and are just sorry it‚Äôs happening."
10hhjuz,Ha ha I wondered how you got on..bloody fantastic stuff isn't it!!? Oh I'm so bloody happy for you xxx
10hhjuz,"Sorry to barge but yep, I'm on Tamoxifen as well. No HRT for me. Also, the side effects are brutal."
10hhjuz,"You are right. I‚Äôm not allowed HRT. It‚Äôs so frustrating that doctors don‚Äôt seem to care about the effects. The cancer is being treated, the patient be damned."
10hhjuz,"I had 1 ovary from when I was 21 to five months ago at 40. Within that span of time I experienced waves of peri symptoms of hot flashes, severe night sweats, brain fog, etc. My right ovary never functioned properly & needed a partial hysterectomy at 34 to remove uterus & rt. Fallopian tube. For 3 months prior to having my remaining ovary removed, I had the absolute worst drenching night sweats of my life...every single night. But my FSH, LH, and Estradiol levels were within normal range. So I seriously take that with a grain of salt. The first 2 months on HRT after surgery were amazing. No night sweats or hot flashes and I was happy. That was the best I have felt in almost 20 years. Now all the symptoms are back and my FSH is 41. I never present normally so I have to go by how I feel and less by lab work."
10hhjuz,It is the best!!! I'm so glad you mentioned it! Thanks so much!
10ty5yy,Never be sorry for posting here. It's so hard and such a weird experience
10ty5yy,I'm sorry you're having such a rough go of it.  Sending you hugs and hoping things get better.  This sub is a wealth of information and support so don't be a stranger!
10ty5yy,"Yes, visit as often as you need. It may be time to try and find an enlightened GYN. Keep track of your symptoms.  Look over the posts here and the mod page for more tips.

You are not going crazy. We are with you."
10ty5yy,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling.  It‚Äôs hard.  But being in perimenopause at 40 is normal.   No one‚Äôs ever ready for it.    

It‚Äôs never ‚Äúhappened to grannies ‚Äú.      Do some research.   We‚Äôve been misinformed but it‚Äôs completely normal for this to be happening now.   I really noticed my symptoms at age 42 but I think things were happening before and I just didn‚Äôt connect the dots."
10ty5yy,"I‚Äôm so sorry things have been so rough for you.

I relate to pretty much everything in your post. The BO is so BAD, and never used to be an issue before my mid-thirties. I‚Äôm riding the self-esteem and insecurity struggle bus as well.  I think I‚Äôve been in peri since about age 36 honestly. 

Virtual hugs going out to you. You‚Äôre definitely not alone in this experience üíô"
10ty5yy,I also thought I had MS... My symptoms were ticking all of its boxes. HRT has sorted it all out. It's shit. Xxxx
10ty5yy,"When i say it happened to grannies, I didn‚Äôt 
literally mean like 90 years old. I meant where i grew up this stuff was NEVER talked about and the mere hushed mention of menopause didn‚Äôt start happening until 50+, by which time most of the women i knew had grandchildren. Hence, the association of it with grannies in my head. It was like the final nail in the coffin of being ‚Äúold‚Äù, so i was talking about WHY i am so freaked out by it, because of how i grew up.

Sorry, i just feel like your ‚Äúdo your research‚Äù had an unspoken ‚Äúyou idiot‚Äù on the end of it, and now i feel like just crawling back into my hole and not reaching out for fear of being called stupid. I am also really over sensitive rn so this might all just be perception on my end."
10ty5yy,"I don‚Äôt mean anything rude by saying do research.   Unfortunately we don‚Äôt learn about perimenopause and we have to do our own research.   That‚Äôs all.   

Perimenopause can start in our 40‚Äôs and last 10 years or even longer.   I reached menopause by age 48.   And that‚Äôs normal.  The age range is quite varied but you experiencing peri symptoms at your age is normal.   It‚Äôs a lot to deal with and important to know what to potentially expect, hence doing your own research.    There‚Äôs nothing rude intended.  It‚Äôs a fact that we all have to find out what is happening.  Almost no one on earth is talking about these issues to their daughters.   We have to seek the information, but thankfully it‚Äôs easier now than it‚Äôs ever been before."
10ty5yy,"I get being very sensitive. I don‚Äôt think they meant it the way you took it. 

I have had a hard time with this life transition and it‚Äôs not over yet. 

I agree that 40 feels like too young for perimenopause to start but it seems like it‚Äôs not uncommon. In fact, I think my perimenopause started around 39‚Äìwhen I got pregnant for the first time ever (as far as I know). 

I thought the crazy night sweats I was having were related to the pregnancy, and they may have been, but they continued after the miscarriage. 

There were other symptoms as well, but I think that‚Äôs where and when it started. 

Anyway, hang in there and keep talking about it. 

Maybe look for a provider in your area (if you‚Äôre in US or Canada) from the NAMS provider search and make an appointment? Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to go on HRT or need to, but maybe it would feel good to talk about it with a professional and get their take. If this is perimenopause, it‚Äôs good to start thinking about how you want to handle it‚Äîor not‚Äînow. 

(But if you‚Äôre in a bigger metro area, and this is my opinion only, watch out for any who do pellets. There are clearly many women who use them and are happy with them, but based on what I have read, it‚Äôs not a treatment endorsed by any establishment healthcare groups, even as ‚Äúoff label‚Äù use, and it comes with potential additional risks.  And because I feel that way, I would feel remiss not sharing that caution. Ok, I‚Äôm done! üôÇ)"
10ty5yy,"Im sorry for yelling at you, i was being too over sensitive and misunderstood what you meant‚Ä¶"
10ty5yy,üíú
10wbhg7,"Omg helloooo!! Been tryin to navigate this island 2yrs w 4 specialists!! I too am tryin hrt, 1yr no cycle so far but besides hot flushing i have bad muscle fatigue that NONE of these fools can diagnose or help!! Ps my positive labs are ANA 1.160 and SSA last 2 yrs. I even tried plaquenil 6mos no help. üíñüíöxo"
10wbhg7,"One word: Same.

I am so sorry this happened to us."
10wbhg7,"Yes, I had the same relieved feeling when I was reading about peri too! And it can go on for ten years whaaat!! My periods got a whole lot shorter in recent years and i thought i was just lucky, but then all the other symptoms started coming and nothing much more than a shrug from doctors... that in itself is enough to depress you. I hope youre able to find HRT! That's my plan as well."
10wbhg7,"Please keep us posted on your experience.  I really hope it helps. I agree with you.  The way doctors blow women off during this time on our lives is unreal.   I literally feel like I'm falling apart. I never did recreational drugs, but I have considered trying cbd gummies or going back on birth control."
10wbhg7,"Thank you, I'm sorry to hear of your experience. I have muscle fatigue too, can barely get up the stairs in my house. I'm not familiar with plaquenil, will look it up. Are you on any meds that could cause muscle fatigue? I use temazepam for sleep occasionally and it seems to make muscle fatigue much worse."
10wbhg7,Thanks for reading. Sending good wishes for better health for you too.
10wbhg7,"Yes... debilitating symptoms for years would not fly with men.
I hope your HRT efforts are successful!"
10wbhg7,"Thanks. Yes, that is how it feels, it's like whack -a-mole with the health issues. Cannabis is legal here (Canada) but doesn't help me. I drank a lot of red wine for a few years! But trying to clean that up now."
10wbhg7,No on nothing!! All.changed is perimenapause!! Anything help u??
10wbhg7,"Just hoping hormone replacement will help but I seem a ways out from starting it, trying to be patient!"
10wbhg7,Aww im gona start asap!
10wwvyw,"I never had anxiety over nothing until peri and much worse the longer it continues.  (Not sure if I'm  peri or post due to partial hysterectomy.)

I totally understand and mine is much worse in the morning as well.  I initially thought that was because nighttime is my safe zone where I'm home and tucked away from the world, but then I kept hearing about other women where it's an upon waking phenomenon as well so maybe there is more to it.  

I'm sorry I can't be of practical help since I'm not on HRT and also struggling for a way to deal with this, just letting you know you're not alone and this totally sucks.  It's really hard to overcome a panicked start to the day."
10wwvyw,Like you I'm in postmenopause and unfortunately is still dealing with symptoms.This is my third week on the Combipatch and anxiety is still one of my main symptom the other symptoms have gotten better.Don't know if I'm dealing with anxiety or nervousness from the Combipatch cause it is one of the side effects.I do notice if I eat sugar or don't rest as well the night before anxiety is worse.I can say that the Combipatch has helped with hot flashes and I'm able to eat certain foods without getting a hot flash afterwards.First couple of weeks on the Combipatch I was sleeping at least six to eight hrs.but now I'm back to waking up through the night.At least I'm not suffering with the stiff joints anymore so I'm assuming that HRT is helping.
10wwvyw,Yes.  Every morning upon waking.  It‚Äôs terrible!
10wwvyw,"Yes, I would wake up early in the am with physical feelings of anxiety. This would be almost before I had  consciously woken up to think  or worry about anything, so little chance to get ahead of it. Tight chest, churning stomach, feeling of panic/doom. For me HRT helped significantly reduce this feeling, both in intensity and frequency, after about 2 months of taking it. Hasn‚Äôt completely gone away but much more bearable"
10wwvyw,"It has to do with the circadian rhythm and morning cortisol. The only way to reduce it a bit is diligent stress reducing and anxiety reducing activities all day and having a strict calm night routine.

I do all that and it has moved from ‚Äûunbearable‚Äú to ‚Äûawful‚Äú and from ‚Äûwake up after 2 hours‚Äú to ‚Äûwake up after 4-5 hours‚Äú. Haven‚Äôt managed to improve further."
10wwvyw,"I am post meno and I've been dealing with moderate anxiety for over a year. Mine can also include tachycardia as well (fast heartbeat). It usually hits me at night and can keep me awake for a long while. My doctor prescribed Buspirone for me. Its been working well, though lately I'm thinking I need to go in for a medication tune up. I had never experienced anxiety up until 15 months ago."
10wwvyw,Thanks for your response. It is good to know I‚Äôm not alone. I hope you can find some relief as well!
10wwvyw,"Great (not that you have the symptoms) I‚Äôm glad to hear that I‚Äôm not the only one and that something does help it! 
Did your symptoms  ever last throughout  the day? Just curious - mine can last all day long even though  I‚Äôm working or doing other things 8 still have the physical symptoms but I don‚Äôt mentally feel anxious at all. It‚Äôs crazy!"
10wwvyw,"My experience very similar to yours except my anxiety episodes would happen at random times of the day, sometimes all day.  Hormone therapy has helped a lot!"
10wwvyw,Thanks for the response I do calming  activities but I will start throughout the day.
10wwvyw,I‚Äôm glad the buspirone is working for you. I had a bad reaction to that so had to stop taking it. Thanks for the response!
10wwvyw,"Yes some days it would last. Mostly just an hour or two, sometimes well into the day. It is so bloody odd, feeling anxious but without a reason. Really feels like your body is doing this to you"
10oztjn,"I have a daughter around the same age as you. What really helps me is that she sees what needs to happen around the house, dogs, food etc., and sees when I am really struggling. I need someone to step up, be observant and stand up for me. Although she can still be a pain sometimes, we still have a good laugh over stuff. So, her comfort is in the form of doing little things for me which I am forever grateful."
10oztjn,"I have a daughter who is younger than you (she's still a teen) but she helps me so much just by being herself! She makes me laugh, I love hearing stories about her friends and social life, we go out to dinner once a week together (just us), we do workouts and long walks together. Being around her is so immensely cheering. 

Just be natural around your mom and keep an upbeat attitude. Tell her all about what's going on in your life. Offer to take her out to lunch, or to go makeup shopping (or whatever you two like to shop for). Go for a walk with her or take an exercise class together."
10oztjn,"Release yourself from any guilt you feel. Today is a new day. Be there to listen to your mom. Pray with her (if you pray), reassure her that she is a wonderful mother and a beautiful human being. If you have trouble emoting this you can always write her a letter. 
Watch some fun tv shows together. Help
around the house. 
Just sit with her and hold her hand. You sound like a wonderful daughter. You are blessed to have one another. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª"
10oztjn,"How lovely if you to be so concerned. Do not be hard on yourself for not being more emotional. Knowing that you care goes a long way.

You might ask your mom if she had been seen for Mrt/hrt hormone replacement.  She is right at the age for it barring any prior health problems. 

Have her check the wiki here for more resources that she could access."
10oztjn,"Honestly. Chores. 

And just keep talking to her. Ask her how she‚Äôs feeling regularly, ask her about her symptoms, ask her to talk to you about it so that it doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise to you. She may not feel comfortable dumping it all on you as a friend, but if you can phrase it in a ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs educational for me‚Äù you might get her to open up a little bit, and talking about issues can often help us deal with them easier. So win-win! It is educational and she will probably get some relief just getting it off her chest.

No mention of a spouse - is there none or are they that relevant to daily life? If it‚Äôs the latter, getting someone else‚Äôs ass in gear with chores and whatnot might help too if you can."
10oztjn,"OP, you‚Äôre so sweet and your mom is so lucky to have you. Words matter, talk nicer about yourself, you seem like a wonderful and caring daughter and your mom is blessed to have a daughter who cares and who is looking to help. You‚Äôve already got some great suggestions but wanted to give you some positive feedback about you! ‚òÆÔ∏èüçÄ"
10oztjn,Ask her.    Let her know you are there for her and ask what she needs.
10oztjn,"Thank you so much for sharing. Of course, I help with housework and keep her company when I'm home (and the amount of times I ask her about how she's feeling... almost drives her insane I think!). But I'm away for university most of the year‚ÄîI can't be home with her for more than one or two weeks at a time, usually. Which saddens me very much."
10oztjn,"Thank you so much for sharing. Unfortunately I'm not the best at appearing upbeat when my family isn't well‚ÄîI get nervous and it shows. But I'll try my best to be upbeat for my mother. I'm aware it doesn't help her for me to be down too.

I include her in my life as much possible."
10oztjn,"Thank you for your kind and comforting words. I hold a lot of guilt inside me‚ÄîI've convinced myself that I'm not good enough of a daughter, even though I know that thought would never even cross my mother's mind (or my father's, too). I'm very blessed. I'll spend as much time with her as possible."
10oztjn,"Thank you very much for your words and information. I can't get her to check the wiki (english isn't our language), but I'll take a look at it myself."
10oztjn,"Thank you for responding. I always help with housework when I'm home‚ÄîI want to be as helpful as possible. I ask her how she's feeling so many times she gets annoyed. But she always plays her feelings down, which I wish she wouldn't do with me.

There is my father, they've been married for a long time. He is sick with Parkinson's, but he still helps with chores. He cooks as much as her, helps with the dishes, takes the trash out..."
10oztjn,That's very sweet of you to say. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10oztjn,I ask her all the time‚Äîalmost annoyingly so!
10oztjn,"You are welcome. Good for you helping her. Perhaps you could listen to Dr. Barbara Taylor on YouTube.  She talks about everything about females in the peri to post-menopause years. 

She had well researched information with every possible option available to women today. 

Doctors tend to throw antidepressants at women who just need to have hormones balanced. She may need both. But certainly, she needs a better caregiver than just a doctor who prescribed antidepressants. This happened to me, and it is still difficult to get hrt. 

You all need to be persistent on her behalf. It's the best thing you can do for her. That said, it's the best thing to prepare you when your turn comes, plus you can educate other women older than you as well as your peers. By that time, hopefully, this stigma won't exist anymore."
10oztjn,"Oh, okay, sick is another thing entirely and slipped my mind. Fair enough! Sounds like you‚Äôre both doing what you can on that front!

I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre doing the generic ‚Äúeverything okay?‚Äù so please correct me, but have you tried asking her more specific questions? Stuff like ‚Äúwhat are your symptoms?‚Äù Or ‚Äúis that a hot flash?‚Äù Maybe getting her to think about them in a more clinical way could help her talk it out for herself. And don‚Äôt grill her! Just the odd question here and there when the chance presents itself. Unless you get a conversation going about the entire topic, then keep going!

If there‚Äôs anything going on in your life that your could talk to her about would also help her take her mind off her mood and focus on helping you. I know I go through funks where I‚Äôm upset that my kid doesn‚Äôt need me as much, and she‚Äôs only a teen and I didn‚Äôt like the needy age! 

Is your dad up for making a date night something more routine? And you could throw in a mom/daughter day too. And even a whole family day too. Gets everyone out of the house doing fun stuff instead of just chores and work. Go see things around town you‚Äôve never bothered with, see if there‚Äôs anything that she‚Äôs wanted to go see but never has; festivals or stores or museums or whatever."
10oztjn,"Oh, yes, I'm guilty of grilling her when I'm worried. I'll try to bring it down a little.

I talk to her about (almost) everything in my life, always, so in that front I think I'm doing well.

My dad's sickness tends to get worse at night, so it's rare for them to go out at night. But every once in a while they travel just the two of them, for example. Thank you for the ideas, I appreciate it!"
10nw8un,"Just know hormonal tests are notoriously inaccurate...so to 'prove' you are indeed menopausal (aka post-meno) you'd need **a series of hormonal tests** to confirm that.  Otherwise, one test at one point in time doesn't tell you much of anything.  Your hormones could be swinging in a completely different direction 2 weeks from now."
10nw8un,"Aww, I can feel your feels just though this post. This stuff is such an emotional rollercoaster.
*virtual hugs*"
10nw8un,"Awwww. I totally get it. It's strange looking at the lab report and seeing that your own values/numbers correspond with the menopausal range. 

There's a finality to it, I guess ... to seeing it in black and white, scientifically stated by your own blood samples.

It sounds like you have a wonderful life and a lot of happiness, and that puts you ahead of so many others. Grieve the loss of your fertility, because you have a right to. But also try to think about all the really good things about your life :)"
10nw8un,"Welcome. I remember that feeling when AARP sent me a membership card when I was 49 1/2. I was insulted, incensed,  and all-around poopy feeling about it. Like they rushed my aging. Lol"
10nw8un,"Totally get it. I'm gonna be 52 this spring. I have an amazing teenage daughter and a cute 53-year-old husband who has all his hair, LOL. I like my job and am doing fine career-wise. My menopausal symptoms aren't that bad (I mostly just hate that I've gained some weight and my body has sorta ""reshaped"" itself). 

It's just freaking WEIRD to realize you are in menopause. That \*boom\*, two days ago you were in college, yesterday you were taking your kids to preschool, and today...yeah. Now you're HERE. 

It's just weird. Have some wine. It's almost February, we won't tell anyone."
10nw8un,"Aw you‚Äôre in with a great group, gal. We‚Äôre here for you!"
10nw8un,I‚Äôm nearly 50 and had a hysterectomy last summer. My kids are grown and have their own families. Even though I had my tubes tied nearly 25 years ago I have felt the sting of the permanence of infertility- even though I have not been and in fact the end report said my endometrial lining had atrophied and it was fibroid tumors that were hemorrhaging that caused bleeding. It‚Äôs crazy what our minds tell us when the facts are already there.
10nw8un,"No offence to your doctor, but you should be on hrt already. It would still work post-meno, but it is generally better to start in peri if you can tolerate it and have no underlying medical conditions.

And what you are feeling is perfectly normal. It's probably more about what you think (conscious vs. Unconscious thoughts) you may have lost vs. what is happening. What your own perception of what a woman is or what you were brought up to believe.

Your thoughts and feelings are perfectly valid and common during this time. It's a type of grief
Big virtual hugs"
10nw8un,Good to know- thank you. I‚Äôll ask my doctor about that.
10nw8un,"Yes if they show high FSH and so on, all they really show is one is in the menopause transition, but they don't say where one is in it.  And symptoms also tend to show that."
10nw8un,"and that organization is such a scam, who even wants to be a member, why are they allowed access to everyone's date of birth somehow?"
10nw8un,"Yeah, I think that shocked me the most. üò≥üòµ‚Äçüí´But thinking back, it was just at the dawn of the internet era, so we had not been completely mined of all our info by every greedy predator out there yet.üòñ"
10xzke4,"I use natural oils (coconut oil) Then look for products with Hyaluronic acid, they hold moisture on the skin for longer. Then reduce alcohol (easier said than done) and hydrate hydrate hydrate ü•Ç"
10xzke4,"For me, the biggest help with the dry skin is routine consistency. I just use Nivea but I keep a big pump bottle of it in my shower so it can‚Äôt be forgotten. I towel off just a bit and then apply. When your skin is still warm from your shower, it absorbs the lotion so much better."
10xzke4,"I have a whole after shower moisturizer routine. Doesn‚Äôt take over long and it has really helped. I have a balm made of natural oils and beeswax. (No scent no additives.) I rub it in while I am still damp almost wet.  That leaves me a bit greasy so I had to add the next step. I go over my whole self again, this time with a combo of body lotion and hyaluronic acid. I do not know why this helps the oils not be greasy, but it just leaves me smooth and most unsaharalike."
10xzke4,"I love Osea sea kelp oil and I mix it with First Aid Beauty‚Äôs extra deep moisturizer (forget what it‚Äôs called but you can buy a tub of it üòÇ) - they don‚Äôt have tons of alcohol or weird additives, both are vegan. After a bath or shower I just slather it, face and everything. Helps me fall asleep too I think."
10xzke4,"Drink lots of water, use body oil and then CeraVe lotion."
10xzke4,Quitting alcohol was actually the easiest thing for me in all this.
10xzke4,Teach me your ways master because nobody is prying wine from my old hands üòù
10xzke4,Well if you know it‚Äôs affecting your health in a negative way and you still can‚Äôt stop then maybe you need to seek help.   I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs funny actually.
110ky7o,"Yep.  Im introverted by nature, but it's ramped up a great deal in peri."
110ky7o,"I am struggling with this now. I‚Äôve noticed an increase in anxiety and low-grade depression. I have always been an introvert and homebody, but this feels different. I don‚Äôt want to do the things I normally enjoy. Everything feels like so much work. I‚Äôm not even looking forward to a much anticipated vacation. 

I‚Äôm at the point that I‚Äôm ready to go see someone."
110ky7o,"I‚Äôve been somewhat introverted my whole life.  Now, between COVID after effects and being in Peri, I would be okay not speaking to anyone for weeks."
110ky7o,"I read all the comments. Very good takes from everyone. Most of everything that needs to be said has, you guys are the best.

HOWEVER this seems kind of natural and good for me. 

OF COURSE we want to be left alone. 50 fucking years of being there for every single other entity? We are all in the gen X range and now we have our parents, our partners, our kids, our pets and our community to care for while managing an enormous emotional load?

OF COURSE we want to be left alone for 5 fucking minutes and 3 weeks might restore my sanity to continue to deal with this shit. 

I think it is valid and we are coming into our own and finally starting to scream into the void LEAVE ME IN PEACE, and yeah, that is hormonal to a degree, but i own that mindset. 

I'm rightfully, righteously tired. Bite me."
110ky7o,"Yes. I have always been prone to withdrawing. My husband calls it ""clamming up"" since I tend to park myself in my spot in the bed, put on headphones, and crawl deep into my shell. It's always been one of my anxiety coping skills‚Äînot actually a very productive coping skill, but it's one I'm finding myself crawling into a lot more lately.

I find clearing my calendar of everything nonessential and then forcing the effort to communicate at least once a day is helpful. Otherwise, eat well, go for a walk (if I can make myself), and sleep as best as I can. This peri shit is just... relentless."
110ky7o,Yes I feel I am often looking at my life as an observer and I don't like what I see
110ky7o,"Yep, I‚Äôm done. 16 months into post-Meno, on hrt, stopped alcohol, caffeine, sugar‚Ä¶still full of anxiety, can‚Äôt sleep, feel like a burden, and I‚Äôm just over it. I wish everyone would f*ck off.
Hope you all have better luck."
110ky7o,"Ok so. This might be a low key temporary form of depression. A *lot* of the symptoms of depression are protective things your body uses to force a safe recovery from illness, injury, overwork, or danger. 


Example: stay inside, stay inactive, sleep a lot, eat plenty of food? Great if you're recovering from a big injury or a broken bone. You don't want to be out  someplace at a party with lots of running kids who might bump into that broken bone and make it worse, and you need extra calories to heal.  


One problem is, your brain can't tell the difference between the physical stress of doing things and emotional stress from a shit situation. Another is that your brain can get ""stuck"" in recovery mode, especially if the stress goes on for a long time. And sometimes brains just get stuck that way because that's their thing. 


But what's that got to do with menopause? 


So in menopause your body is changing drastically, and your brain recognizes that something about your body which it has always relief in to be true for decades is off. And maybe it responds to this by going ""I don't know what's going on but we're gonna play it safe and hide out until we figure it out."""
110ky7o,"All the fucking time. I'm not confirmed in Peri, but based on symptoms, am pretty sure I'm there."
110ky7o,I like being alone. Hate having to to back to office.
110ky7o,"Yep. I often fantasize about not being married and living all alone with a different dog then we now have. My husband is my dogs person. 
Then I think, you‚Äôre fucking a crazy person, your husband is gold and loves you so much and as soon as you were living alone, all you‚Äôd want is him back. I am a crazy person. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
110ky7o,"I wish I could have my own house.  I love my husband and kids, but I just want to be left alone."
110ky7o,"Well. I've learned that I am one of those introverts who do well, generally, in social settings, but there is an expiration to it at which point I am ""peopled out"". Always been that way-- in high school I was bubbly and friendly and social, but I'd come home and have to decompress. Working & church was the same. People assumed I was an extrovert, who got moody. Nope. And I'm finding now, I get peopled out faster. Even with my own family, which has been hard over the years anyway because, 8 kids. 


Extended withdrawal for me indicates depression. There've been a few notable instances where I really should've sought help and didn't. I  finally talked to my doctor because I want HRT, and she put me on low dose Effexor until results come back from an upcoming mammogram. I cannot believe the difference. I still like my alone time, but it's not a desperate, fight-or-flight urge now with internet searches that would likely get me committed. Or arrested. Speaking of which, I should go do some, uhhh.... housecleaning. ü•¥"
110ky7o,"I‚Äôm sure I like to be alone anyway, but it‚Äôs impossible for me to fit into my clothes. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go through the process of elimination at the closet. Nothing is worth it."
110ky7o,i don‚Äôt even wanna talk here. lol
110ky7o,"I definitely went through this last summer. I even told a friend on the other side of the country to stop calling me, because she can only chat while she‚Äôs on long drives, which means deep, long conversations late at night for me. It was just too overwhelming. 

What helped was to reduce stress and commitments. If I want to do something I do it, if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll pass. I‚Äôm still a homebody, but at least I‚Äôm not throwing guilt and shame for no-showing on the pile."
110ky7o,"Yeah, I'm through the worst of the menopause barrage. For awhile it felt crippling. Anxiety attacks, super-low energy, joint pain, brain fog. I also isolated and didn't really want to go out and do my usual thing which is seeing live music....of course Covid threw a wrench into those plan for years.

It does get better. Last night I went out for the first time since the pandemic to see my very favorite band play (they aren't from the U.S., so years can go by before they come to my city) and I danced and enjoyed until the club plugged the plug at nearly 2 am. My energy is back. Holy crap I feel better! And back to my old self, only far more relaxed and laid back.

Hang in there, ladies. Better days ahead!"
110ky7o,"Hubs and I just bought a cabin in a rather remote mountain location. Think dirt road for miles. I'm very excited to move in. I want a garden and some fruit trees, and to be left alone. The grocery is about 30 miles, and that's fine. It will hone my meal planning skills."
110ky7o,"Sure. Estrogen is a very powerful hormone and it can drive you to do certain things. Evolutionarily it just makes sense that seeking community is more important when you‚Äôre younger.

So I‚Äôve had to get more intellectual and strategic as I‚Äôve gotten older. It‚Äôs not in my best interest to isolate, so I force myself to do things despite not feeling like it."
110ky7o,Yeah I had a burst of energy last month and told a friend I definitely wanted to go to a social event soon.  Then it passed and now i have no interest
110ky7o,I am extremely extroverted but today has been a quiet withdrawn day.
110ky7o,"You just described me, mostly withdrawn. I'm better with people but when I'm alone I don't get out of bed unless I have to. Don't want to do anything. I've become a TV movie junkie. I have to work, study, but at home my bed just becomes everything. 

It came with menopause, and the non hrt options I have to accept. One of them is anti depressants which I wouldn't take it if didn't work so well for severe thermo attacks which were every 15 minutes day and night,I would have steam coming off me in -2C¬∞ outside and be soaking wet and freezing at the same time. Just stopped taking synthetic megesterol and have stopped being as exhausted, just got over radiotherapy fatigue, so I'm feeling good, but, don't want anything anymore."
110ky7o,"YES. I've developed serious RBF and even my SO's like.... um, are you safe to talk to? Because I don't want to die from saying the wrong thing at the right time. 

I've become far more introverted over time (though, I suspect it's in direct proportion to my tolerance for BS and idiotic people). Literally had to force myself to leave the house yesterday to do what needed to be done."
110ky7o,"Yep. I'm in ""trying to hold it together"" mode. I was invited to a super bowl party and just can't do it."
110ky7o,I disassociate often because I am neurospicy (neurodivergent for any typicals out there). üòÜ
110ky7o,Yes. The end of December I started tracking my roller coaters mood and how it correlates with my period. I can see how depression and anxiety kick in around the time cycle charts say my hormones have dropped.
110ky7o,YESSSSSS Ma‚Äôam! Ugh. Its love or hate.
110ky7o,Same here. How can I fix this problem? Does HRT help?
110ky7o,"Just going to throw out there that it might be the time of year. Ive been like this for years during the winter, shorter days, cold weather, all contribute. Throw menopause on top and it's understandable"
110ky7o,"Also, to add, estrogen helps dramatically. So can therapy and a good old antidepressant. And better sleep. Ugh. This is hard."
110ky7o,"My goodness, you just described me. I suffered from PTSD, anxiety and depression before menopause but I‚Äôve been able to get through out and out the other side. Now, I just want to get my life over and done with. I have no motivation, I don‚Äôt want to talk to people and I just want to go off grid and never have to worry about anyone or anything else ever again. I‚Äôm really low at the moment but I know I will be back up there and happy again soon. Peri menopause is exhausting !!"
110ky7o,Wow your title summarizes how I feel except now it's gettng closer to a 3 week fog with only 1 good week. ü•¥
110ky7o,Me too. I assumed it was from COVID causing me to fully dig into my introversion. I don't see my friends or feel like going out anywhere. I'm very happy at home right my own thing (or doing nothing). But I'm in peri too so now I'm rethinking what I thought. ü´£
110ky7o,"Yeah, there's a few times I've thought ""I must be ovulating"" because lately the appetite followed by irritability has been happening just like it did back when my ovaries worked."
110ky7o,Yes I think this is a thing I do too but it might reactionary idk
110ky7o,"Yes.  And I‚Äôm naturally very outgoing and enjoy being social.  I do not feel myself and have a very short fuse now, which makes me not want to be around people.  I‚Äôm having such a hard time because I‚Äôm experiencing this kind of early and my daughter is just starting puberty, so we are both incredibly hormonal!"
110ky7o,All.the.time.
110ky7o,Just done
110ky7o,Are you on hormones? That helped somewhat for me. But I still have a several day stretch that I want to be away from everyone bc I feel like I‚Äôm the worst and I‚Äôm annoyed by EVERYTHING.
110ky7o,"All my life I‚Äôve been extroverted. So many friends! If someone new joined a group I would literally walk up to them and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be your friend!‚Äù
Now, no way. 
An acquaintance stopped by our house recently to pick up an item and our kids ran off to play. They didn‚Äôt stay long and as she started to leave she cheerily said, ‚ÄúWe should get together. Our kids seem to really like each other.‚Äù Of course I smiled and nodded. When she drove away I turned to my husband with my new expressionless face and said, ‚ÄúZERO desire to get together with her.‚Äù And she‚Äôs very nice! I just don‚Äôt want to be bothered. :/"
110ky7o,"Yes! I don‚Äôt feel depressed per se, but just completely uninterested in socializing. Now I understand how older people can just be satisfied sitting, reading, watching TV. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù it before. My grandma was super active 70+ til she died. She always wanted to do and see new things. Maybe I‚Äôll be like her later or maybe I‚Äôll be a hermit."
110ky7o,Yes but I also have a 12 yr old boy who follows me around like a puppy. I get 0 alone time except when I am working. So I get drained pretty fast and want to just be alone!
110ky7o,YEP. I‚Äôve become a total hermit.
110ky7o,Me too!
110ky7o,"Yes! I am in chemical menopause at 31 and I‚Äôm having a mare with it. One minute I‚Äôm confident and outgoing, happy and sociable. The next‚Ä¶complete recluse! The thought of socialising even with family (other than my husband) fills me with dread and I just want to curl up on the sofa with a tv series and no social contact at all. I have tried to see if there is a pattern to this but it seems to just come and go with no reason as far as I‚Äôm aware."
110ky7o,"Yep. ""Switched off"" describes it perfectly, and it's been going on for a few years now. No desire for socializing. Even when I force myself, I can't wait to go home and be in silence. I have always been an introvert, but this is something else."
110ky7o,"Yes. I do this a lot. I also unplug, pretty much every weekend, always on Sunday. It drives my family and friends crazy. I can't help it. It's who I am. I like being alone, I like reading & watching T, listening to music, etc."
110ky7o,"Yes, but I‚Äôve always been like that. It‚Äôs so very frustrating."
110ky7o,Oh yeah.
110ky7o,All the yes to this!
110ky7o,"Absolutely spot on. I thought it was just me. I even find, when I'm in that mood,  that I get annoyed by people messaging me or inviting me to things.  I don't want to have to answer/respond to anyone!"
110ky7o,"I feel the same way. DH is starting to comment that I have been giving one word answers when he talks to me. This is the second month of this (malaise?) for me. I really hope this passes, I don't know how to snap out of this."
110ky7o,"I have always been super social. A total extrovert. Ya, not lately. I just want to be left alone. Yes, I'm being very quiet. Because I just have nothing to say and I don't want to talk. My poor husband thinks I'm mad at him when I'm not a little chatty Kathy."
110ky7o,"Yes I have always been an introvert and prefer to be alone and had anxiety. Now it‚Äôs crushing depression that is making me close to losing my job and I feel like a completely different person. Detached, disassociated and withdrawn. I went thru menopause at 52 and I‚Äôm 55. This all happened summer before my 54th birthday I have no explanation except I got the covid vax the summer this feeling came over me which was 2021"
110ky7o,"Yes!  I will have a few good days, maybe a week, out of a month of feeling good and energized.  The rest of the time I'm struggling to put clothes on in the morning and do anything.  I'm starting to force myself to do things because I just don't ever leave the house.  I work remotely and I'm divorced so my interaction with the world can (and lately has been) zero if I want it that way.

I signed myself up for an expensive 4 week evening pottery class in March.  I like making pottery so I will go.  I need something."
110ky7o,"I definitely struggle with that. I feel fairly charged at the beginning of the week but by the end I can take being unplugged to a new level. I have some big projects going on and I can force myself out to do it but by Sunday I have zero motivation to do anything. It feels like I‚Äôm just wasting whatever downtime I have. I sort of think of it as recharging but it‚Äôs only to start the week of demands and running all over the place over again. 

I appreciate everyone weighing in on this because I‚Äôve been uncertain how much was about meno and how much is about coming back ‚Äúonline‚Äù after Covid.

I feel myself more engaged when I have a project going on that I‚Äôm excited about. But my OFF switch seems to be fully deployed as soon as I get the chance."
110ky7o,Peri and Covid turned me into a hermit. :)
110ky7o,"Yes, yes and yes! Same here."
110ky7o,I hope you do get some help. Well done for accepting you need help and I hope whoever you see takes you seriously.
110ky7o,You just expressed exactly how I have been feeling! I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way. I have a good life‚Ä¶..I just can‚Äôt get out of it. I am debating if I want to take meds. I‚Äôm tired of feeling so blah.
110ky7o,"Yes! I don‚Äôt want to do anything. I thought it was from Covid and being home all the time but honestly I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôve felt that way for a few years now. I don‚Äôt want to make dinner, I don‚Äôt want to clean etc. but when I sit all day and do nothing I feel like crap. I have been forcing myself to workout 4-5 times a week and it helps me. I force myself to take an hour to clean or whatever before I can sit and do nothing."
110ky7o,It helps a lot. I have been in therapy for years while dealing with major depression and at the same time going through peri-menopause and post-menopause.
110ky7o,Yes to all of this!!!
110ky7o,Totally know that üòî
110ky7o,"I also think covid has a lot to do with it. I actually enjoyed the peace and the quiet streets.

Now I struggle to say 'bless you' when a loved one sneezes."
110ky7o,I wanna be left alone for ddaaayyyyyysssss
110ky7o,"For my 40th a few years back I bought myself a holiday. On my own.  No one else with me. 
 Two weeks on the other side of the country.  Alone. It was the BEST birthday I've ever had.  I went out for dinner alone. I watched movies alone. Art galleries alone.  I 100% recommend."
110ky7o,"I think that you may possibly be my long lost twin, separated at birth...GMTA! 
üòÜü§£"
110ky7o,That last line needs to be on a T shirt.
110ky7o,Yes! I have a conference coming up in another state for work. I‚Äôm excited to spend a few days away and have my own hotel room ALONE! some of my friends want to come with me‚Ä¶ I am trying to convince them not to though lol! I may just tell them it‚Äôs not gonna workout maybe next time!
110ky7o,Do you see a pattern in how you are feeling? Great advice with eating well and walking. I don't do either that much.
110ky7o,Me too!
110ky7o,"I feel like I'm on the outside looking in, everyone seems to have their shit together their normal accept me!"
110ky7o,"I too wish everyone would fuck off, including my nearest and dearest who have not done a single thing wrong. It breaks their heart and mine that I'm not interested in having a full blown conversation.

They can tell just by face that I'm stressed but I suppose it's just human nature to just keep pushing someone.

The pushing causes me to withdraw even more."
110ky7o,"This is something I find so frustrating - all of the changes, all of the cutting back, all of the trying to live as healthy as possible and to still feel like shit so often."
110ky7o,"I feel like a total useless lump of shit, it sucks I wish I could go back to being normal a period each month instead of this shit. At least with periods u only felt like crap the week before u were due on now I feel like crap everyday!"
110ky7o,I feel ya it's been over a year for me and I'm on the Combipatch and it'not helping me with my anxiety of course it's only been three weeks.I don't drink alcohol and no caffeine but I do eat a little sugar on the weekends.One thing about post menopause I do like is I am standing up for myself more and taking time out for myself.
110ky7o,I take one magnesium just before bed it's suppose to relax you but I couldn't say either way if it works or not.
110ky7o,"I‚Äôve found that the less people I‚Äôm around, the better my life is"
110ky7o,That makes sense.
110ky7o,Who needs a doctor to confirm it when we are living it.
110ky7o,We all are x
110ky7o,"Lol I feel like that too but also wished I didn't have this cat, worse mistake of my life getting it!"
110ky7o,"I no-showed to a Superbowl party last night. I told my husband and son I'd meet them there. I was exhausted so I took a nap and then when I woke up I was not looking forward to the small talk and suffering through a game I had no interest in, so I stayed home knowing my husband would be irritated. It was totally worth it though! I think part of me knew there was a chance I'd no-show but I didn't want my husband guilting me into going or it turning into an argument."
110ky7o,Thank you! I love hearing this--there's hope yet!
110ky7o,That sounds like heaven!
110ky7o,That sounds just perfect! Good luck to you both.
110ky7o,It's been weeks and maybe months for me.
110ky7o,"Thank you. This. I‚Äôve had my darkest moments this time of year. One year, I entertained jumping in front of a train.  

I‚Äôm overwhelmed rn."
110ky7o,"Not at the moment but I'm looking into it. I spoke to my doctor about 6 months ago and was prescribed antidepressants, no mention of the menopause.

It was only when I found this sub that things started to click for me."
110ky7o,"I have my 4 year old granddaughter living with me, she's adorable and I love her energy and inquisitiveness but damn sometimes I'm just exhausted and wonder when my time will come."
110ky7o,"This perfectly sums it up for me, not wanting to talk because I have nothing to say, I just can't be bothered.

 My mother wittered on and on about absolutely nothing and it drove me insane."
110ky7o,With you
110ky7o,"This is me.  I promised myself this morning at 4am as I lay in bed wishing I could sleep, that I would start a 'fake it until I make it"" lifestyle plan for now.  

I don't feel like working, or cleaning, or doing a damn thing.  Leaving the house seems daunting."
110ky7o,Same same
110ky7o,"Thats want I am doing this December...taking a week, by myself to Florida!"
110ky7o,"This seems like a great idea.  I turn 50 this summer and have been struggling to think of what to do for it.  Mostly because I want to do nothing, by myself."
110ky7o,"Thank you very Much! I'm here all week!

This would also make a great cross-stitch!"
110ky7o,"The week before menstruation is usually pretty clam likely. That‚Äôs harder to track now that I don‚Äôt have a uterus and the ovulation hormones are out of wack. Even though I had the hysterectomy, I kept my period reminders turned on just so I can see on the calendar when I should be at that point in the cycle. But more and more the cycle just isn‚Äôt stable."
110ky7o,"I am really struggling maintaining relationships. The last 10 months have been an absolute nightmare. Right now I am just trying to heal. And I am one of those animals that like to hide their wounds. 

Still trying to get my meds stabilized but just when I start to feel like I am getting better, shit just falls apart. Hopefully one day things will get better."
110ky7o,"THIS!!!  I'm so relieved to hear that so many other women have similar feelings ... sometimes it's so awful, üòû 
nothing helps, and I wonder if this is going to get worse as my hormones continue to plummet?!  I know that I can't deal with that! ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
110ky7o,Same here..
110ky7o,Thank you for this comment! I totally feel this too!
110ky7o,I love you comment.  I have a cat who we've had for 6 years.  All of a sudden I wish it didn't exist.  I think I just hate everything right now.
110ky7o,"I was online A LOT looking for help when I was feeling the worst of the symptoms. I feel like for a few years I *became* my symptoms. 

I have to be honest and say I didn't get much help from my doctor. I didn't get much help from forums or subb-Reddits, either, but I *DID* feel like just having somewhere to share what I was going through with other women was absolutely invaluable.

Just want other menopausal women to know that relief *does* come. It's a different journey for all of us, but it does having a stopping point.

There's no wrong way to go through it. HRT, no HRT. Doesn't matter. Just use this time to dig deep and cut out the bullshit in your life. It's almost like someone rips the band-aid off. Things and people show their true value during this rough patch. Use that information to make the next chapter of your life *better.*"
110ky7o,"Yes! Sometimes you have to- you won‚Äôt feel better unless all the shit in the house is done but you don‚Äôt want to do it. It helps, just make sure you aren‚Äôt faking it too much that you deny your true feelings. Get help if it is really bad and lasts for a super long time."
110ky7o,"I had to go on HRT as I would have topped myself otherwise, I never knew menopause can make u feel like you've lost your mind. I would have been locked up in the olden days for hysteria if it wasn't for HRT, those poor women didn't even know it was their hormones, so fkn sad the shit cards we get played."
110tq1b,"In peri, sometimes two eggs are released, one after another. I don‚Äôt know if what you describe is that, because my understanding is that this situation causes periods about 2 weeks apart and not one right after another. 

It may very well be perimenopause, but you should alway get any period over 7 days checked out by a doctor. You‚Äôll feel better once you do, as it won‚Äôt be a mystery situation any more."
110tq1b,Mine was twice a month near the end.  One lasted 6 weeks. Doctor said was normal peri stuff
110tq1b,"Hi, I'm at day 13 here and on my anxiety meds to try keep the panic attacks at bay! Typical I've had to wait the weekend before I can get to the Drs (put a consult form Friday but I'm gong to contact them again today!)
Very similar to you -nearly 46, cycles reduced to approx 23 days for the past year(/s) but the last one -1st Feb I thought lasted the usual 5 days then stopped for 2 then back on again.at the same time last week I had severe back pain from my 35kg dog crashing into me, which has improved and pretty much better now but I've convinced myself it's all related to something bad :("
110tq1b,"I‚Äôm definitely going to get it checked. I‚Äôve put in an email to my care provider for some guidance. Thanks for your response. I‚Äôm so panicked. I have read that some people have had prolonged bleeding, but my mind goes worst case scenario. 
Hopefully this gets sorted soon."
110tq1b,"That helps! Thank you. I‚Äôm sorry you experienced that though, but helps to know it is in the realm of this perimenopause hell. This is such a wild ride. 
Six weeks!! I would lose it."
110tq1b,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre struggling too. It‚Äôs so hard to not worse care scenarios things. I am hoping I get an email soon. I emailed yesterday knowing it was the weekend, but I hope I get a response. I‚Äôm beyond worried. I hope both of us get calming news and this ends. 
I‚Äôm here to listen anytime."
110tq1b,"I‚Äôm not going to lie, your next 10 years are going to be a ride of new symptoms. Stay as healthy as you can + get checked out when needed - that‚Äôs all you can do."
110tq1b,"Trust me,  full menopause is far worse. It's hellish EVERY DAY. I'd take the monthly horror over this in a minute"
110tq1b,"Thanks so much, same, let's keep in touch!got my appointment later today..going to push for referral, though the bleeding is slowing to spotting for me now, but that's still not really reassuring me!"
110tq1b,"Oh no doubt. I have had perimenopause symptoms for quite some time now. Years even. This is just the first time with a long period, so it‚Äôs sent me over the edge. As of the anxiety, night sweats, exhaustion aren‚Äôt enough?!?"
110tq1b,"Ugh. I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm so over all this because it‚Äôs miserable. I hate it gets worse because this is hell so I can to even imagine what‚Äôs to come. 
Sending you good thoughts."
110tq1b,So the GP was not at all alarmed and said it's so common at our age range. She gave me external and internal exam and no obvious issues. I am booked in for pap smear but my last one was 3 years and clear and it can take decades for cells to turn? She said to watch and see and any more issues she will try to refer me but they wouldn't accept it at this stage because it's such a common symptom of peri..I do feel much better and reassured and going to put it out of my head for now --but I'm be going back at drop of a hat of there's anything else!!or maybe even if it starts again! (It does help that the bleeding has tailed off and stopped today) How are you doing?x
110tq1b,Thank you üòä  hugs for you
110tq1b,"So glad you had a good appointment! I‚Äôm still bleeding. It‚Äôs definitely not full force, but more like spotting. It slows then starts again. SO OVER THIS! I contacted my doctor and she said she was not concerned due to my last several paps being clear and given my age. I have my yearly appointment coming up in late March. 
I‚Äôm glad yours has stopped. I‚Äôm going insane and just got super emotional because I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of all this. 
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing better!! Thank you for updating me. I was just coming to check."
110tq1b,Much appreciated! :)
110tq1b,Aw I'm glad you were given similar reassurances and your Dr was also not alarmed.my GP confirmed it's a common complaint in her patients our age. & I guess we are doing everything we should rather than ignore it. I think you're a few days behind me at day 10/11? I bled 14 days and apparently that's not unusual (minus 2 non bleeding- which was the bit that most alarmed me tbh! So I'm also kind of reassured that yours seems stopping/starting.) Not sure what I will do if it starts up again!crap myself probably. I was practically holding my breath and trying not to exert myself when it seemed to tail off but it gradually did over a few days and has stopped for now! Hope yours ends similar to mine soon!x
113h3pn,"I did, I chose hysterectomy. Changed my life for the better. No more murder scenes or anemia. My mood improved as well."
113h3pn,Hysterectomy in 2015 and am so happy I did.
113h3pn,"Had a hysterectomy and regret it for a few reasons - bladder and bowel changes, figure changes, loss of uterine orgasms (other orgasms don't compare)."
113h3pn,"I have an IUD, booked in for hysterectomy in May. My fibroids have grown in size and my lower back is killing me. Not sure how old you are, but Im 55 and I can't wait to get rid of my uterus."
113h3pn,I had a partial hysterectomy in 2008. Best decision I ever made. No regrets whatsoever.
113h3pn,"If it were only uterine polyps, an IUD might be worth considering. Mine were removed through a Myosure procedure and I now take low dose birth control continuously. However, my understanding is that the definitive ""cure"" for adenomyosis is hysterectomy. Hugs to you and good luck with your decision."
113h3pn,I had a uterine ablation. Very happy with it.
113h3pn,"Hysterectomy was the best gift I ever gave myself. Every Woman I know who did the IUD, hated it for various reasons and had to have it removed or continued to have more issues and eventually needed a hysterectomy anyways. I'm not sure why Dr's promote them, they seem to work for only a very small handful of issues. My Sister swears it made her hair fall out. She kept it for 8wks before giving up and having it taken out."
113h3pn,Same.
10lri0e,Get your thyroid checked as this mimics symptoms of menopause.
10lri0e,"I think you are doing the right things. 
Is a good idea to get changes checked out by a doctor.  I think you are quite right that it would be helpful to keep a diary of your symptoms. 
What you describe could well be the first signs of peri. Things i noticed but didn't connect included: new allergies, dying skin and eyes (I struggled with my contract lenses), my hair thinning (I had noticed more of it coming out) , night sweats, disrupted sleep and brain fog ... I had terrible trouble finding the right words for things.  I also noticed it was starting to get difficult to get to a toilet in time to pee. 
I was in my mid 30s and it was quite an emotional thing to come to terms with what was happening to me.  It felt like a symbol of me getting older.  I also had to adjust to the idea of not betting a mother.  I thought at the time it was only being so sleep deprived and struggling with the other symptoms that was making me so down,  but looking back the idea of menopause itself was pretty tough.  If you feel depressed I think that's perfectly natural.i don't think it means you need treatment for depression,  not necessarily,  I'm sorry this is happening to you,  and I hope you can have some time for yourself."
10lri0e,"44 here and I know how you feel.  I have gotten to the point where I only know I am Peri because of three symptoms, age, certain hormone levels and shortened heavy periods.  GYN did nothing except say it could be but I cannot confirm and sent me back to see my Endocrinologist to get my thyroid checked again.  My thyroid disorder shares 75% of the symptoms as Peri.  

Long story short:  I started taking estrogen and low libido supplements to help with low sex drive (estrogen was really low last blood test) and my husband has been really understanding now that he knows what is going on."
10lri0e,"Just want to mention, some antidepressants do the same thing, so if you are on anything like that might be worth checking into."
10lri0e,"TLDR: premature perimenopause diagnosis in 30‚Äôs was actually effects of anxiety and SSRI side effects. 

Diagnosed premature peri menopause in my late 30s due to multiple symptoms and hormone levels. Really symptoms were caused by anxiety. Took several specialists to figure it out, and only because I happened to really stressed at an appointment. By then I also had hypertension from the hormones and the doctor wanted me to start blood pressure meds. Got rid of the hormones and hypertension went away. Treated the anxiety and menopause symptoms went away. 

Also SSRI‚Äôs and SSRNI‚Äôs cause me to be hot, overheat in the summer, not able to wear a coat when it is well below freezing in the winter.  Sweating when no one else is. The overheating problem got worse over time.  Two decades later still periods are still regular and only a few menopause symptoms starting."
10lri0e,"Hey there & welcome! I started having peri symptoms at 30 & Im 42 still waiting to begin missing periods. Not on HRT or any of that & basically just recently found out what was going on. 

You're gonna have all kinds of symptoms & they may be similar to other women or they may just only affect you. Severity is another thing; I don't experience many hot flashes anymore bcuz of dietary changes but many of us suffer from them all day long, several times an hour even.  The depressed feeling is a symptom; I woke up yesterday feeling the same way but today I'm fine. 

You are definitely not alone & Im glad you found your way here. I often feel better after I've spent some time here & I'm learning something every day, literally. I then pass that onto my husband bcuz we both have no clue lol 

Just know you will be okay & you don't have to suffer with your symptoms! Like ever. Come back & talk to us :)"
10lri0e,"This is pretty much exactly how it started for me at 35. A few years later I was diagnosed hypothyroid and also have some adrenal/cortisol problems after working night shift for several years. I also had a decrease in libido and some increased anxiety and depression at the time. 
I take black cohosh supplement now (natures way brand) and hardly have any night sweats now. Bonus is it also helps a lot with my mood. It took a week or two to really kick in."
10lri0e,"Hi ya, hey I'm 48 I  didn't know about peri either until my periods started skipping and my friend mentioned peri. Of course I'd heard of menopause but I thought that was a few years off yet. The main thing is you have had a few symptoms and you are looking into it. You have an appointment and you have done the right thing for yourself. Hang in there you are young and may need to eliminate illness before peri. X"
10lri0e,"I'm in perimenopause at 36. It's early, but not unheard of. I have low estrogen and testosterone. My periods have been gradually spacing out. They were always regular, 28-29 day cycles and slowly started spacing out to 32 days, 36 days, etc. and my periods became lighter and shorter. I have almost no libido and haven't for a while, depression and mood swings, night sweats, mild hot flashes, and weight gain in my belly. Doctor only offered birth control pills, which helped at first, but now I'm feeling side effects and want to allow my body to go through this process naturally, hence the Reddit scrolling lol. So far, from podcasts and articles, I'm thinking I need to add calcium to my supplements and try maca, flax, and more soy. I already take magnesium and and vitamin D, which help a lot. Best of luck on your health journey. I hope you figure it out, perimenopause or not."
10lri0e,"I recall starting to notice changes around age 35. I was heavily into exercise and my symptoms were minimal. Periods gradually decreased in strength to age 42. Thought I was done, got a period, and next thing you know. I was pregnant. Had a daughter at 43. Wild hormonal ride. Post part um depression.  On top of already doctoring for major depression. 

Back to peri, BUT I was so busy focusing on depression,  trying so many drugs the side effects of which overlap peri that I didn't realize I was doing ""double duty"". I am now 64 and burned out. 

To arm yourself with the education that I wish I had, look at the book: Menopause Your Management Your Way by Dr. Barbara Taylor. 

EVERYTHING about menopause,  every stage, and options for self-care and disease prevention. 
She is also on YouTube,  under Menopause Barbie. 
We have got your back here!!"
10lri0e,Thank you! I will!
10lri0e,"I am on something, but I‚Äôve been on it for almost one year, and the night sweats are very very recent..:/.."
10lri0e,My god that sounds terrible :/ I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. I'd have lost my fucking mind.
10lri0e,"You should tell her about the mint body wash, Jackfruit ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
10lri0e,"Thank you, this is very detailed and very helpful."
10lri0e,Still could be it.  Especially if it‚Äôs Paxil

10dyfzq,"Not me, but I had a friend who was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and coffee was one of the foods/drinks she had to eliminate, along with alcohol and a few other foods. The symptoms you describe sound similar to the ones she had prior to her diagnosis, i.e. pain and urgency, similar to a UTI.  She was diagnosed in her early forties, but I don't know if there was a link to perimenopause.  If you Google the disorder you can find more information.  It also took a long time to reach a diagnosis- like you she was treated for UTIs and never got better."
10dyfzq,"Yup too much caffeine does this to me as well.(2 or more servings after 2 days in a row). Also it aggravates my asthma and I end up having a coughing fit. Sugar does too (coughing) to some extent. I've asked my doctor, she has no answers.

 She's a great doctor but young, she said she's been reading up on peri and menopause because of me, so yay she's trying.

Oh and if I get too hot, coughing fit. Yes I have an inhaler, just pisses me off. 

I hate this."
10dyfzq,"Oh dear. I have Interstitial Cystitis and that sure sounds like a classic case. Stimulants are not your friend.

Are you taking any dermal or oral estrogen? Because I will say estrogen helped a great deal with IC urgency and pain. I can at least have some decaf once in a while now, and coffee was one of my favorite things in the world. I have adjusted to life without it, though. I've had IC for over a decade and half now and other women in my family have it too."
10dyfzq,"Unrelated to menopause, genetically some folks are slow absorbers of caffeine, so the caffeine stays longer in their bodies. The result is that caffeine has negative effects for them. Other folks process caffeine reasonably fast, and caffeine has positive effects on their body. Some genealogy DNA testing services can tell you what caffeine processing gene you have."
10dyfzq,"The perimenopausal women can not tolerate caffeine is probably more about it making hot flashes and insomnia worse, which it can.

Hormones, whether one is having hormone surges in peri or taking HRT, will definitely affect caffeine tolerance in terms of how fast the body detoxifies it, because in the pre-menopausal years this would change depending on where one was in their cycle, I'm not just making this up, it's been studied in pre-menopausal women anyway.

There is nothing wrong with trying vaginal estrogen for the urinary issues."
10dyfzq,"Have you tried Prelief? Over the counter, takes acid away from food and drink. I've been able to drink cola and coffee again. Before, I would have hours of terrible urinary urgency after drinking caffeine."
10dyfzq,"I'm not sharing these symptoms, but the prospect of developing them is frightening, Coca Cola is one of my comfort drinks üíÄ"
10dyfzq,"I achieved ""official"" menopause last month. Probably two years ago I stopped being able to handle caffeine at all and particularly coffee. Coffee is surprisingly acidic! I also have difficulty with tomato and citrus, when paired with a fat like cream or cheese it's much worse.

Sometimes I kiss my husband in the morning and yes I do love him but also he tastes like coffee, delicious coffee, forbidden coffee."
10dyfzq,"Yep had to quit caffeine, or full caff, but for migraines. Which are also menopausal symptom for me. But caffeine also gives me anger issues so it's just best for everyone if I don't have it. It's hard because now if I sit down I get sleepy. Sleepy all the time! ü§¶"
10dyfzq,"Targeted estrogen cream would likely ease your urge incontinence. I can drink decaf, at least now!"
10dyfzq,"I had this. Always felt like I needed to pee. But I drank a LOT of coffee. My husband would make a morning pot, fill his travel mug to head to work, and I'd finish the pot...mainly just cuz it was there. Anyway, I stopped drinking coffee and switched to 2 cups of English Breakfast tea every morning with a little honey and some almond milk and it cleared up. It improved my hydration, as well."
10dyfzq,"Yes! I‚Äôve done tons of research on IC, and I am certain I have it. But, again, it‚Äôs impossible to get diagnosed."
10dyfzq,"Oh, when I get warm my fingers and feet swell. Like to embarrassing proportions. So, that‚Äôs fun too. You‚Äôve got this, friend."
10dyfzq,"Ah, yes! I‚Äôm certain I have IC too. I do not take any estrogen. I‚Äôve been chasing on DHEA. May I ask what you take?"
10dyfzq,"That‚Äôs a helpful idea. I was a huge fan of caffeine for so long, but it just changed almost overnight. I‚Äôll check my 23 and me for the caffeine processing gene. Thanks!"
10dyfzq,I‚Äôm going to give that a try! Thank you!
10dyfzq,"THIS IS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! Even if it doesn‚Äôt work for me, it‚Äôs that glimmer of hope I was looking for. THANK YOU!"
10dyfzq,They make caffeine free coke! I used to drink it when I was pregnant
10dyfzq,"Oh I learned early on I couldn't tolerate coke (long before peri/meno), the urinary pain was too bad, it's been probably a couple decades since I had one.  Instant pain is kind of all the feedback I need.  I might have IC but it wasn't a very visible case, one of those your bladder looks pretty normal things."
10dyfzq,Me too. üôÉ
10dyfzq,"Oh, yes. Even the smell of coffee brings me great pleasure. I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt have any either!"
10dyfzq,I feel like a zombie all the time. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs a cute look with these half closed eyes.
10dyfzq,Even tea tears me up. That‚Äôs why I assumed it was the caffeine that bothered me. I‚Äôve been using herbal only for a few years and it‚Äôs just not the same.
10dyfzq,YES! I was disappointed not a single dr suggested cutting our caffeine after 2 bladder slings and a symphony of medications.
10dyfzq,Right! It's just not the same.
10jvn0m,"I still suffer from acne but I found a few things that really help control it

Cinnamon capsules - helps with controlling your blood sugar which seems to help prevent sugar spikes and acne breakouts, at least for me

DHT blocker - This has been a miracle cure for me. I used to break out regularly ever since taking this I rarely break out now. If I do it's maybe once a month or so. I use Foliform.

Azelaic acid  serum - This helps also prevent breakouts

A prebiotic/probiotic supplement - there's a strong connection between gut health and skin health and for some reason taking the supplement seems to help keep acne at bay"
10jvn0m,"Have you tried to (bravely for many) stop wearing any & all makeup? Have you ever tried skipping any & all cleansers on your face? Hear me out‚Ä¶

When Covid started, i decided to save my makeup (and money!) for when life returned to normal & it wouldn‚Äôt be wasted under, or get rubbed off from, wearing masks. Also, around that same month, I watched some random medical documentary that discussed pH balance and how even the gentlest cleansers can ruin it & piss off your skin. So in addition to skipping makeup, I also used water ONLY to clean my face every day‚Ä¶
My cystic acne on my face has completely stopped. And I don‚Äôt miss a thing about my previous life!"
10jvn0m,"What help has your GP been? Mine put me on retin-a and a steroid- the steroid is for the immediate break out that is painful, and retin-a is to help reduce over the long hall. We did this 10 years ago and it did help, although somewhere in there I did see a dermatologist who put me on spironolactone. 

(bonus, retin-a works on wrinkles)"
10jvn0m,Ugh I feel your pain totally. I had the WORST cystic acne about 6 months after I went into surgical menopause and it was so awful and caused me more shame than any other issues. I spent a fortune on skin treatments and specialised products that did nothing and I knew it was hormonal by nature. I also don‚Äôt wear makeup so it absolutely wasn‚Äôt that. What fixed it absolutely - as in one month to the day I had zero spots - was spirinolactone which is bizarrely a diuretic sometimes prescribed for blood pressure. Obviously needs to be prescribed by your doctor but mine was happy to. Only thing to make sure of is that you have plenty of liquid so you don‚Äôt get dehydrated. But it worked for me.
10jvn0m,"I had cystic acne as a kid. IT was so bad that I had dry ice and radiation treatments for it. 

All these years later, my skin is smooth and I only with warm water 2x a day."
10jvn0m,"Are you sure it is cystic acne, could it be rosacea ?"
10jvn0m,"Have you tried adapalene gel, such as Differin? It‚Äôs over the counter in the USA. By prescription in other places. It‚Äôs in the retinol family, is more gentle, generally cheaper and designed specifically for acne. Other than that, ensuring your basic routine is free of added perfume ingredients may help. Cerave or Cetaphil brands are good for this. At night, gentle oil-based cleanser at night if you wear makeup, followed something like a Cerave foaming cleanser. Then adapalene gel. Then a mild face cream, such as  Cerave moisturizer. In the morning, rinse face with water only, followed by a mild moisturizer and sunblock. I use Beauty of Joseon (a Japanese sunblock, which I order through Stylevana) and also Super Goop Unseen (quite expensive, available at Sephora, but super lovely). Be careful with sunscreens, I‚Äôve gotten contact dermatitis with some more highly perfumed versions, which went away within a few days of stopping using that particular version."
10jvn0m,"I think a routine and trying to use as few products as possible is likely the best approach to attaining and maintaining good skin health.  Good, consistent nutrition and sleep are helpful. (What is this sleep I just mentioned? üòÇ)

Just to share, and please forgive me if this feels like I‚Äôm hijacking your post, I could never figure out what caused my issues except clearly genetics.  But I have/had all kinds of skin issues, psoriasis, cystic acne, eczema, and occasionally hives.  My skin does not heal like those without psoriasis due to Koebner phenomenon.  I‚Äôve taken courses of accutane twice, when I was younger in my 30‚Äôs, and I still occasionally have acne flare ups.  So!  I have noticed that when I‚Äôm in warm and sunny environments and drink tons of water and don‚Äôt wear any makeup (I have to wear sunscreen bc I‚Äôm at risk for skin cancer-significantly) that I tend to have a better complexion. I have taken spironolactone to help, but man I think that‚Äôs what caused my body to stop making testosterone, so I don‚Äôt take that anymore.  I‚Äôve tried cutting sugar (I don‚Äôt eat much anyway) and gluten (genetically I‚Äôm at a slight risk for celiac disease) and nightshade plants (tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes because they can be triggers for psoriasis).  

Think I‚Äôm going to try Tazorac topical again, but it‚Äôs got some gnarly possible side effects.  I‚Äôm also going to try some probiotics again.  I already drink a lot of water.  

Let us know what ends up working best for you!  Everyone is different so maybe something you the will help others, too!"
10jvn0m,Accutane finally worked for me. It‚Äôs a last resort.
10jvn0m,"It‚Äôs just not fair, is it.  Dammit, me too except I have insurance. 

My derm still recommends Retin-a, so OTC with retinol couldn‚Äôt hurt. Apparently it‚Äôs hard to get insurance coverage at our age because so many want it for cosmetic /anti wrinkle purposes. 

My derm also recommends an antibiotic to prevent spreading (I have clindamysin). New to me, but actually works and doesn‚Äôt dry my skin out like the Sahara. So if you could find a light creamy OTC antibiotic it couldn‚Äôt hurt."
10jvn0m,"I don't have experience. But from reading on some skin forums, adapalene gel (OTC/no Rx needed) oftentimes works. Another option is spironolactone (Rx needed)."
10jvn0m,What is your current skincare routine?
10jvn0m,"My acne is nearly gone after I cut back on dairy. Nothing else worked. I have rosacea but rarely break out now, maybe one a month (when I actually cycle)."
10jvn0m,Thank you :) Those are some things I haven't tried.
10jvn0m,Yes believe it or not I wear very little makeup and tried this route at the suggestion of a co-worker. She's French and only washes her face with water. It didn't help unfortunately but I do only use a really milk cleanser Cetaphil and moisturizer on my face. I'm so glad your acne stopped!!! :)
10jvn0m,I did try the spironolactone but didn't see any improvement. My GP acts annoyed with me when I mention acne like I just need to get over it. Last time she told me to try Differin (which I have) and that was it :( Haven't tried retin-a yet!
10jvn0m,Yes I did try to the spironolactone but it didn't work for me :( I'm so glad you have had success though! :)
10jvn0m,I don't think so as they are puffy acne with whiteheads sometimes :(
10jvn0m,"Yes I have tried Differin, wear very little makeup if any on my face and use Cetaphil regularly. This makes me think it's got a hormonal component :( Thank you for the suggestions though! :)"
10jvn0m,Thank you :)
10jvn0m,"Nearly 53 here and still get acne without spironolactone! The good news is that it works great, no side effects, and it‚Äôs cheap - shop around - I pay around $10/month without insurance (it‚Äôs more expensive thru my insurance, which is why you need to shop around)."
10jvn0m,I wear very little (if any) makeup and wash with Cetaphil and use a light Cetaphil moisturizer.
10jvn0m,"Here are links to some of the products I use that I find to be very helpful

10jvn0m,Oh no! I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt work for you. I wrote above that it‚Äôs the only thing that does work for me.
10jvn0m,"Rosacea can look like inflamed white heads, often mistaken as cystic acne."
10jvn0m,Thank you :)
10jvn0m,Now I definitely want to see a dermatologist. Maybe it's not acne at all?
10u0gny,"She sounds wrong on many things.

1) no need to take birth control if HRT works for symptoms (sometimes worth trying if low risk and if HRT really isn't working)

2) it is true you don't need progesterone to protect your uterus if you don't have one.  The pill has synthetic progesterone.

3) I don't know where she is getting that cyclical increases cancer risk and continuous doesn't.  I don't know that there is any evidence of that.  It is true there may be a higher cancer risk with progrestrone + estrogen than just with estrogen.

4) it is unlikely your symptoms last the rest of your life, for at least 75% of women they don't, this still leaves some women who have symptoms for decades, but odds are they end."
10u0gny,Okay just reading that sent HUGE red flags up.  Is she trying to scare you?  I would be asking for a second opinion plus in depth hormone tests.  But I seem to become a little pushy lately when it comes to doctors and having my mind settled that all bases have been covered.
10u0gny,"The PROGESTIN (synthetic progesterone) is, I believe, what had an increased cancer risk, not prometrium/utrogestan. Progestin is what‚Äôs in the birth control pill (bcp also has synthetic estrogen, not estradiol).  

I‚Äôm so, so sorry the ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù was another waste of time and money and a new source of agitation. 

Fwiw, when I briefly looked at the gel, the conversion I found for my patch dose (0.1) was 3-4 pumps, depending on which site I looked at. As I‚Äôm essentially cash-pay for rx‚Äôs, that was untenable and I never tried it. 

Also, I definitely have done better on 100mg vaginally than I did in higher doses of progesterone. 

I think I suggested it before, but I have been VERY happy with Intuniv (it‚Äôs marketed as ADHD pill but NON stimulant, been around for ages as blood pressure reducer, CHEAP). I gave it a try because Yale neurologists are using in Covid brain fog. Has helped my sleep immensely! More than every drug/supplement I‚Äôve tried. I did have about a week of getting used to it - taken at night because it‚Äôs sedating (üéâ), but I had some morning grogginess for about a week.  Make sure you get the extended release version (still cheap!)."
10u0gny,That‚Äôs terrible.   I would recommend finding a good gynecologist and getting another viewpoint.
10u0gny,"I'm always confused as to how women think menopause will magically ""get better.""  It's not temporary; it's permanent.  Once those hormones are gone, they're not coming back!  This is your new normal."
10u0gny,Thank you! I hope she was wrong. I couldnt find any good data to support what she said either.
10u0gny,Thank you for this. I feel all shaken up. I will definitely search for a second opinion.
10u0gny,"Thank you very much! So there is more estrogen in patches than in the gel? That is interesting.

Yes, that was not only a waste of money but the reverse of helpful. How much I throw at snake oil sellers! I would much rather have a happy life and travel with it.

As regards intuniv, there is no way I can get adhd meds here without adhd and even then it‚Äôs hard. But thank you!"
10u0gny,"I will, thank you, it is really horrible to be scared like this"
10u0gny,"Well. Because many older women tell me it does. At least some of the symptoms seem to go away.

If this is my new normal‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt go on with this intense anxiety. Waking up every night is bad enough. Waking up every night to hours of intense dread and fear is not sustainable."
10u0gny,"Hello Wishesandhope, I think I remember, unless I have you confused with someone else, your situation was an unusual one (as in they don't do that anymore most places) in which they left the crevix in after a hysterectomy?  If so you might need progesterone for that as it's part of the uterus (I don't want to give medical advice), but everything else I said applies."
10u0gny,Was this at a menopause specialty clinic? Is there another doctor there to speak to?
10u0gny,"I‚Äôm on the highest dose patch (0.1). I believe one pump of gel was ROUGHLY equivalent to 0.03 of a patch. 

I hear you on Intuniv. I wa slickly to have an NP willing to try based on the Yale brain fog article I sent her."
10u0gny,And also if you‚Äôre over 50 you might have another 50 years of anything üòÇ.   But seriously seek a different doctor.  Those private clinics might have agendas to sell you specific medications.    Find a doctor or gynecologist who tells you your options without making it scary.  You have options for treatment and deserve to find something that is both safe and effective and there are doctors who will support you.   Not easy to find but that one you saw is dreadful.
10u0gny,So it's denial and wishful thinking.  Got it.
10u0gny,You remember right. That‚Äôs what I thought as well. The dose may be too high but I think she was off on many things and I am appalled that she is a menopause specialist charging high rates for her expertise with this kind of advice.
10u0gny,No it was an online consultation. And yes I will speak to another doctor most definitely- hopefully I will find one who is better than that
10u0gny,"She didn‚Äôt try to sell anything but it was certainly scary yes.

I don‚Äôt know how much time I have, hopefully many decades and if the youth treatment comes, lol, who knows. However much, I want the time to be good! I spent so much of my life, worried, depressed, stressed, living for others. I want to live well now, be happy, do what I think is right, help and support others and be supported, see the world, laugh hard. And this awful ‚Äúalways wake up between 2 and 3am slightly sweaty and in fear‚Äù makes it impossibl!

So I do all sorts of stuff and some are helpful‚Ä¶.and some a lot less so."
10u0gny,"This is a honest question. Why are you being so harsh to me?

I am suffering badly here. Of course I have wishful thinking! It would help how if I tell myself ‚Äûthat‚Äôs how it‚Äôs going to stay‚Äú?"
10vdr00,If you have a uterus you should take the progesterone‚Äî it‚Äôs protective so that your uterine lining doesn‚Äôt get too thick on just estrogen. (As far as I understand.)
10vdr00,Yes. Here is more info on the /subreddit wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/wiki/index
10vdr00,"I‚Äôm guessing you meant .5 mg? I am taking 1 mg. I started on .5 oral for one month and that dose didn‚Äôt help with a lot of my symptoms. 
Dr. bumped it up to 1 mg oral and now I feel great. Im also taking progesterone 1x a day and applying vaginal estrogen cream at a maintenance dose of 2x a week."
10vdr00,Thank you all.  I will talk to my Doctor about adding progesterone.  I've been taking estradiol for about 2 years with zero symptom relief üò©
10vdr00,"I've heard that it's not good to take estradiol orally.  Get a patch, cream or injection"
10vdr00,‚Ä¶ which ultimately protects against uterine cancer.
10vdr00,You're are right.  .5 mg.
10vdr00,"What are your symptoms? If it‚Äôs vaginal pain, itching, dryness etc, I‚Äôve found estrogen inserts work better than the oral version."
10vdr00,"If you need symptom support, keep in mind the gold standard is the transdermal form of estradiol (patches or gel you rub onto your skin), combined with a micronized progesterone pill (prometrium, utrogestan or generics). You may want to switch the these forms, and also request a screening for uterine cancer. Best of luck!"
10vdr00,"To be clear...oral estradiol carries slight higher risks, but some folks tolerate tablets better than transdermal methods, so it's important to weigh those risks vs. benefits.  We are all different and have to each find a method of delivery that works best for us."
10vdr00,The patch would not stay on my body!
10vdr00,"Nah. It's fine to take orally. My doctor prefers it. She thinks it's often better than the patch, which can be a real pain in the ass and also may not really absorb that well for a lot of women."
10vdr00,"The risk with taking oral estrogen is increased chance of blood clots. But keep in mind millions of women take the pill for birth control for years, without developing clots."
10vdr00,"I was going to say -- where are you getting 5 mg tablets?!!! If they were offered, I'd like to take them, lol."
10vdr00,"It's fine to take orally. You may have a very slightly higher chance of certain side effects, but they are the same you would have with oral BC. Low chance of any real problems. The patch seems like a nightmare."

10r9qb7,[Atrophic vaginitis \(atrophy\) or the genitourinary syndrome of menopause \(GSM\)](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_what_about_that_vaginal_dryness_and_shrinkage.3F) is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause
10r9qb7,The feeling of having an uti without actually having a uti can be from a lot of things. Interstitial cystitis is one. Weak pelvic floor is another. Constipation. I struggle with irritated bladder all the time. My doctor prescribed oxybutinin for bladder spasms that works. It‚Äôs such a pain to deal with. I was recently prescribed vaginal estrogen which has helped me but I still get an irritated bladder. The vaginal cream didn‚Äôt irritate my vagina at all.
10r9qb7,I have interstitial cystitis and this is how I feel during flares. It‚Äôs a diagnosis of elimination so try the diet which you can find online for free and see cause why not.
10r9qb7,It could be a hypertonic pelvic floor. I suffer from this.
10r9qb7,Hey babe!! I was exactly the same as you and now cured..the vaginal estrogen you use needs to be increased from 3 x per wk to once daily for 2 wks. It will work and then you just use it 3 x per wk again. Your lady garden just needs a little boost. Check with your doc or Google vaginal atrophy to confirm.  Good luck üëç
10r9qb7,"Yes, this is a key (horrible, awful) symptom of vaginal atrophy. DHEA oil is what cured mine, but vaginal estrogen is the gold standard."
10r9qb7,"Although I haven‚Äôt done anything about it in the Drs office, I often find myself wondering if I‚Äôm starting a UTI. I get that first pang, and a weaker urine stream, but it never goes anywhere behind that. Yet another symptom on the pile."
10r9qb7,"When that happens I use my vaginal estrogen daily for a week and it always fixes things. If you have vaginal estrogen cream in addition to the suppositories, put the cream on all of your soft tissues from clitoris to vaginal opening and back along your perineum. 

I like the vagifem pill inserts too, but my external tissue just needs more than that so I have the cream prescription as well. And when those UTI feelings come that's my sign to use the cream daily for a short stretch as those tissues are clearly in need of some help."
10r9qb7,"I had this problem for a couple of years. I thought it was one endless UTI. After so much misery, I discovered I needed estrogen cream (through my own research). I told my gyn to give me a script. That helped until recently. That old UTI burning pain returend. I started using Vmagic and Vulvacare internally. It's buckthorn oil that makes all the difference. It fixed everything. I use it every day now just in case. The Vulvacare is less expensive and not as leaky."
10r9qb7,You may want to try Replens.
10r9qb7,"I get these every so often the have to pee all the time, burning, achy, itchy, but no UTI, when I seen a doctor found out it was my Bartholin's glands, they can get blocked and kinda mimic a UTI, cause we'll there blocked and annoyed and irritated, asked a health care person to check them, sitz baths help along with lots of water and the waiting game for them to stop being irritated, not sure if this is what is happening with you, but check them out online and ask, see if it's those glands"
10r9qb7,"I had this for years before I figured out it was my IUD (the kind with localized progesterone). 

After about 6 months no IUD, it went away.  I‚Äôd still get it cyclically (monthly or so)

Starting estrogen essentially made it go away entirely.  It‚Äôs been over 2 years so my last UTI and I *knew* that was the real deal, no question."
10r9qb7,"How long after you eat foods that trigger you do you feel the affects? For example, I eat tomatoes probably 3 times a week. Is the effect cumulative or should I feel it immediately. I also drink 2-3 cups of coffee per day."
10r9qb7,What brand do you purchase?  Is it over the counter?  I have found a few but they all have coconut oil and I am allergic.
10r9qb7,Bit of both. Sometimes it‚Äôs damn near instant if I‚Äôm dehydrated at all.
10r9qb7,It's over the counter (I buy it on Amazon: BHRT is the brand) but it is unfortunately coconut oil based :-(
10r9qb7,Thanks anyway.
10r9qb7,I‚Äôm about to order this. I‚Äôm desperate for relief from this.
10qfg04,"I don't have eczema, but a had a extremely stressful month that must've shot my cortisol levels through the roof. I believe it may have kicked off for me different skin issues. Thise skin issues triggered extreme health anxiety that has turned me into a mess. So yes, I believe it entirely possible and would love to compare more stories on perimenopause/stress and the effect on skin."
10qfg04,"I've had eczema since my teens and it did get worse with peri. My cortisol levels have shot up as well. For me, I don't see the connection like you do. Instead I get panic attacks if I don't watch my coffee intake carefully (I refuse to give it up entirely - especially since it's my drug of choice because peri has made alcohol intolerable).

For the eczema, I've seen improvement with discontinuing hyaluronic acid and upping my plant variety. (I found a practice where you try to eat at least 30 different plants per week, grains included).

So, for me, I think it is more of a gut-skin connection. But, maybe since your gut health affects almost everything, the gut health is also affecting the cortisol levels. Maybe if I hadn't focused on gut health I wouldn't be able to drink coffee at all....so many factors to consider when muddling through peri."
10qfg04,"Yup. It was hideous and took over a year to clear up.. Pumpkin Seed Oil was really helpful. 

Avoid steroids. There is a poor woman on Ticktok whose life has been ruined by them..

Mine came on after a period of incredible stress. it was so bad I had to email the organisation being a massive pack of clowns Lawyer and let him know.."
10qfg04,"I used to get eczema on my fingers, but the last few years it‚Äôs totally cleared up. I am definitely more stressed than I used to be though."
10qfg04,"People on reddit hate when I write this but I'd look at your diet.

I had been suffering from eczema for decades (as long as I can remember) and it just got progressively worse as I got older.  It finally all came to a head when I started peri nearly 10yrs ago and my skin just wouldn't calm down.  I don't know if it the shifting hormones or what but I discovered that I am sensitive to gluten and that triggers/is the cause of my eczema.

I discovered this sensitivity when I was at my wits end and totally sick of it all; my skin was hurting, super irritated, red, dry af, the chronic dryness (peeling/gross/chapped lips, flakey/hypersensitive/itchy af skin etc) ...I""m sure you can relate to these symptoms.  Anyway, I was reading everything I could get my hands on and came across something that said gluten and dairy sensitivities can  manifest through the skin so I tried an elimination diet and discovered that it was anything made from wheat flour.  I have cut that out since 2012 and my eczema COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.  I was fucking FLOORED.  I know it's gluten because whenever I don't eat the way I normally eat (grain free), it all starts to come back.  It will go away again when I go back to my regular eating.

something to think about."
10qfg04,"Thank you. I do believe in the diet skin health correlation. I did try the eczema detox and cutting out said culprits, but found it did not really change anything for me (in fact, personally I got worse and also felt miserable as I could not even enjoy food no less life in general)

I do know some foods you would not think ‚Äî raw baby spibach ‚Äî do seem to trigger my itch and have begun to look into perhaps dietary and lifestyle boosts to regulate my cortisol. While not limiting myself to that, working off my hypothesis, it is something who I feel at this point can only benefit me /my organism.

I appreciate your comment and feel they are valid contribution. Thank you for taking the time and risk to do so."
10qfg04,"This is a possible fascinating connection to me. I never had eczema before a little over a year ago. I woke up one morning with my entire face looking like I had terrible plastic surgery. I ended up at an allergist within a couple days (they had a cancellation) and we thought it was an allergic reaction. Three weeks of prednisone helped but it flared up again right after the course was ended. Even ended up with a weaping sore on my cheek. Definitely not a fun experience. 

We did the allergy poke test. Nothing. Then they said maybe it was eczema. It has flared up twice since. I finally saw a dermatologist but by the time I got in the flare had reduced greatly but she assured me that now that I have had the first appointment, I can get in quicker next time. 

It's frustrating for sure. I know my skin has been getting drier the last couple of years and maybe this is another part of perimenopause for me. I just wish I could get a definitive answer so I understand where you are coming from in that regard."
10qfg04,"I feel quite certain that our increase in cortisol during these years of Change do impact us in so so many ways. Given how impactful cortisol is on us, I would love to propose this topic to a young one seeking thesis study ‚Äî would help so many of the population! Life stress sure as heck isn't in need hormonal change fertilizers! 

Thank you for your comment. Hopefully another will contribute something of interest to us both. Fairly convinced meditation/relaxation techniques need to be pursued in more earnest."
10qfg04,"It's all so vague and hypothetical. It is just on my reading that I felt both impact and react to elevated cortisol, especially as I am woken each night from irritation &/or in pain. I feel I am a bit grasping at straws, without direction or external help to get to the source/root at this point.

However, we certainly are whole organisms and I very much agree that there are other variables involved. Thank you so much for commenting  I will look in earnest more into microbiome gut health as well as liver detoxification & support. 
Sadly, I have had to cut out alcohol as I react immediately ‚Äî genetically, I have ALDH2 deficiency which now appears further weakened. As far as coffee goes, I have cut it out for some months now....but you give me hope that I may yet enjoy it again one day! I miss the flavour and would love the boost as these days I am falling asleep in my chair come mid- afternoon 

As far as eating more vegetables, I am on board! Though I am finding recommendations as to which are supportive a bit of a minefield with contradictory information out there. Would appreciate the share if you have a trusted reference you turn to.

Regarding hyaluronic acid, in what form were you taking/using this? I ask as recently I have begun taking tumeric for inflammation, with the added benefit of joint support. Perhaps it something you might wish to consider as a substitute.

Thank so much for your comment. Cheers and best of luck/perseverance in keeping your symptoms at bay, while also enjoying your smooth rich and drlicious cups of joe!  sigh. I do miss 'em"
10qfg04,"Thank you. I am happy to hear you are through it. May I ask how you used the pumpkin seed oil? did you use this topically, in the bath, or take as a supplement? 

Re. Steroids. I am familiar with TSW. I did end up taking prednisone but it was not effective and my flare surged back immediately afterwards. Ugh."
10qfg04,"Ugh. A familiar hitchhiker on stress, & vice versa! Hope your skin comfort remains good and your stressors take a vacation from your life soon!"
10qfg04,"Thank you. I replied with gratitude, but it appeared in the body thread and not here. New to posting, not sure how if possible to correct error."
10qfg04,This comment in response to @NUDEBISH. Looking ng as though it may not have posted in thread properly. Not sure how to fix :-/
10qfg04,"I was using The Ordinary hyaluronic acid. It make my skin crinkle and dry out more. I read somewhere that HA can cause this to happen if you have dry skin because it attracts moisture to itself - if it doesn't get enough from the outside (water in the air or on top of skin) than it will suck you dry (basically). So at first you look plumped up but then when all the HA and water evaporates off the top of your skin, you are actually less moisturized.

As for veggies, I eat what I want and can afford - I don't have any insights into what works better just because I believe that it's different for everyone. I did the 30-plants-per-week challenge (which you can look up) and found that it was easier than I thought since it includes all fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds and grains. The goal is eat variety not quantity (so you don't have to worry about serving sizes). I try to eat at least 5 different plants each week (different from last week)."
10qfg04,Just used it in the shower.. You have to sit down to do it.
10qfg04,"Oops, I meant to write @RUDEBISH, not nude. Blurry vision, another joy of aging  haha!"
10o9vlt,"My insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it (and I have excellent, what they call ‚ÄúCadillac‚Äù, insurance) but I can pay for it with FSA pre-tax funds which I budget for every year.  It‚Äôs taken out of my paycheck automatically so I don‚Äôt miss it.  As mentioned, men‚Äôs needs are often met while women are ignored and told to find a hobby"
10o9vlt,"My pellets aren't covered. I pay $360 every 3 months but I was paying $100 out of pocket after insurance for all the other hormones (cream/patch/pill) PER Month so I consider it well worth it. You can get them through ""medical spas"" for about $250-300, you just have to shop around for them.

Meanwhile men get T-clinics on every fucking corner. ""Come on down. Men, you got limp dick, can't concentrate, getting fat, can't keep up with the homies? T clinic is here for you! Right off the freeway. We have doctors, labs on site, just 10 minutes in & out! And covered by most insurance & 100% on Medicare...""

Fucking bullshit

Edit: words are hard"
10o9vlt,"In the United States, only men getting testosterone pellets are covered."
10o9vlt,My psychologist is convinced he can get them covered. He just set up labs.
10o9vlt,"I have good insurance through work and my BHRT is not covered. I have to go out of pocket every four months, for about $850. I was told is has to do with the lack of FDA approval for bio-identicals. But I feel certain testosterone for men is A-OK. 

It really burns me up."
10o9vlt,We need new people in congress who are young enough and diversified enough to appreciate our predicament. That's the only way we are going to get laws that the insurance companies will obey. Although the way things are going now we are most assuredly f*cked. Depressing.
10o9vlt,My gynecologist told me they weren't covered. I wonder if it is brand dependent?
10o9vlt,That is really sad insurance will cover men‚Äôs (menopause) problems but when it comes to our menopause woman have to pay.
10o9vlt,"I believe the technical reason is because there are no 'approved' conditions in women that T is an approved treatment for.  So insurance companies won't cover it, and many MD's are reluctant (or ignorant) to prescribe it."
10o9vlt,I used pellets for awhile. Cigna partially covered them initially but then stopped.
10o9vlt,My progesterone (pills) are covered but my clinic said testosterone is only covered for men.
10o9vlt,Testosterone injections are superior.  Much cheaper than pellets.
10o9vlt,I was able to get my treatment paid with our fsa but it was a huge pain because they didn't want to allow it. Kept arguing that it isnt a necessary treatment. Well neither is pretty much any other medical treatment. When I have a headache it isn't technically necessary to take Motrin. But it certainly is helpful and I can pay for it with my fsa with no questions or fighting necessary.
10o9vlt,"Yup, my insurance company stopped covering Prempro and Osphena, but guys can still get discounted pricing for that little blue pill."
10o9vlt,Not fair!
10o9vlt,Would be very interested to hear if it goes through!
10o9vlt,"Yep. Like I said, my coworker gets the same thing as me at his neurologist and all he has to pay is a copay."
10o9vlt,Probably not for women (because they don't think we need it) but sure men can get it and anything else they want for their issues.
10o9vlt,Weird‚Ä¶.I even up it for my medical marijuana doctor appointments without any issue.  Of course I cannot use it for actual product.
10o9vlt,Exactly‚Ä¶..men get covered for pellets and women have to pay $350 every three months or so‚Ä¶.
10o9vlt,I use my FSA debit card (pretax dollars) for pellets. Thanks for the tip on the MM doctor. I wouldn't have thought of that. Moving to a legal state soon!
1124j10,"I suggest using one of the online services specializing in HRT for menopause. They know what they're doing and focus on one thing--The one thing every other quack out there seems to be clueless about.

&#x200B;

Some of it is trial and error, but I feel it's less so with a service that's designed especially for what we're experiencing."
1124j10,"I have felt much better on estradiol patch+progesterone than I ever did on birth control.  Start by switching to estradiol and ‚Äúoral micronized progesterone‚Äù, both of which are what our bodies make (the progesterone can be taken cyclically or continuously, and taken orally or inserted vaginally). I do continuous progesterone because I struggle with emotional swings so I keep everything as ‚Äúlevel‚Äù as I can.

I didn‚Äôt have much benefit with DHEA, personally. It seemed to help for a bit‚Ä¶but then not so much.  I am on testosterone and would recommend it, but you‚Äôll likely want to dial in your E/P regimen before adding that in.  I was very happy with online for E/P treatment (I used helloalpha but there are others - just search this sub). Online won‚Äôt do testosterone, nor will a lot of in-person docs.

Do not do pellets. Not FDA-approved, you can‚Äôt adjust dosing for months, $$$, etc‚Ä¶

49F but I‚Äôve been in peri since 37 and on hormones of some kind the majority of that time.  You most certainly are not too young (by any knowledgeable person‚Äôs standard!)."
1124j10,My endocrinologist does a full blood panel for thyroid which includes all hormones.  But for me it was trial and error supplement wise.  As for the sex stuff‚Ä¶.a good lube and the rose bud üåπ toy has helped me to start figuring things out more with hubby.  Not to mention he has been doing research and we have been talking about things to try.  If it works we keep it if it doesn‚Äôt we don‚Äôt.  Still working on relearning the sensations that are new.
1124j10,Do you know how to find those?
1124j10,Thank you so much. This was hugely helpful. You‚Äôve given me the confidence to push forward
1124j10,One question: What do you pay for the online service plus meds? Thanks! Just curious about cost for it all.
1124j10,Google and/or check the  Menopause Wiki for this group.
1124j10,"I get my meds through my local pharmacy using goodrx.  It is cheaper than the online option. I‚Äôd check their website for their current pricing structure - they keep changing how they do it. I‚Äôve read some here saying there was a long delay in responses but my experience has been very good, even getting messages on the weekend. For me, the portal/messaging of helloalpha works better than a virtual real-time consult.  If you prefer virtual consult, then I‚Äôd go with another. 

Good rx is great, though. Mark Cuban‚Äôs new pharmacy discount business sounds great, too, if they have your meds, but I‚Äôve not tried them yet (I have a huge deductible so I‚Äôm essentially cash-pay for everything)."
10v3z8n,"I know you said you‚Äôre ok now, but I had a back injury when I was younger that reappeared in my 40s when I started running and still bothers me on a nearly daily basis. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to get a scan or two and maybe do some PT to prevent it from being an ongoing thing. My husband is also chronically ill and just lost a kidney to cancer, and while he would never laugh at me the ways yours did (what an ass) he does downplay any illnesses or injuries I have. If I say I have a headache (I get migraines) then he does too. If I slept poorly, he slept worse. I never thought about it as a need for me to remain healthy since he can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a much more compassionate way to look at it. Some days I want to give him a tiny gold medal and tell him he wins the Olympics of Suffering."
10v3z8n,"I have had several near misses in my life. This is a warning, You have the opportunity to make some changes and prevent a worse outcome. Change the tile. Get non skid rugs. Get grab bars installed in the bathroom. Commit to paying a different level of attention when you step over something, and never step over the dog. All too often, they stand up in the middle of the step.

One of the changes I had to implement was never walking to the kitchen without turning on a light, after I tripped over a dog who was the same color as the floor."
10v3z8n,"That‚Äôs not just an old persons incident.  It was purely an incident.  Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it.  Hell, the things I‚Äôve done to myself are alarming - but I am a known clutz.  My husband laughs at me, not because I‚Äôm hurt but the mental images he gets in his head of what I did to squire such gadfly injuries.  I‚Äôll tell you a few (in hopes it makes you feel better) I once stood on a chair to change the filter in my air con.  I slipped off the chair and managed to land inside a tripod fan, upside down.  My legs got caught on the tripod braces.  Holy hell was I bruised!  It hurt.  I also stepped on a rake (yes, just like in the cartoons) and gave myself 2 black eyes.  I‚Äôve fallen off my chair and put my hand on an oil drum with a fire raging inside.  (2nd and 3rd degree burns thank you!) I have SO many stupid, and I mean stupid injuries.  Hell, I once broke my leg walking into a hospital.  There was ice.  But hey, was in a good place to do it! 
Things are going to happen even if we try our best to ensure we aren‚Äôt making dumb choices regarding our surroundings.  I‚Äôm a bit more careful these days and try my best not to be a bull in a China shop.  One thing I do now is I take my phone when I go upstairs etc as my most recent ‚Äòinjury‚Äô (a broken rib) required an immediate trip to the hospital and it was very difficult to get down the stairs.  Phone goes everywhere now.  
Rest up, heal the bruises and the bruised ego.  Treat yourself to something nice and be grateful you got out with your dignity in tact! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
10v3z8n,"Not an ""old person"" accident. This is pretty standard H&S stuff, so don't let it mess with your head. You need non slip mats not a walker. And your husband might need a friendly elbow in the ribs. Or perhaps he'd like to have your bathroom retiled before he takes a tumble. Who's going to be smug them? üòè üòÖ

A friend posted some NSFW shower content on a shared Discord a while back, and I'm such safety geek, I replied that I hoped they had non slip mats. üòÜü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

10v3z8n,"I feel you so deeply. Fuck the hubby - it‚Äôs one thing to laugh TOGETHER after ensuring you‚Äôre ok; it‚Äôs a whole different thing to mock you to others and lack empathy to your face. It was an ACCIDENT. They happen. And I‚Äôve got (3) 125-150 pound dogs, so I understand their idiotic ability to trip us up.

My funny story: I was standing at my office wearing heels,  I stepped backward and a heel got caught in a dolly that was propped on the wall.  I fell, TIMMMMMBBBEEERRRRRRRRRR-style, straight backward.  I narrowly missed cracking my head on the metal door jam. EVERYONE IN MY OFFICE WATCHED LIKE IT WAS SLOW MOTION.   Thankfully nothing worse than bruises/soreness and sore ego.

I highly recommend an Apple Watch. Goes with you everywhere.  I‚Äôm about to be living alone in the middle of nowhere and I can‚Äôt imagine going a day without it.  Much ‚Äúhipper‚Äù than medic alert! ü§£"
10v3z8n,"I am sorry this happened to you.  A week ago my husband scared the crap out of me in the dead of night.  He went to use the bathroom and the next thing I heard was a huge crash.  He got light headed and fell pulling my towel rack down in the process.  He laughed it off but it scared me.   So sending a virtual HUG and hoping a quick recovery, as quick as your body lets you without rushing it."
10v3z8n,Your husband is a jackass. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you! I‚Äôd be furious at the husband more than anything. He‚Äôs showing you that you cannot rely on him - and he makes jokes at your expense? Wtf? Unforgivable
10v3z8n,"Non slip rugs if you can‚Äôt change the tile. Maybe both of you can. 

My husband is a little younger than me and much healthier than I am. Last summer when I had surgery and had to be cared for afterwards you‚Äôd think I had asked him to give me his skin to wear the way he was just so angry. My daughter came and cared for me during the day. My honey lost both his parents to cancer and we cared for them. He has a really hard time whenever I‚Äôm sick or injured or just having a flare (I have an Autoimmune condition and fibromyalgia) thinking I‚Äôm going to die. I think his meanness is just his way of handling it. He isn‚Äôt mean to me but he sure slams the dishes and doors and fusses about everything. 

A month ago I fell down the stairs in front of the house. They are wooden and unpainted and hadn‚Äôt been cleaned so when they are wet they are very slick. I had to yell for help from him. He came to get me up and help me inside. The next day my son-in-law came to pressure wash the stairs. They are lovely now. I wish I could say I was more embarrassed than hurt but I‚Äôm still hurting and start PT in two weeks."
10v3z8n,"I get you, but let‚Äôs not suddenly put menopausal women in their 80‚Äôs OK?

P.S. Hope you feel better soon üòò"
10v3z8n,"Um, no. No one ‚Äúdoes an ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô‚Äù when their partner has fallen and had a terrifying and painful experience. No one who is a decent human being."
10v3z8n,"But...but...but...that stuff happened even when we were younger!  I think we just bounced back faster or casted external blame instead of directing it inwards.  Like *obviously* what happened there was a result of a slippery floor and a huge dog!  If it happened to one of my kids we'd be like ooh honey let's get some grippy rugs in there to keep everyone safe!  If it happened to me I'd be like omg I'm ancient and have no balance and will surely die due to some stupid home accident (especially if my husband was rubbing it in).   

Two of the scariest things involve losing control of our bodies: falling and pooping our pants.  There's nothing like it to make you feel fragile and out of control and it's terrifying.  I like to reassure myself by remembering that I shat myself for the first time in my 20s (stomach bug) and was only just past 40 when I fell and messed up my foot big time.  I have a photo of me in one of those scooter things at Costco thinking that I was soooo old - ha!!

I honestly think that being aware of our limitations at this age (as we should be at all ages) is a *good* thing and that we should appreciate the wisdom that enables us to come up with minorly brilliant ideas to prevent getting hurt.  If this happened and you were 20 would you go out and get a sturdy rug and maybe a grip bar?  Probably not.  We are wise!"
10v3z8n,"I‚Äôm disabled, so can I throw in a recommendation for using rubber backed non slip bath mats on your bathroom floor? They make a huge difference and your dog is less likely to move them. 
Hope you are on the mend soon!"
10v3z8n,"Get new flooring. It‚Äôs a bargain compared to medical bills, disability or death."
10v3z8n,"I understand how scary this is. It basically killed my grandpa. My grandma slipped on some wet tiles in the bathroom. She spiral fractured her leg from the awkward fall, was in hospital for 3 months and basically never regained full mobility. Eventually became wheelchair reliant for anything more than a few steps around the house. Due to the accident, her mobility was severely impacted which led to a bunch of complications over the next 5 years.

While she was on the floor, my grandpa tried to help her up, he slipped and fell, broke a rib which punctured his lung and he ended up in intensive care. Again, he never really recovered properly, within 2 years was in a home and died 6 months after going into the home.

Previous to this accident, they were relatively healthy and active, although they were both very elderly. I also know a colleague who was only 26 when she fell in shower and broke her arm. 

Slippery tiles can go fuck themselves. Please just replace the tiles as a matter of urgency. No more towels on the floor."
10v3z8n,"The bathroom is the single most dangerous goddam place in the home; people are injured or die in there every day.  But because your husband has untreated trauma he's unloading on you, gaslighting you into thinking the accident happened because you're ""old"", and mocking you for it.  That's a great way to hide abuse, pretend it's humor.  Nobody ever sees through that smokescreen.  Ahem. 

That was a concatenation of events that would have brought down the most dedicated of athletes.  I'm so happy you weren't hurt.  Please take steps to fix any of the problems listed so this doesn't happen again.  Because it will, if the dog and the mat and the tile and the wet and yep it'll happen again.  Absolutely.  It's not because you're old, it's because you bathe in a bad situation.  You deserve better.  Please fix this as if your best friend needed your help with just this same problem in her porcelain bathroom, you deserve no less."
10v3z8n,Please get checked out!
10v3z8n,"Shit, I could have died years ago. If I live to my 60's it's gonna be a miracle. Those old person accidents and broken hips? That means you lived long enough to have them. Could a been worse! Could a died in your 20's of something stupid. 

Success!"
10v3z8n,"Wow, I am a little overwhelmed from the love. Thank you all.

Unfortunately replacing the tile is on the list of things we need to do (40 year old house with original everything). Non slip mats are going to have to do for now. 

My baby is part pit, part mastiff. And he is 110% sorry...I've been getting a ton of kisses and he doesn't leave my side when I'm home. 

And hubby has been dealt with. My daughter was gone this weekend, and she called me and found out I fell. Her correct responses (asking how I was, if I needed her to get me anything, take me anywhere, etc) helped a lot, and I told her about her father's reaction. Again, she was very soothing and calming with me (""You know how he is....he gets panicky when you get sick or hurt and doesn't react or handle it well"") and I was feeling better emotionally when I got off the phone. I was walking into the living room when hubby's phone rang, and his face lit up like it always does when she calls, and he greeted our daughter with his normal endearment....and then the smile faded. I stepped back so he didn't see me, and I didnt hear what she said, but from hubby's side of the conversation,  my daughter ripped him a new one. He didn't get to say one complete sentence...she cut him off each time. It was about 10 minutes of ""daddy's girl"" unleashing on him (which, trust me, hurts him more than anything I could have said).  He was quiet for awhile, now he's been asking me if I want a heating pad, a pillow...do I want him to make me some tea. And I just got a text from my daughter ...it's a big heart...my girl has my back. 

And again,  thank you all for the kind words I should have heard earlier."
10v3z8n,It‚Äôs terrifying. I fell after tripping on a rug in my bedroom last year . Broke my nose and had a terrible concussion.
10v3z8n,"I feel like the physical changes of menopause bring a heightened sense of mortality. Control the things you can (slippery floor, dog in the way) and take all the time and Tylenol you need to feel well again."
10v3z8n,"I had a moment like this several months ago. I fell on our stairs‚Ä¶ my foot just slipped out from under me as I was walking down the stairs and i landed HARD on my right butt cheek. 

I was ‚Äúfine‚Äù (just really sore) for the first 4 hours. Even walked around our large property and filled the chicken feeder with a 40lb bag of feed. 

Then I went to use the restroom and as soon as I sat down on the toilet I had crazy intense pain in my buttock. It felt like the worst muscle cramp ever and I kept thinking it would go away (like most muscle cramps eventually do). Once I stood up, my buttock was hard as a rock and quite swollen. I went and laid face down on the bed waiting for the ‚Äúcramp‚Äù to subside. 

Finally after I had laid there almost an hour my husband came in from doing yard work outside. He took one look at my swollen butt and felt how hard it was and said we were going to urgent care. 

I could barely put any weight on that side during the drive to the urgent care. By the time we were in the waiting room I was feeling super light headed and nauseous. When I got called into the exam room I was able to sit upright but as soon as the doc came in I said I had to lie down. She took one look at my injury and was completely blown away. It was a severe hematoma measuring 11 inches across. She sent me to the ER in an ambulance. 

At the ER I laid on my side on a gurney in the hall for hours. They did a CT-scan with dye. They did blood work and found I was anemic from internal bleeding. I almost passed out onto the floor when a nurse tried to help me to the restroom. 

Finally the ER docs decided to send me to the trauma center at another hospital. So it was another ambulance ride for me. 

In the trauma center I was quickly surrounded by at least 6-7 doctors and nurses. They wrapped my hips in a tight compression wrap to slow the bleeding. They made me stay overnight. The internal bleeding finally stopped but I was still anemic for a couple of weeks after. I my entire right buttock and hip were deep purple. 

It‚Äôs been several months and I have a weird indentation in my buttock‚Ä¶ scar tissue from the internal injury. 

Anyway‚Ä¶ loooooong story short, even if you think you are ‚Äúfine‚Äù at first, you might want to get it checked out."
10v3z8n,Oh man.  My friend has falling down the stairs a few times because of her dogs.  They are just accidents.  I am glad you are ok
10v3z8n,"Aw man! That sucks. It only feels like an old lady accident because we can all see the road ahead, which leads to Old Lady Town. Take care of yourself, feel better soon."
10v3z8n,"I feel for you! I think one of the worst things for me is that after an accident (in my case slipping on ice) I'm now in mortal fear of it happening again and if the temp is in the mid-30s or below I will avoid walking outside. I agree with the others, get that non slip mat and do have yourself checked out. You don't want an untreated fracture."
10v3z8n,"I've had too many accidents in the last few years, and I'm SOOOOO aware of the necessity to go slower and be more mindful. I have a tendancy to do too much at once and not ask for help. Last April I was moving a large shelf onto a different wall in my bedroom. As I was attempting to get the corner of the shelf tucked flush into the corner of the bedroom, I braced my leg against the edge and twisted to used my hip to really push it in -- and then felt a pop and my knee was immediately unstable. I thought I tore something, but nope! Fracture of the tibial plateau. The orthopedist said EIGHT WEEKS OF NO WEIGHT BEARING. I saw this as a challenge. Less than 2 years earlier I had broken BOTH ARMS AT ONCE, so I was like ""pfft I don't think so"". Honestly using the crutches was more painful than walking on it. Within 2 weeks the doctor was shocked at how well I was doing, so at least it healed fast and by the end of 8 weeks I was hiking and climbing boulders in Iceland.

But I hear my friends talking about skiing, or other fun activities I've loved in life and my first thought is how badly I could be injured. It sucks. Also I started a dance class in October and immediately sprained my ankle the first night! I don't want to think all of this is age related, but if it is I fear for my future because I'm only 46!"
10v3z8n,"I'm disabled AND clumsy AND I live alone.

 Hope your hubby figures out sympathy. I'm sure future y'all can laugh at this together, but right now he's the only one laughing."
10v3z8n,I‚Äôm so sorry. Glad you didn‚Äôt have any broken bones.  This kind of thing happens to everyone at some point.  You deserve time to heal physically and emotionally. Hugs to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10v3z8n,"I'm so very sorry,  better bath mats asap.  And we must choose our steps carefully. I broke my tibia by missing the bottom rung of my ladder.  And was alone. So I know that feeling.  I'm so sorry that you are hurt.  Make sure you didn't do damage though."
10v3z8n,"Hey, do I had a really bad fall over the top of a mountain bike last year. I landed on the left side of my body & thought I broke my collarbone! My leg & hip were killing me and I ended up doing PT months later for my hips. Just wanted to say don‚Äôt ignore the pain!"
10v3z8n,Im so sorry! What a scary experience. I would recommend getting an X-ray of your hip just in case. I had a stress fracture on my hip and let it hurt for 6 months before getting checked out. Almost had to have surgery. I hope you feel better soon! Take all the time YOU need!
10v3z8n,"Oh, you poor thing. I have no words of wisdom, but I completely sympathize. I‚Äôm sending you a huge virtual hug!!!!"
10v3z8n,I slipped on the stairs a few weeks ago and my shoulder is still jacked up. It‚Äôs scary and was a bit of a wake up call that I need to be diligent and care for my body. If you can - consider checking in with the doctor just in case you hurt something seriously. A visit to the orthopedist for me helped me understand my pain and better manage it and treat it but I still have a month before I can lift weights again.
10v3z8n,‚ù§Ô∏è
10v3z8n,"Oh, honey.

When I was younger, I did all kinds of extreme sports and I've got the surgeries, scars, and titanium implants to remember it.  I have paid dearly for my heroics and athleticisms in my youth (and well beyond any age anyone would think was reasonable to do dangerous things).

I would hurl myself down a double black diamond with abandon (into my 40s), throw myself up hills on my dirtbike (into my 40s), rock climb, rocker the handlebars on my jetski to make it jump higher and sharper, rollerblade with abandon on concrete sidewalks at abandoned buildings, pretty much anything you can think of physically that could be harmful to life and limb, I indulged because I was going to live forever.

My brain still thinks I'm still that woman.  ROARRRR, says my brain, remembering bygone days.

But I'm also the woman who can step funny on the stairs while windmilling my arms wildly thinking OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD IS THIS THE TIME I FINISH MYSELF OFF...and I'm on the third step.

Age has a funny way of creeping up on you; in my head, I can leap over a fence with no issues.  I try that shit now and I'll wind up with torn pants and a bad case of embarrassment - if I'm lucky.

I'm sorry your husband is being such a dick about it; just because he's had a bout of bad luck with chronic illness and cancer doesn't mean that you don't deserve sympathy and time to recover from your own ills and hurts.  Men can have a peculiar type of shortsightedness when it comes to our health; I firmly believe it's because they're scared shitless at the thought of us becoming incapacitated - because then who would take care of them?  Mine is a little better than many, only because in addition to the 15 surgeries I've had, he's had several of his own, so he *knows* what it's like to be in chronic pain, laid up, and miserable.  He knows what it's like tooling along like a happy little clam, only to get blindsided by a bad meniscus or a fucked-up spinal disc or a torn tendon that needs repair.

However...

We do have a spate of comparison-playing around here, what I like to refer to as The Oppression Olympics.  As in, if I say I have a headache, he'll leap to tell me WULL I HAVE A MIGRAINE or I HAD A HEADACHE LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THE WOOOOORRRRST.  

Hang on, I need to grab my eyeballs, I rolled them so hard they just jumped out of my skull with a champagne cork-popping sound.

Dear, we're not playing the Oppression Olympics, and my headache doesn't need to compete against your migraine, we're both not feeling great, just make a grunt of commiseration and say something useless like ""Damn, that sucks"" and go from there.  No one is getting a goddamn gold medal for being laid up.

But I digress.

Hugs to you; you'll heal in time (and your own goddamn time, thankyouverymuch) and there are some good suggestions for hedging against further injuries and insults in the future! <3"
10v3z8n,"I have lived in a house for over 20 years with high gloss tile. It‚Äôs a safety hazard for ALL ages. My kids, my husband and I have all had falls over the years. It‚Äôs incredibly slick when wet. It‚Äôs not your age, it‚Äôs the tile."
10v3z8n,"Nonslip bathmats would be a good investment. Assuming that your son is not a child, maybe leave the dog with him the next time or find a place to safely lock him up. I am sympathetic even though I may not sound that way, I tend to be pretty matter-of-fact. I‚Äôm 61 and I have arthritis as well as being postmenopausal so I understand the value of being a safe as possible. 

As for your husband, you should very firmly remind him that if he expects you to look after him in his dotage, he better stop being a dick. You do not need this shit when you‚Äôve had a bad scare.  Honestly his behaviour is bullying and very selfish. 

What happened to you could happen to anybody of any age. Bathroom accidents are very common."
10v3z8n,"This kind of accident can happen to any of us at any age, but the older we get, the more dangerous these kinds of falls can be. Definitely think you should get checked out to make sure you don‚Äôt have a hairline fracture or something else that could continue to cause problems."
10v3z8n,"I feel you on all of this. One night I fell out of bed getting out of bed, and bruised myself really badly. I couldn‚Äôt even get off the floor. Scary!"
10v3z8n,"You are a young lady, i can tell by ur letter, we arent all our Chronological age!! And omg porcelain my Mom had installed in kitchen n liv room and my feet hurt so bad on that floor!! Even w shoes. Its the hardedt of floorin they told us!! Ur beautiful, feel that today!!üíñüíúüíØ"
10v3z8n,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me as well-- rolled my foot in a rut in the lawn (crunched so bad it might've broken something but I never got it checked, just hobbled a couple days), slipped down the wet deck stairs in worn out Crocs, and they were just jerryrigged rough 2 x 6 planks-- 2 of them hard across my back and winded me, face planted on a paved driveway, threw my back out putting wood in... and I got very little sympathy from my husband too. Lots of ""well you shouldn't have..."" comments. From the guy who *almost always* will crack his head (hard) on the squared  ductwork in the basement like he's never noticed it before ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It takes everything in me not to be snarky and say something like, ""What? You've never been down here before?"" or out and out bitchy with a ""open your damn eyes, man, and pay attention"" ... He, too, has health issues and it's possible he ""needs"" me to be the healthy one. He's terrified of ending up alone, and is aware that I have no such fear. 


On the dog end of things, ours is mostly black and likes to sleep in doorways. I tend to have minimal lights on after 10, and he blends in. I've gotten in the habit of checking the floor before I walk through, after  connecting with his head more than once. When we're in the bathroom he parks it right in front of the door, and would definitely come in if the door wasn't latched."
10v3z8n,"I feel you. 

About three years ago i missed a step up and face planted on concrete. The only thing between me and broken bones was that i fell onto another ledge that forced me into a roll. 

It was so frightening I have been exercising every day since. When i got injured‚Äîwhich is what always happens when i‚Äôm ‚Äúworking out‚Äù‚Äîinstead of quitting i went to a physical therapist who showed me the real exercises i needed to do. 

Now i have a really strong core. I had jogged and swam up to this point, and  though my core was getting appreciably stronger, it wasn‚Äôt even close to the increase in strength from the PTs targeted exercises. 

Anyway‚Äînow i can catch myself before i hit the ground in a way that wasn‚Äôt possible before. 

Good luck with everything."
10v3z8n,"WTF I would be so pissed at his reaction! I don‚Äôt really have any helpful advice, but there‚Äôs been times when I go out to get the mail later at night or let the dog out and imagine myself slipping and falling (Minnesota winter) and no one knowing I‚Äôm outside, not having my phone with me‚Ä¶it‚Äôs definitely a concern that I never thought about when I was younger. How did he respond when you told him you needed sympathy instead of jokes? Maybe he jokes because he‚Äôs afraid of something bad happening to you? My FIL never knew how to respond correctly when someone got hurt, his go to was getting angry and yelling at the hurt person. Knowing what was behind his reaction didn‚Äôt make it any easier to deal with though. Anyway, I hope you feel better soon and I would definitely be looking into getting nonslip mats or a grab bar or something for the bathroom."
10v3z8n,"I‚Äôm so sorry! How scary - and your hubs is being a dick, 100%. Please get looked at. You may feel something in a few weeks or months from this that you don‚Äôt notice now. 

But above all of this I am thinking about your tile. What kind of tile is it? Is it wall tile or floor tile designed for wet floors?Because you may have a lawsuit with the manufacturer if you are hurt - depending on the type of tile. There are products that can be coated on your floors to avoid this happening in the future. I think it‚Äôs called Stone Grip. 

Please get checked out and be gentle with yourself. Next dozen times hubs needs help, I would be conveniently deaf if I were you."
10v3z8n,"Also a reminder to work on our balance.  

OP obviously in this scenario having good balance wasn't likely to change the outcome...but practicing balance is so important to fall prevention.  

>Risk factors for falls in order of evidence strength include a history of falls, **impairment in balance,** reduced muscle strength, visual problems, polypharmacy (defined as taking over four medications) or psychoactive drugs, gait difficulty, depression, orthostasis or dizziness, functional limits, female sex, incontinence, cognitive difficulties, arthritis, diabetes, and pain."
10v3z8n,Oh that sucks. You will probably bruise up a bit too. Godspeed on feeling better.
10v3z8n,"That‚Äôs not an old person accident, that‚Äôs a gigantic dog accident. I used to run a boarding kennel so I‚Äôd consider myself somewhat of an expert. 

Now I own miniature dachshunds. They take up much less real estate but have a big dog attitude."
10v3z8n,My Dogs are major creeps. I don't even bother closing the show door because Snoot Gunna Snoot.
10v3z8n,"I always take my phone into the bathroom and make sure it is within my reach for reasons like this.     I live alone.  My Mom used to always insist on putting one of those rubber mats in the shower, she bought me one for her to use when she was here.     I understand fully why she did.   I am glad you are okay."
10v3z8n,"Check it out. Even if nothing shows on the X-ray, be extra careful for the next six months. Oh the fun coccyx!"
10v3z8n,Just came to say get some of those bathtub stickers that are rough and stick them on your tiles! You don't want to fall again!
10v3z8n,"Get that flooring replaced, sounds horrible. If you haven‚Äôt already, grab bars in the shower while you‚Äôre at it (I realize that they wouldn‚Äôt have helped in this circumstance)."
10v3z8n,Just here to offer sympathy. I have cats and dogs prone to getting under my feet and I always worry about falling downstairs or in the kitchen because they‚Äôre under foot.
10v3z8n,I can‚Äôt recommend yoga enough! Im there for the help improving and maintaining my balance. I‚Äôve always been clumsy so I know I have to do something to help! Hope you feel better soon love! üå∏
10v3z8n,"I was watching a soccer game on a large TV by a bar and when I jumped up I pissed my pants, not even incontinence. It was definitely I‚Äôm a 45 year old lady woman"
10v3z8n,"My 23 year old niece fell in the bathroom and nearly broke her ass.  From what you described this has nothing to do with age.  You a slippery ass bathroom floor.  Your ass is sore enough, you don‚Äôt need to give your self a beating on top of it!  ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10v3z8n,"Tell your husband I said he‚Äôs not cool, in fact he‚Äôs an a-hole. I‚Äôm sorry and hope you feel better soon. Take care."
10v3z8n,Good wake up call for may of us. I hate the moments of assessing if anything is broken and how bad the situation is. Happy you're mostly okay. Hopeful you find the sympathy you need at home.
10v3z8n,"I just want to encourage you to seek medical care for your injury. I had my own ""old people"" accident a few years ago, slipping on wet tile as well, and severely injured my knee. It hurt so bad I thought I broke my leg in several places.

I went to physiotherapy for many weeks, and it was months before I could walk without a limp. even with the strength re-building and range of motion exercises my knee is permanently damaged. I'd hate to think how bad it would be if I had just assumed it was a simple sprain and left it to heal on its own. 

I would see if there is a non-slip coating you could use on your tile floors. We had one applied to the concrete floor in our shower and it makes a huge difference."
10v3z8n,"I think that you just had a bad accident. The bathroom floor was too slippery, the dog was goofing around and it was not a good day. It is just a good reminder to change the tiles in the bathroom and maybe make it a bit bigger, if you have the means to do so."
10v3z8n,I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you and I‚Äôm so glad you let us know so we can send you love.
10v3z8n,"Oh, I'm sorry that happened to you.  

I think a sturdy hammer could be your best bet here.  Break those tiles so that there's no excuse not to replace them.  After that, some good non-slip rugs."
10v3z8n,I'm sorry. I know what it's like to be in pain/discomfort and have other people treat it as a big joke. It's not fun. I hope you feel better. Did you take ibuprofen or something similar?
10v3z8n,"Wow. I'm so sorry, and yeah, that's how it goes, it's not the falling but the falling weird & disoriented. If you're still hurting in a few days, go get an x-ray just in case. 

And let your husband have it. He can grow the fuck up or leave."
10v3z8n,Oh sweetheart
10v3z8n,"Glad you‚Äôre ok. This can happen at any age!  And your son would have survived seeing you btw üòÜ.

I live alone and this kind of thing stresses me out so much. I‚Äôm really careful but things still happen and I worry how long it would take for someone to find me if something happens."
10v3z8n,"I fell down twice in two days. It really shakes your confidence and you start walking very carefully and slowly.  I also have a partner who seems incapable of empathy and support. Unfortunately, I cannot rely on him if I have a medical emergency due to my chronic illness."
10v3z8n,Fix the bloody tiles. Textured spray or something so it doesn‚Äôt happen again!üò©üòû
10v3z8n,"Aw jeez. Big sympathy. These moments are scary. 

As a huge giant dog fan, I need to know what kind of doggy you have"
10v3z8n,"I had a similar accident when I was 19 so it's not just us old ladies. Scary though, I am glad you are not seriously hurt.

Also food for thought, I would think someone who has a chronic illness and beat cancer would have a little more empathy."
10v3z8n,"You need a floor gripper under the towel  or it can always slide.

Or pick a textured tile for the landing segment and replace the smooth tile in that area.

Grab bars on the walls improve safety too."
10v3z8n,I agree with this - get it checked out. And your husband is a jerk.
10v3z8n,"Wow....it's almost like I am writing this. It's exactly what goes on here, and it drives me insane. I would love to be able to say something is wrong without an instant ""one upping"" me. This time he couldn't do that, so he went with ""humor"" to try and lessen it. 

We belong to the club no one wants to join. ""In sickness and in health""...really should have paid attention to those words...lol"
10v3z8n,"LOL - my hubby is the same. One time I was having *abdominal pain* (my delicate way, at the time, of describing menstrual cramps).  Wouldn't you know it - HE was having pain, too!

""Oh no! Your uterus is cramping and bleeding too?  Poor baby!""

But he was never an asshole to me about illnesses & injuries. He knew, if I wasn't laughing about it - it was definitely not open to his shitty jokes!"
10v3z8n,"Oh man, grab bars for the win! When I was younger, I moved into my grandmothers house after she passed (dad wanted it to be occupied until they remodeled and sold it) and I got used to having grab bars everywhere. They saved my ass so many times back when I was young and clumsy, instead of middle aged and clumsy."
10v3z8n,So right about stepping over a pet! They will stand every time you try to step over them!! Do not do it!!
10v3z8n,"I went into the kitchen in the middle of the night without turning a light on as I always wander about in the dark with no issue, and then I fell over an enormous hedgehog which had somehow got in and was just chilling in the middle of the kitchen."
10v3z8n,"If you can't change the tile, get those antislip stickers. Then you don't depend on a towel or mat. They have the nail file type ones (ouch) but also some silicone type ones you are fine to step barefoot on."
10v3z8n,"I feel ya. I nearly came a cropper, because my cats are grey."
10v3z8n,"One thing I've discovered about my bathroom layout...it's got to be addressed for issues down the road. The toilet is right next to the shower...there is nothing to grab to assist in getting on or off the toilet (I discovered that, not normally an issue). The tile in the actual shower isn't slippery at all, but there are zero grab bars (or shelve/step for shaving purposes). 

I normally have to close my bedroom door if I'm to keep the dog completely out. The bathroom door is a ""pocket door"" without a lock, and he's learned to slam his body against it and slide, opening the door. He's actually joined me in the shower (lawn guys showed up with that scary loud lawnmower...and there he is, sitting in the shower looking up at me)."
10v3z8n,">That‚Äôs not just an old persons incident.  It was purely an incident.  Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it.  Hell, the things I‚Äôve done to myself are alarming - but I am a known clutz. 

Same. If we're sharing stories, when I was in my early 30s I was living on the 2nd/3rd floor in a lovely old brownstone that had fabulous, old hardwood floors - including the staircase. Not once, but twice--twice!!!--I fell down the entire staircase because I wasn't paying attention and miscalculated my first step (and was wearing only socks). I don't know how I made it through both falls with just nasty black and blues and a bone fracture in one ring finger (it still bothers me now and then, 20 years later). I could have easily broken my neck, cracked my skull, etc. I also was living alone so if I had been knocked unconscious or been unable to move, who knows how long I would have been there before someone might have noticed or come looking for me."
10v3z8n,You‚Äôre amazing!!!
10v3z8n,Well said!
10v3z8n,"> Hell, I once broke my leg walking into a hospital. There was ice.

My sister once broke her wrist, (compound fracture <shudder>), waving down a fire truck.

The scene was the day after a fresh snow, and her front walk/stairs/driveway was now iced over.  The local fire department had Fireman Santa driving by and she wanted to stop them for her children.

She ran out, waving them down, slipped and fell, attempting to stop her fall with her hand."
10v3z8n,"Omg...**hugs** I thought I was a clutz, but you my dear have far surpassed me."
10v3z8n,I am with Coolbreeze. Apple Watch for the win. Got mine right before my 50th birthday. Wear it in the shower. Wear it always. I got it at my husbands urging due to a nasty fall in the bathroom.
10v3z8n,This is so smart. I‚Äôve been taking mine off even though I know it‚Äôs waterproof. I‚Äôll start keeping it on (and not forget to turn on water mode!)
10v3z8n,I love my apple watch but lately it's been irritating my skin something fierce. A symptom I'm attributing to... you guessed it... menopause.
10v3z8n,"Second the Apple Watch. I fell really hard about 6 months ago and it was all ready to phone emergency services. Had my partner not been there I probably would‚Äôve used it. (It was dark, in a place I didn‚Äôt know)."
10v3z8n,"I was never able to wear normal watches, because my wrists always broke out. Didn't matter the type of watch (my mom thought everyone should wear one, and kept trying to find a strap that wouldn't affect my skin). Is the material on it different than a normal watch?"
10v3z8n,"We put luxury vinyl plank in our bathroom. It looks like wood. Super easy to install (score and snap), waterproof, and grippy. Our bathroom isn‚Äôt large, so it only took one box."
10v3z8n,"So glad she was there to care about and comfort you, and then knock some sense into that man. Hope his good behavior lasts.    Take care of you. ü§ó"
10v3z8n,"The Oppression Olympics, touch√©"
10v3z8n,That‚Äôs amazing! And way to be proactive. I started doing Pilates and the difference in my core has been amazing.
10v3z8n,"This house is over 40 years old, and has been thru multiple owners. I'm pretty sure the tile is original, but who really knows. I'm guessing the person who picked the tile also picked the shell sink countertop in what I describe as fleshtone (complete with bluish veins running thru it). 

It's ugly but it's mine...lol"
10v3z8n,"My phone was in the bathroom, but completely unreachable.

Like your name btw..."
10v3z8n,Yeah that stuff you describe with your husband is sending up major red flags. Not okay.
10v3z8n,"I always feel so guilty after I say anything even slightly negative about him. I knew when I married him that he was 8 years older and that would affect me in our later years, but he was so smart and funny and had such a different perspective on the world that I was entranced by him. I'll take care of him for the rest of our lives and be glad of the opportunity but it does feel better to vent to complete strangers who won't judge him or me for it. <3"
10v3z8n,I need to install one for my bathtub. I am inherently clumsy.
10v3z8n,"We moved into a house that had them installed already, so I‚Äôve been using them well before the intended age and need arose.

I‚Äôm still spry and limber, but on vacation last week (in one of those beautiful but not very functional) open space Instagram multi directional showers I realized ‚Äòwhat do I hold onto while washing my feet?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhere do I step to shave my leg?‚Äô it was all smooth empty marble tile.

Mid shower and I felt like I was in the worlds most slick and serene seeming death trap."
10v3z8n,"The house we bought 2years ago was owned by a lady in her 70‚Äôs who needed a hip replacement (part of why she was moving). The main bedroom‚Äôs bathroom has a step in shower with a little bench in the corner and she had two grab bars installed, as well as one in the garage by the step. It‚Äôs not something I would have thought to put in at this point but they are so handy if I decide to shave my legs and it‚Äôs nice to know they‚Äôre there if I need them."
10v3z8n,I got them when I was pregnant and hubby was working lots of overtime. Love having them in the bathroom now
10v3z8n,My cat will not rest until he has forced someone to break a hip.
10v3z8n,My cat likes to hide on the first step of the stairs going into the basement. It's a trap.
10v3z8n,"Our dog plants herself directly behind my feet always, and she's a sneaky MFer so a lot of the time I don't realize she's there until I turn around and almost fall over her. I have a bum ankle because I tripped over her a couple years ago and tore ligaments."
10v3z8n,My high pitched screams would have woken everyone in the neighborhood.
10v3z8n,"You can get cute tub ones on Amazon! I've seen shark, goldfish, duck ones."
10v3z8n,"Well, I don‚Äôt feel quite so bad then!  üòù"
10v3z8n,ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ 13 broken and dislocated bones and counting‚Ä¶..  it was a joke in my town that I had a permanent bed in the emergency room.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10v3z8n,"Oh, are Apple Watches okay to be in the shower? Good to know"
10v3z8n,"I wear mine swimming but I‚Äôve always worried about soap in the shower.

Does it seem to affect it?

That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôm up and about and not wearing it‚Ä¶it only charges when I‚Äôm sitting and doing my nightly routine or watching tv."
10v3z8n,"My concern is what happens if emergency services shows up, but they can't get inside?? We have sturdy locks and the doors are always locked, so even if I did manage to call for help from a watch or phone, they'd have to break their way in, and then leave the house wide open for anybody to help themselves. Luckily we have nice neighbors so I guess we could ask them to keep an eye on things."
10v3z8n,Water node happens automatically. You just have to remember to unlock it from water mode (which is easy to remember when it doesn‚Äôt respond to taps!)
10v3z8n,I have also started getting really irritated skin from things that have never bothered me. Sterling silver has been giving me rashes. Swimming has been doing the same. I also attribute it to perimenopause. The amount of symptoms I have is unreal. My GP won't help though.
10v3z8n,That's why I hesitate to get one.  My wrists don't like anything touching them.
10v3z8n,"I‚Äôm so sorry!  Yikes it‚Äôs always scary. But the last thing my husband says at night is ‚Äúis your watch on and charged?‚Äù Shower. Pool. Whatever. It‚Äôs on. I have him and my BFF (who also WFH) to be called. 

Yeah I‚Äôm 51 with fall protection. So what. Better to have it and not need it than the other way around. I‚Äôm not embarrassed. I‚Äôm keeping myself safe."
10v3z8n,"You can buy a million different bands. The back of the watch itself is glass. You can choose different metals (cost varies, of course) but there are no exposed batteries which often cause the issue on normal watches."
10v3z8n,"Oh, I'm going to do that! We have older tile that is terribly slippery (we do have a non-slip mat and a longer runner that doesn't slide, but we're going to renovate that bathroom sometime soon anyway.)"
10v3z8n,"I have a client (side gig cleaning houses) that had that put in her kitchen and bathrooms to replace tile.  Hers does NOT look like wood since she got blue (wood grain, but blue). Everything else is pure white so it is pretty. But it is sooo much easier to clean from my standpoint."
10v3z8n,The core seems to have its own memory when its strong. It reminds itself to sit up straight and lift with the knees. Lol
10v3z8n,"Oh I get that. Hubby has had a LOT to deal with besides his illness, and his ""jokster"" personality was something that attracted me to him many moons ago, so I know he's not a monster. He's just an idiot sometimes."
10v3z8n,"I got them before my knee replacement, and now I wonder how I didn't kill myself beforehand."
10v3z8n,Our cat likes to figure 8 between my legs as I walk. He's a deathtrap.
10v3z8n,We have a cat as well. I have a house of impending doom...lol
10v3z8n,My cat does this on our staircase. It's a toss up whether she swipes at us or not as were descending or climbing. Little shit is going to be the death of me when I'm not paying attention.
10v3z8n,"We've had those too. I was constantly apologizing ""I'm sorry...I didn't know you were there!"""
10v3z8n,"oh no i thought he was lovely, I picked him up in my bare hands but i couldn't stroke him because he rolled up in a ball and then he was a bit prickly so i took him in a towel and put him in the garden and gave him a little box to stay in, but he decided to go into a hole and come out at night so I've been feeding him in the box when comes out at night since November, but this week he hasn't come out and hasn't eaten so i think he must be hibernating."
10v3z8n,"You can swim with them on!  It‚Äôs has a ‚Äòwater‚Äô mode you turn on before swimming/showering, when you turn it off the watch vibrates to knock out any excess water as well."
10v3z8n,Nothing has compromised mine. Shower. Pool. Etc. it‚Äôs still working.
10v3z8n,Get a lockbox. Less that $20 at lowes/HD.
10v3z8n,I am convinced the stairs in my house will be the death of me.
10v3z8n,"TIL, thanks!"
10v3z8n,Yep. I refer to mine as the staircase of doom.
111crmb,"Hair migration!  My body can suck in an eyebrow hair and re-pop it out on my chin!
Edited for spelling."
111crmb,"I have discovered that when my body is on a diet, my husband loses weight. Amazing!"
111crmb,"You guys are lucky, my hot flashes are all in my head according to my female doctor.  üôÑ"
111crmb,Hot flashes are amazing. You don‚Äôt think you can sweat from the inside but here we are.
111crmb,That I can be sweat dripping hot and freezing cold at the same time.  Also found that because I am ‚Äúrelearning‚Äù how to deal with sex and the ‚Äúfun‚Äù side effects we get (enter sarcasm here) that things have definitely changed since before my sex drive vanished.
111crmb,Good news! What I thought were wrinkles around my mouth are only about half wrinkles and the other half is hair.
111crmb,I've also learned that cycling between hot flashes and cold flashes means my lower legs can go from hot-to-the-touch to frozen stumps in a matter of minutes!
111crmb,I can burp for Ireland!
111crmb,"Omg, I've found my people!!! Today my hands were like blocks of ice, and my face was on fire... 

But the worst bit is , and I'm so sorry to be sharing this , the butt sweat."
111crmb,"Hello! I have what I think must be the itchiest asshole on earth! 

This is so fun!"
111crmb,"I live in a place that was recently -20 F with no heat in the bedroom, and I woke up sweating. It's a miracle!"
111crmb,"Not only are chin and upper lip hairs a nuisance,  but I have discovered tiny hairs growing out of the corners of my ACTUAL LIPS!!!"
111crmb,"I have a 12-week old puppy and he was sleeping in bed with me. I touched his back and it was VERY wet, and my first thought was that he'd peed the bed and gotten it all over himself.

Nope. My sweat. He was drenched with my sweat."
111crmb,someone else with sweaty shins!
111crmb,"Sweating from your elbows from hot flashes, I should note this was a couple of years ago and my hot flashes are much more under control now, but yea I never sweated from my elbows before in my life until peri."
111crmb,"Sweaty palms and sweaty feet while the rest of me is freezing cold. Bloated all the time with no weight gain , and hair went from curly to straight. Also started having ocular migraines, no headache tho thankfully."
111crmb,Hysterectomy belly. I can hide stuff in there. But all it‚Äôs good for is - you guessed it!- sweat and rashes!
111crmb,"Every single inch of my body can sweat. I can have glorious zits AND wrinkles at the same time. I can bleed for over a month straight and not die. (What?!) The hair on my head is disappearing while I have to be vigilant about it popping up somewhere else (I‚Äôm looking at you, chin hairs‚Ä¶.)."
111crmb,Itchy ears. So itchy. Make it stop.
111crmb,"Growing of moustache on my upper lip and chin - I‚Äôve never needed a pair of tweezers more regularly than now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Oh and hair on the back of my upper thighs - What the ACTUAL FFFFF???"
111crmb,I haven‚Äôt had a period in‚Ä¶.. ??? Surprise. 54 and cramps like a teenager ü§¨
111crmb,"The back of the hand sweat is so weird! Mine starting doing that right around the same time peri started (42)

My biggest problem at the moment is the grey pubes. I don‚Äôt want to shave my bush off since I don‚Äôt even have a boyfriend but this greying birds nest is frightening. I‚Äôm going to dye them next time I do my roots"
111crmb,My body can manifest an olympic size swimming pool in bed for me to emerge from each morning!
111crmb,"My brilliant fat cells have all migrated from the sexy parts of my body (lower ass and hips) to totally unsexy areas: my belly and I now have fat where a ‚Äútramp stamp‚Äù tattoo would go. Hot! The great news? Now that my sex drive is zero and my cunt is atrophying, I don‚Äôt give a shit! üí´üåü"
111crmb,"My elbow pits (ha) sweat and itch now, so I routinely apply antiperspirant there too. Sigh."
111crmb,"I've learned to love cold feet. If I warm my ice block feet too fast, I become a sweaty, nauseous mess.  

I've also learned that one can have sweaty elbows."
111crmb,hahahaha this made my day. i‚Äôve literally never been more sweaty in my life lol.
111crmb,I can stink immediately after taking a shower.
111crmb,Oof. I wear nitrile gloves at my lab job and they fill up like water balloons while I'm wearing them.
111crmb,"I‚Äôve discovered that my body decided to move focus from producing healthy head hair (seriously, it looks and feels like brittle straw these days) to making prolific butt crack hair that, I am sure, is creeping close to braiding length. ü´†"
111crmb,"Now when I feel anxious I get a hot flush all over - which calms me down immediately!

Narrator: but in fact, it did not calm her down at all‚Ä¶"
111crmb,My feet are blocks of ice while also sweating buckets. Incredibly long coarse hairs that magical pop out of the back of my knees. 2 just 2 nails on my left hand grow Incredibly fast & thick while the rest a brittle
111crmb,How it's possible to be both melting with a hot flash on my torso and my hands are freezing at the same time.
111crmb,"The hair on my head is thinning at the part and hairline. New hair growth is glacial resulting in Dr. Seuss like tufts poking out all over.

 Meanwhile my face is able to grow a 2 inch long coarse black air overnight. So. Awesome.

And a quiet fuck you to the people who see the new face hair and don't say anything until I discover it. Thanks for the heads up asshole!"
111crmb,"I can piss for 2 people easily.

Yesterday I was already pissing when a work colleague entered the next stall, pissed, washed her hands and when she was about to leave I finally opened the door of my stall. This was the mid afternoon, the morning ones are bigger.

My wife said she wants me to piss in a bucket one morning just to see how much volume I can create. She thinks it must be around 3 Liters."
111crmb,"The backs of my knees can sweat.

My undertones have changed. I look like ""who dat and what the hell for"", in colors I had no issues with (why didn't anyone tell me that would happen?

other people have been freezing this winter. Not me. It feels bloody good...for about 30 min. every hour."
111crmb,"I found that internally I am a raging inferno oozing sweat while the air outside is minus something meaning I am a ball of steam walking about in very little clothing. 
Even science is bewildered by my body"
111crmb,Burning mouth and geographic tongue are quite interesting!!! NOT
111crmb,"I started getting laser hair removal on my chin two weeks ago, and already my chin is popping out wiry, white whiskers.  It should be noted that I am 38 and should not have white whiskers yet!  WTF!  So I‚Äôm going to finish the course of laser hair reduction for the few black hairs but also get electrolysis for the white ones.  Such BS though!"
111crmb,Amazing! üòÑ
111crmb,"Does he show you his little belly and say, ‚ÄúI am NOT skinny!‚Äù?"
111crmb,Yes! And people will notice his weight loss as he just shrugs and chugs his beer while I sit there fat and hungry. It‚Äôs perfect!
111crmb,Mine does that too- rude!
111crmb,üòÜ same!! Dammit!
111crmb,Whatttttttttt!! That's unbelievable üò≥
111crmb,"If she‚Äôs young now,  she‚Äôll get her comeuppance eventually!"
111crmb,I'd slap a ho.
111crmb,Time to find a new doc.
111crmb,Mine said it was totally impossible I could be in peri because I was 42 (at that time) _eyeroll_
111crmb,My husband will suggest a fan but I would freeze bc hot flashes *are on the inside*
111crmb,Same. I was shivering with cold at work while my equally cold right armpit poured sweat down my arm. Just my right one though!
111crmb,Lollll this got me good
111crmb,I'm a windsock in the mornings.
111crmb,So listen. The butt sweat was killing me. Started Estridol (sp?) a month ago and it‚Äôs significantly better.
111crmb,"I got a yeast infection in my buttcrack last spring from
sweat üëçüëçüëç"
111crmb,"So, do you apply your hand to your face to try to achieve balance?"
111crmb,The butt sweat is the worst! When it happens I just pray that I‚Äôm sitting on a cloth seat and the proof is not so prevalent when I stand up!
111crmb,"Northern Wisconsin, USA, here. I just open the patio door and stand in the blast of Arctic air to cool down during hot flashes! Not sure what I'll do in the summer, but we're still many, many months away from that."
111crmb,THOSE!  THOSE little bastards and they hurt like HELL when you try to tweeze or wax them!  And they're BLACK!  All the fuzzies on my face are blonde but not those little suckers!
111crmb,Italian here:  been getting those since my 20s‚Ä¶
111crmb,Not just me then ü§£
111crmb,"It's delightful, isn't it?"
111crmb,And they soak your effing pants! Not cool!
111crmb,I‚Äôm 43 and prediabetic and have discovered if I don‚Äôt eat much sugary salt before bed my morning sweats are much more barely. I have also found that caffeine exacerbates it. I try to keep it to one cup or else I‚Äôm sweating all morning. This may help y‚Äôall!
111crmb,"Oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been having those for about 20 years (I‚Äôm 65, full menopause was 20 years ago‚Ä¶. 2+2=4!)"
111crmb,Mine went wavy/frizzy from stick straight.
111crmb,My hair went from full and wavy to straight and dead. No body no waves it just hangs and always looks greasy.
111crmb,OMG ME TOO ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
111crmb,Yes!!! Why?!!?
111crmb,This reminded me of a SATC episode when Samantha dyes her pubes. Bozo the bush!
111crmb,Maybe henna would help? All natural at least.
111crmb,"Weirdly, although I started going gray at 23, that's only affected the hair on my head!"
111crmb,I'm glad this thread could make you laugh! I'm enjoying reading all of the responses. Misery truly DOES love company!
111crmb,SAME
111crmb,"I had geographic tongue for a few years in my mid-30s! Never figured out the cause, though corn consumption did seem related."
111crmb,I started getting electrolysis last April and I highly recommend. I used to not be able to leave  town for a day without my tweezers. Just research your practitioner as I had lots of unsuccessful electrolysis before this go.
111crmb,Lol yes‚Ä¶he loves to say mee too‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm also getting fat‚Ä¶.but he‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs me.
111crmb,Hells YEA! üò† üòÜ
111crmb,My old doc told me the same bullshit. Now I have a new primary care and a new gyn....both are worlds better.
111crmb,I never realized you could be hot and cold at the same time - and get here we are lol.
111crmb,ü§£I have to have a fan on me when I put my clothes in and get ready or I‚Äôm a sweating mass and my shower was for nothing
111crmb,"Omg, going to look that up, thanks!"
111crmb,"OMG I know this is awful, but this made me immediately laugh out loud. The thumbs ups are fabulous."
111crmb,I feel your pain...
111crmb,Wow!! Now that‚Äôs talent. üéñÔ∏è
111crmb,Yes! I look like the figure in 'The Scream' at least ten times a day!!!

111crmb,Indubitably!
111crmb,"I already keep my added sugars to <10g per day, and I'm still getting 15+ hot flashes/night sweats every day. 

I guess I'll have to cut out my tea to see if that has any effect. :("
111crmb,Bless you dear. My mom is 67 and says she still gets them occasionally but nothing like she had in her 40s and 50s. Fingers crossed I don‚Äôt have this torture for 20 years.
111crmb,And mine went from straight to wavy!
111crmb,How did you know I was gonna dye it red
111crmb,"Henna turns green on me so nahhhhh haha I‚Äôll use the same bottle of
Madison reed I use on my head"
111crmb,I got my first grey on my head at age 12 lol
111crmb,"It‚Äôs Estradiol, checked. Good luck!"
111crmb,I didn‚Äôt even know it was a thing!! Turns out it was from wearing my sweaty gym thong too long after a workout. Now I gotta shower or at least change draws as soon as I‚Äôm finished working out
111crmb,Good luck! I always know when I‚Äôve had too much coffee because I can‚Äôt cook down and my face starts to melt!
111crmb,"The ocular migraine seems in my experience to be a 20 -30 minute annoyance of disturbed vision but no pain. And they are rare‚Äî more frequent when I‚Äôm overtired, over-caffeinated, and under-hydrated   Sadly I forget the degree to which those three contribute until, surprise, idiot, the trifecta strikes again!"
111crmb,"Indeed, there is quite the palette to choose from. Maybe a bright fuchsia or a lime green. Hehe."
111crmb,THAT would be interesting though! LOL.
111crmb,I did hot pink when i was young but that required bleaching first and I got a UTI from the bleach:(
111crmb,Ugh! I‚Äôm sorry. No fun. Did it at least look cool?
111crmb,Yes it did look cool haha
10ew42c,‚ÄúHide the knives‚Äù üíÄ
10ew42c,Yeah. I'm really feeling that knife longing today. It's not like I really want to be *dead* but I definitely don't want to be whatever the fuck this is right now.
10ew42c,Lol ü§£
10ew42c,"That is so cool. A lot of people don't think dads are too squeamish for that kind of talk, but some of them aren't. My dad and I had a similar discussion and it was lovely. Yay for understanding dads!"

10ew42c,"Thanks for that, and yeah. I know I'm not actually going to harm myself. I'm just..."
113nowx,"Hi there.

Do you suspect you are in peri ?"
113nowx,"Ask for full blood panel, Peri put me in deficit of a lot of vital minerals. Get iron checked, vitamin Bs and D plus your thyroid on top of hormones check. Deficiency of some of this nutrients affects mental health"
113nowx,Yes.
113nowx,There is no need or requirement to check hormone levels.
113nowx,"Okies - have you been tracking your symptoms across your cycles ?

The reason I say this is that when we are in peri, on any given day, our hormones can vary significantly and it will be sods law that the day you get your bloods done, it may well show you in the 'normal' range.

May well be a better to draw a larger picture for your doctors, physical and mental symptoms, bleeding patterns etc, say you think you are peri.

If you want bio identical HRT, ask then.

If they check you over and think something else is going on then follow through on that.

Be aware they may offer antidepressants - its a common experience across the board. If your mental symptoms are on and off over your cycle then its being driven by hormones so treat the hormones, if you've been feeling depressed consistenly over a period of time, AD's may be appropriate.

But to answer your question, I asked for a full hormone panel (blood test) to check what was going on. Mine were in the normal range of day of test despite being firmly in peri and having a miserable time of it.

I got offered AD's, I declined and pursued bio identical HRT and am feeling normal again !"
113nowx,"I asked my doctor to put in 2 separate orders to test hormones & thyroid. I went one day when I was feeling pretty decent, & a second time when my symptoms were really bad. 

Although she treats by symptoms because levels can widely fluctuate throughout the day, it at least gave her a baseline for what was going on when my symptoms were much worse.

Now, if I could get her to actually treat the symptoms properly since I have many more bad days than good, I might have a life again. 

AD‚Äôs did nothing, & in fact, the side numerous effects just added to my misery. I don‚Äôt understand why doctors think AD‚Äôs can fix a hormonal imbalance. SMH‚Ä¶"
113nowx,"Hmm. Ok, good info, thanks. The only thing I can actually ascribe to peri is that I've had a couple of months with two periods. I have other symptoms but I dontknow if they're peri or just ongoing symptoms of other medical and neurological conditions I have. I suppose I'll just have to wait and see."
113nowx,"Its the utter lack of education on peri and meno that drives it - its not actually mandatory for doctors to study it as part of their quals in the UK for example.

When they hand out ad's they think it will manage the emotional symptoms which will either get rid of the physical symptoms which are *obviously* exaggerated and / or an hysterical cry for help or they assume women have been doing this for centuries so blah blah blah put up with it.

Its outrageous.

I've said it a million times here before and am going there again: if men experienced this it would have been sorted decades ago and they would have hormones arriving in the post that they don't have to pay for bcos otherwise, who would run the world.

It grinds my gears ladies, it grinds my gears."
113nowx,"That happened to me. I went onto a 20 day cycle after my second kid - I was 35 when he was born and by 38 I was desperate for help- went to gp, was offered antidepressants. Skip forward four years and I am now on a combination pill (150mg progesterone/ 30mg estrogen) and I am going to have to ask for more estrogen because of the hot flashes. It‚Äôs only with hindsight that I realise it was peri all along which made me go to a 20 day cycle. Best way to get help from medical professionals is to bring a list of symptoms. Good luck ü§û"
113nowx,Please see our wiki for a list of [symptoms.](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)..
113nowx,Thanks! I'm mid 50s and just hoping I'll be done soon...lol
113nowx,"*Mhmmmmm, take your time.*"
10r63xh,"The sooner you start localized estrogen, the better and it is highly effective. Take a look at our Wiki for trreatment options.  This may help with UTI's etc. 

Also know that a family history of breast cancer does not prevent you from MHT/HRT.  Dr. Jen Gunter (author of *The Menopause Manifesto*) and other doctors agree that MHT is an option **if you, yourself** have not had breast cancer.  

Again check out our Wiki for the NAMs site to find a menopause practitioner near you (it is hit and miss finding a good doctor even through a menopause society, but it's a good starting point)."
10r63xh,Same gurl! There‚Äôs a fairly new product out (I think it‚Äôs new) called IntraRosa that doesn‚Äôt technically have estrogen in it.  It has dhea. You put it up your vag at night and it helps restore the tissue. My gyno said it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgamechanger‚Äù‚Äî and she doesn‚Äôt use that word for anything. I just got a script but my pharmacy had to check my insurance to see if it‚Äôs covered.
10r63xh,"Feeling significantly relieved, both to hear there are non-hormonal options and that at least maybe the vaginal hormones could at least be an option.  Thank you both!

I‚Äôm still kinda mad though that I was blindsided by this.  WHY WASN‚ÄôT I TOLD this happens?  You think if men‚Äôs penises shriveled up after 50 everyone would be hush hush about it?  Society, fellow women, you failed to prepare me!! üò©"
10r63xh,"My mother also died of breast cancer. I am on HRT, as is my sister. I am on .06 estradiol patches (weekly) and 100 mg micronized progesterone at night. 

I know it's weird doing a complete about face on what we all knew as Truth about HRT and BC, but I was happy to know it's a valid option. 

No agenda here, I get it if you opt out, but I'm glad you're learning what your choices are so you can make an informed decision.  Good luck."
10r63xh,"Find a doctor you trust. Do your research. Advocate for yourself. There no reason to suffer. Best of luck. I think HRT gets a bad wrap. It‚Äôs not for everyone, but for those who can take it and need it - it can be life changing."
10r63xh,Have a look into Vagifem-Low
10r63xh,"Run, don‚Äôt walk, to get vaginal estrogen cream and put it everywhere inside and out. You can return to being supple and healthy and get rid of uti‚Äôs"
10r63xh,"How long did it take to do that? I've been using vag. estrogen (0.5 grams per night) for 2 weeks and I'm soooo impatient for it to start doing something. It's helped a tiny bit, but not enough."
10r63xh,I think I did 1.0 or 1.5 for two weeks and then tapered to .5 twice a week
10r63xh,"That's great to know, thank you!"
10u2bi4,"Because....vaginal atrophy, experienced by roughly 80% of women in menopause.  Please see our Menopause Wiki, particularly the section [What about that vaginal dryness and shrinkage?](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_what_about_that_vaginal_dryness_and_shrinkage.3F)"
10u2bi4,"Estrogen vaginal cream will fix you up, don't worry!!! It's what sent me to the gyn the first time for any kind of peri treatment and I have completely razor blade free sex now. 

Thankfully this particular issue is one of the reversible, treatable, fixable parts of this roller coaster!!"
10u2bi4,Vaginal Estradiol cream 2x/week and plenty of lube during sex.
10u2bi4,Yep and the d#ck is made out of sandpaper. I use estridiol cream (estrogen) there is also inserts like imvexxy and other brands. Builds the tissues back up to be less fragile due to lack of estrogen.
10u2bi4,Until we found a good silicone lube yes it burns for me more than hurts.  But we had to go to an adult shop to talk with the clerks.  They understood and had lots of suggestions for which lines to use during which part of this journey I was in.  They also suggested a clitoral massager to help stimulate things.  I can‚Äôt remember the brand I got right now but it has worked like a charm and no more burning.
10u2bi4,Try the hyoluronic acid lube. It's super nourishing for dry thin tissue
10u2bi4,"My sister experienced this exact sensation. Her doc told her she was basically shredding her vagina during sex because the skin in there was thinning out and she wasn't producing enough natural lube, but she also had mild spotting (because of the shredded skin). I hope you can find the cause of this and get some help and relief...‚ù§Ô∏è"
10u2bi4,"I have been using Imvexxy for 2 years now (vaginal estrogen suppository) and it's a total game changer.

However, I am now feeling dry, itchy, UTI like symptoms (with a negative UTI test) and have been told that topical cream, in addition to the suppositories, works really well. It's like every part between my legs needs a good moisturizing!!"
10u2bi4,"Hrt fixed it for us, and our sex life is back to normal"
10u2bi4,"Chiming in along with the others to say, nope, not just you. ü•∫ that said, holy crap, I don‚Äôt think i would have described it like razor blades; it sounds multiple times worse for you. 

And that‚Äôs with lube you said! I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs so painful. Definitely get it checked out and get relief! One of my older sisters had it really bad too and she uses an intravaginal ring that secretes estrogen (It‚Äôs likely the Estring or something similar). It pretty much solved it for her. 

Good luck!!"

10u2bi4,Ouchhhhhhhh.
10lt7tb,"The last time someone in their 20s called me a Karen, I responded, ""OK, Edgelord"" which appeared to really piss him off."

10lt7tb,"Somewhat related: I once did an evaluation survey report for work after our annual conference. I noticed that 30% of survey female names were Karen, from all walks of life (ethnicities, age, race). It‚Äôs a really common name in general. 

Related: anytime someone tries to offend you, ask a question back to regain your power. Questions always force the other person to explain themselves. Stay patient and try to form a question:
- Is there someone else who can help me? 
- How does calling me Karen help this situation? 
- Why did you just call me that, when I just need your help?"
10lt7tb,"I find the Karen thing to be so sexist. One of my neighbors, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúSteve,‚Äù made a comment on Facebook about ‚ÄúHey, for you Karens out there calling the police, those are fireworks, not guns.‚Äù I wanted to reply, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the male equivalent of Karen? How about Steve?‚Äù"
10lt7tb,Is there an adult I could ask instead? In a super polite pleasant voice.
10lt7tb,"If this happened to me, I would say ""hey, if you're gonna Karen me, I'm gonna play the part"" and find the manager.  And make damn sure the manager knows that the employee not only doesn't know where anything is, they won't help you find it when you ask. And I can't buy what I can't find."
10lt7tb,I hate this. It's like no one can have a legitimate complaint anymore.
10lt7tb,"I like responding with the blank 5 second stare, personally."
10lt7tb,"Man, try *actually* being named Karen. I'm scared to give my real name for takeout orders!"
10lt7tb,"This Karen thing has always been a misogynistic way to shut down any grievance a woman might have, particularly middle aged women.It's especially insidious because a lot of women are on board with it too. I'm not sure what the best response to this is but I think I'd lean towards no response like others are saying."
10lt7tb,My response: Anyone who uses the name Karen as an insult is an asshole.
10lt7tb,"Well, now I get to practice my Karen-ing. My vacuum died last week and it was under warranty, so (*they think*) they're replacing it with one 1/3 the original cost.

10lt7tb,[deleted]
10lt7tb,"Its hard at the time of surprise to respond with a comeback. But after thinking on it if I could think of one it would be to play dumb about knowing what a karen is. ""You must be confused (hun or sweetie), my name is Ms or Mrs So and So. Now,, ""(back to issue at hand) I probably came up with this because I just binge watched Desperate Housewives lol."
10lt7tb,"Say, OK Chad"
10lt7tb,"I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄòKaren‚Äô move, but this one is.‚Äù Then I‚Äôd complain to a manager about his shitty attitude. 

It‚Äôs bad enough that all of the ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù of the world have had their name hijacked, but I find it even more obnoxious when it is used incorrectly."
10lt7tb,"As someone who works retail, it can stretch my soul very thin. A reasonable complaint with no exasperation, sarcasm, accusations, or power games does not make someone a Karen. Complaints with any of the four characteristics above can wear a person down. A little patience and empathy will usually help to get an underpaid and overworked human being to be on your side. If you asked a question out of true curiosity then you are not a Karen. Everything has changed since Covid as far as retail goes, its a lot easier to become frustrated, and there are a lot more impatient customers than before. Not saying that's you. You deserve just as much respect as workers do."
10lt7tb,"I am outspoken and confrontational and I would have lit that person up.  Ok - look at name tag - Bob.  You‚Äôre not helpful.  I‚Äôm sure you have a manager somewhere - so like all good KARENS do ,, let‚Äôs go have a chat with them.  And then tell the manager that the unexplainable rudeness of that person and how you are certain that XYZ grocery chain surely does not approve of name calling and crap service so what are they going to do about it ???? üëÄ"
10lt7tb,‚ÄúLook here you little shit‚Äù might be a good retort
10lt7tb,Sorry to be a bother. I‚Äôll just ask the store manager to help me. Have a good day pencil dick. üòè
10lt7tb,I'm so tired of the Karen shit.  Just another way to take power away from women.  It's even more sad when women do it to other women.
10lt7tb,"You think I‚Äôm a Karen now? Since I‚Äôm already fucked, I might as well lean into it. I need to speak with your supervisor then, and tell them that their employee is basically calling their customer a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù right to her face. 

You made a big mistake, because you have no idea how big of a bitch I can be. You messed with the wrong person. 

You. Are. Fucked."
10lt7tb,‚ÄúBless your little heart‚Äù is the Southern ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù.
10lt7tb,"*pause and stare, looking slightly perplexed* ‚ÄúExcuse me? My name isn‚Äôt Karen. Why would you call me that?‚Äù"
10lt7tb,"As a very old millenial (pushing 42) I just want to say that I really don't understand the age group that I've been lumped into. I often just say I'm part of the ""Oregon Trail"" generation. I'm the little sister of the GenX folks, born the same year that MTV came into our lives. So all I've ever known were boomer parents, GenX siblings, and grandparents who lived through the Depression. 

To answer your question: just go full ""Karen"" and report any person who says that to you. It's rude, regardless and should be reported. And if this occurs outside of a business, I'm with the top comment: Anyone can be an asshole. So go with that. (""Dipshit"" works, too.)"
10lt7tb,"I might say, very calmly, ‚ÄúI hope that makes you feel good about yourself. Now, can you help me find this item?‚Äù"
10lt7tb,Pull a reverse Karen and yell my name is NERAK!
10lt7tb,People are so unjustly rude
10lt7tb,Fuck you?
10lt7tb,"Really? Karen? Oh so creative you little cockwaffle. Try harder, Karen is played out and has been, dullard."
10lt7tb,My response: ok Zoomer.
10lt7tb,"Well he used it incorrectly. When I Karen, you‚Äôll know it."
10lt7tb,"I think I would have laughed honestly, and then I would have questioned myself ‚Äúam I being unreasonable? Is my behavior a bit extreme?‚Äù If the answer is yes, I would acknowledge it and apologize and try to take a different tone. If the answer is no, then I would think ‚Äúdoes this person know what a Karen is? Or maybe they just really wanted an excuse to say that?‚Äù Either way, it really doesn‚Äôt have to affect me. 

We have enough shit to deal with and I know there are times where I‚Äôm erratic or a total raging bitch, I do my best not to blow up when I get annoyed and I try really hard to be respectful of everyone because we‚Äôre all going through something, but sometimes I find myself getting super short and just huffy - heavy sighs, eye rolls, hands tossed in the air like I‚Äôm signaling to the heavens to please just take me now because I can‚Äôt deal with this bullshit any longer. 

If someone catches me at a bad time acting unreasonable and as though the world is supposed to serve me everything on a silver platter simply because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old‚Äù then I guess letting me know with this line would be great feedback. If I‚Äôm not acting that way and I‚Äôve been nothing but polite, meh, I can‚Äôt be bothered, I‚Äôm just trying to make it through the day.


Edit: I just wanted to put this all more concisely, I think of it like any other thing that could be considered an insult:

Is this something that I feel is or might be true about me? 

-> If yes, then is it something I feel like I want to fix? 
      -> If yes, then make the adjustment

-> otherwise, let it go

No need to hang on to someone else‚Äôs drama, and I know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but it‚Äôs what I strive for."
10lt7tb,Rather be a Karen than an horses ass?
10lt7tb,"Something like ""I may have missed it when I looked there, would you show me where it is in that section?"" is a better response. We've all DONE that, assuredly. Retail is worse than ever and we've all seen how management and customers treat these folks. Everyone is walking around with a hair trigger. 

As far as a response to ""Ok, Karen"" type stuff try something like - ""Okay, let's start over, it's been a rough day for both of us - I'm looking for Product X. I tried the section you mentioned, as well as a few others. I may be glossing over it as I'm a bit tired and overwhelmed, so I would really appreciate your help in pointing out where in the section it is."" 

Fwiw, I can never find rice flour and have to go through the - nope, not in flour. Not in flour alternatives. Not in healthy choices, not in ethnic foods, etc. Turns out, it was hiding in the keto section. 

Also, admittedly - I get super frustrated and give up easily, as I get hot flashes when shopping."
10lt7tb,I demand to speak to your manager!
10lt7tb,"I act like I have no idea what they are referencing.  ""I'm sorry, I don't understand, my name's Maria."""
10lt7tb,[deleted]
10lt7tb,"I feel like the best response is to entirely ignore it. Most people are trying to get a laugh when they say crap like this and if no one laughs or acknowledges what they're saying, they'll eventually stop saying it. There's nothing worse than thinking you're so clever only to realized no one around you agrees with you! Let them do it a few times and continue to get no response and they'll think of something less lazy next time.

Are there legitimate jerks who overstep their bounds and feel entitled to special treatment? Yes. But there are also legitimate reasons for adult women to be angry and speak up at a certain stage in their lives and this juvenile insult is really a way to get all of us to shut up, regardless. I choose to ignore it and keep fucking talking."
10lt7tb,No response is the best response. Real ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù always feel the need to respond.
10lt7tb,‚ÄúKaren is about to kick your a**‚Äù might get their attention.
10lt7tb,Thanks Karen! Accompanied by an extra big grin üòÅ
10lt7tb,‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right asshole. Don‚Äôt make me unleash the karen cos you won‚Äôt be able to handle it!‚Äù
10lt7tb,"Hey bud. Let's step back. I'm not trying to cause any static. I'm just trying to get what I paid for. If that's an issue or simply the timing is bad I totally understand. I'd just, and 100% respectfully just like to ask about the return process so I can get this product or service elsewhere.

Customer service is a shit job and even the best of them have bad days. There's no need to add your own emotions onto of there's and there's no need to call anyone out. Just makes a bigger fire. But you can still salvage the relationship and you must if you are to get what you want."
10lt7tb,Ok limp dick or if they r younger it can be ok future limp dick.  Let‚Äôs workshop this.  We will get the right response.
10lt7tb,True Karens stand in empty parking spots and always need the last word.

10lt7tb,"I'm Gen X and ""whatever"" with an eye roll always fits the snark coming from the whipper snappers. Add an eye roll or report them to their managers."
10lt7tb,"I might say (in a voice that‚Äôs too sweet):

‚ÄúOh, honey, you must have me confused with someone else you know. That‚Äôs not my name. My name is [insert here].‚Äù And then just stare a laser beam through their face, silently, and see what they do with that. 

Variations on that include: 

‚ÄúOh honey, you must have me confused with your mom. That‚Äôs not my name. My name is [insert name].‚Äù {silent stare}

AND:

 ‚ÄúOh honey, you must have me confused with someone else. That‚Äôs not my name. My name is [Bad Motherfucker (if you want to tip your hat to Jules in ‚ÄúPulp Fiction,‚Äù) or any other clever name/reference you choose]‚Äù {continue with silent stare}"

10lt7tb,"I‚Äôm with you‚Ä¶ some young arse in the post office called me a Boomer a few months back, (I‚Äôm Gen X, and will eat a man whole and you won‚Äôt find the bones), I turned around, walked up to him and flicked him hard in the forehead, and said really loud, what was that you called me? Right up tight to his nose. He was so shocked an old broad like me actually took him on. His mates all pointed at him and laughed‚Ä¶ I could feel his little dick shrivelling as I stood there.  The lady behind the counter clapped.  It was glorious. I hoped that bruise I gave him came up good and purple."
10lt7tb,"Great responses! I need you in my head, I am unprepared for human interactions. Nice advice."
10lt7tb,"I forgot about this. This is my favourite kind of approach. It‚Äôs a low energy, high reward action that is not offensive or confrontational yet calls out shitty behaviour by shifting attention to it. Great for racist/homophobic etc comments and jokes too."
10lt7tb,"And just playing dumb can be fun. ""Karen? My name is Sarah; what's yours?"""
10lt7tb,This is a perfect way to respond.

10lt7tb,"I was thinking the same thing! ‚ÄúCool, you want a Karen? I can give you a Karen, you little shit.‚Äù"
10lt7tb,"And let the manager know you were going to make a purchase but that staff member lost them a sale. 

Don‚Äôt bother engaging with shitty staff. Not worth engaging with their toxicity - let them explain themselves to their BOSS"
10lt7tb,"Haha. Yes, go full ""Karen"" on them. 

I started asking to speak to the manager long before it was a meme, and that was because I was being ignored or hit on in music instrument stores. I figured that the manager had more at stake and had more training than a front line employee."
10lt7tb,This is a good approach. I'd include making sure that the manager knows that the employee is insulting customers.
10lt7tb,Only tangentially related: I once asked a supermarket employee where the barley was. Poor kid didn't even know what barley is.
10lt7tb,"100%. If it‚Äôs in a workplace, a five second stare of silence followed by ‚ÄúGet me your manager.‚Äù"
10lt7tb,The whole Karen thing is deeply misogynistic.
10lt7tb,"Not 'no one', women.
Karen is made to dismiss women, especially middle aged and older women, as if we weren't already invisible enough..."
10lt7tb,Not if you're a woman! Of course not.
10lt7tb,Exactly. If some idiot is not doing their job and you call them out for it you are labeled the racist term Karen. People do not want to complain anymore
10lt7tb,"And retail employees don't work, they just stand around and talk to each other. I walked up to an employee who was talking with another employee, she turned to me, started mouthing off to me, (cuss words) when I asked, ""excuse me?"" she replied, ""Just multi-tasking."" In other words, answering to her friend, while staring me in the eye. I should have said, ""Well how's that multi-tasking working out for you?"" and communicated her exact words to her manager. 

But... I was so taken aback I only thought of this reply after it was too late. Oh, and this 20 something employee was trying to convince me that I am a different size than I know I am because I've been buying that brand before she was even born. Yeah, I'm still pissed, more at myself for not handling her differently."
10lt7tb,"I like to do the stare for about 3 seconds, blink, and then just state, ""wow. That was really rude."" And then wait for them to react."
10lt7tb,This is how I handled my children's smart ass comments. It made their blood run cold. Lol
10lt7tb,That‚Äôs hardcore.   I Like.
10lt7tb,Whatever happened to calling an asshole an asshole?  People want to use someone else's name so they don't associate themselves with the insult.
10lt7tb,Me too!
10lt7tb,"Same here. I actually considered changing my name during college, because I've always hated it, but could never decide on what to change it to, and now I really regret not doing it."
10lt7tb,Use Katherine instead! üòÅ
10lt7tb,I‚Äôve given up and started using a nickname :(
10lt7tb,"[Not quite.](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/14/891177904/whats-in-a-karen). ""Karen"" originated as a term in black American culture to refer to women who use the structures of white supremacy to control black people."
10lt7tb,"It hasn't always been, and it isn't always now. But I see this too, and I'm frustrated by it, because for many people, it HAS become a way to shut down women with legitimate concerns.   


But I don't know how to acknowledge the racist part while pushing back against the misogynistic part."

10lt7tb,I do like saying OK Boomer to fellow Xers when they‚Äôre being boomery.

10lt7tb,"Don't use the Incel term for good-looking guy.

He will be flattered."
10lt7tb,"When I have a complaint or even just a customer service issue, I start nice and go from there. What usually happens is the employee is pleasantly surprised that I'm being nice and the matter gets sorted quickly.

And I'm pretty sure that when it's not, it's usually a structural issue\* and not the employee's fault.

\*Namely, the people who set company policy and procedure are never the people that have to deal with the customers."
10lt7tb,Oh I saw true fear on the face of the poor kid I asked in the garden center about the potting soil up on the top pallets.  I quickly reassured him it was fine.  It was Sunday. Their forklift operator was off.  And it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world.  He helped me load the more expensive stuff from down low.  Strangely I have so much more patience and understanding with everyone now than when I was younger.  I dread being called  a Karen.  Ok Boomer and Ok Karen have become ways of dismissing anything from us.  I‚Äôm genX!  I don‚Äôt feel old.  And I‚Äôm not a mean old lady.  Ugh.

10lt7tb,"I‚Äôm 43 this year and I call myself an Xennial.

10lt7tb,"If she was rude and getting pushback, then that‚Äôs another story, but she wasn‚Äôt.

10lt7tb,"I was out the other day and had a less than great experience taking my kids out for a treat at an indoor playground.

I was saying to them don‚Äôt worry and I‚Äôd make sure it was fixed. My son just says ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt fix it, are you gonna go full Karen?‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyep, mummy will go full Karen if I have to.‚Äù 

I never start out in Karen mode, but if you are screwing me over I‚Äôm not afraid to live up to a stereotype."
10lt7tb,"Well, I can‚Äôt speak for not knowing what barley is but I used to be a produce manager and I can tell you for sure that most people who work in supermarkets work in different departments and there‚Äôs almost no way a produce or deli employee, or a cashier would know where the barley is. Additionally, a LOT of larger grocery stores have contracts with companies who stock their own product. Seltzer, bread, chips, and health and beauty are common ones and there‚Äôs probably more (I‚Äôm not 100% sure because I was in produce!). So if you ask any of those folks, they won‚Äôt know either.

Finally, these young people only know what we teach them. If these kids don‚Äôt know what barley is, or an avocado, it‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt taught. And, many young kids working in grocery stores haven‚Äôt actually had to do grocery shopping yet, so they don‚Äôt have an innate sense of what is grouped with what."
10lt7tb,"Cashiers regularly ask me what various vegetables are. Like, an avocado."
10lt7tb,Yes we are to be barely seen and NEVER heard.
10lt7tb,Never could. Calling us Karens is just misogyny‚Äôs newest flavor.

10lt7tb,"Screw that. 


Well. Guess I should just legally change my name then ü§£"
10lt7tb,"For those who downvoted your post, I get the hesitance in calling this racism but it is, at the very least, racial. As another poster excellently put it elsewhere on this post, ‚Äú‚ÄòKaren‚Äô originated as a term in black American culture to refer to women who use the structures of white supremacy to control black people.‚Äù

I recently was called a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù for the first time ever, by a younger African American woman for not letting her cut ahead of me in line. If she had just asked to cut, I would have been fine with it but she didn‚Äôt ask. When I said, ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she turned around and responded, ‚ÄúYou are a Karen.‚Äù

I told her that was an odd insult, as I‚Äôm actually Latina, and most people can tell that that I am. To my surprise, that shut her up."
10lt7tb,"Ageist and/or sexist is probably more applicable than racist, but I get what you mean."
10lt7tb,"You actually do sound like a Karen, though. You don't seem to see ""retail workers"" as human. Very below you. ""They don't work,"" etc. Very bad vibe."
10lt7tb,I don‚Äôt have the energy to do the self reflecting for them lmao let them figure out they‚Äôre being rude
10lt7tb,Blinking while holding eye contact is like icing on top
10lt7tb,Fascinating!  Thanks.
10lt7tb,"Exactly. People act like this issue of white women using their power to manipulate and punish people  isnt real. In fact, it's such a serious issue that the nickname has popped up, Karen. 

Degrading retail workers and trying to get people  *fired* from their extremely stressful customer service jobs is a major problem. Learn some coping mechanisms and practice a little patience."
10lt7tb,"The white people using ""Karen"" now aren't victims of systemic racism or white supremacy."
10lt7tb,Fascinating!  Thanks.
10lt7tb,"Thank you for saying this.  It isn't misogynistic in it's origin, but has been turned into that by pop culture and internet memes.  If you are being called a Karen, you should reflect on whether or not your demands, manners or approach to the other person are rooted in white privilege.  This includes butting into situations that have nothing to do with you personally.  You are not the savior of the world or protector of the universe.  Butt out.    If someone calls you a Karen to disregard a legitimate request you have regarding a service they provided in a manner that was delivered in a less than satisfactory way, then handle it like an adult or risk being called a ""Karen."" In that sense, it basically means you are acting like a difficult child (IMO), and/or also a perceived ""bitch"" and that is where ""Karen"" is used misogynistically.  Men can make the same requests firmly and get a lot further than a female making a request firmly, but a female screaming and carrying on and acting out of control will be immediately disregarded.  It just is the way it is.  {Edit: ‚ÄúYou‚Äù mean generally, not directed at OP}"
10lt7tb,Nah I'm 50 and I'll call a boomer acting like the good old days of beating the shit out of kids and women living in the kitchen were just fine a boomer in a second.
10lt7tb,1000%. Worked retail and as a receptionist and anyone who was nice got the best I could give them.
10lt7tb,"You are one of the good ones, fellow introvert."
10lt7tb,"I've worked in customer service, fortunately 99% of the time only over the phone, but it still taught me a lot.  
I would bend over backwards for my friendly and nice and awesome customers, and they had my back in return when needed. I would do my job to the best of my abilities for the regular customers, who treated me like a neutral party who could help them with their problems. And I told the worst one to calm down and call again when they were able to behave and not swear and shout at my coworker, then slammed the phone down - in front of my boss who happened to walk past. *

The point is most of the time you get what you put in. If you, as a customer, are nice and friendly, you will receive nice and friendly service. If you behave like a spoiled brat you risk ending up on some Reddit for people to laugh at.


* ETA: Nothing happened to me, my boss knew me well enough to realize I wouldn't have slammed the phone down without *very* good reason. The customer called back 10 minutes later, calm and willing to let me help them. We fixed the problem and if any complaints were made, I never heard of it."
10lt7tb,"While it wasn't always the case, I'm pretty sure ""ok, boomer"" directed at gen-x is meant to call you old. Sneaky zoomers, pretending they don't know gen-x exists."
10lt7tb,Lots of Gen X didn't marry or have kids early. I'm almost 50 and half of my friend group never married at all. And almost all those who DID have kids did so from their mid-30s to mid-40s.
10lt7tb,"This. I‚Äôm a boomer on the cusp of gen x , not fully one or the other. One day I walked up the the manager stand at Trader Joe‚Äôs and as I walked up, I could see the look on the managers face‚Äîoh god here comes a Karen. I immediately wanted to apologize to him for thinking I was a Karen, when all I wanted to know if the California olive oil was discontinued. It as kinda funny, I did tell him‚Äîsee I wasn‚Äôt a Karen after all."
10lt7tb,"Thank you. You can tell I regularly have trouble finding things in stores and have done the dance before. 

We relocated across the US Spring 2022 and I'm STRUGGLING at these grocery stores because I have to go to 4 different ones to get all the food replacement stuff I need (food allergies to corn, potatoes, soy and eggs). 

There's something about grocery stores that give me horrible hot flashes, which makes the whole thing so much more frustrating. I get dizzy AF and there's almost never chairs to sit down and recover in anymore. 

Today I went to TWO grocery stores - one to get zucchini fries (super yummy) and another to get my regular groceries."
10lt7tb,Yea f that employee. Sorry for their shit day but that situation didn't warrant that comment.
10lt7tb,Then laugh at them and go about your day. Still don't have to dump your emotions on the fire.
10lt7tb,"I appreciate this lesson so much. From now on, if I get inappropriately ‚ÄúOk Karen‚Äù-ed I‚Äôm going to eyeball them and depending on my inappropriate judgement (just like theirs) based on looks alone, I will either respond with (not gender-dependent):

‚ÄúOk edgelord.‚Äù (for someone who tries-too-hard-to-be-different)

Or 

‚ÄúOk Dick.‚Äù (not the above, just a run-of-the-mill dick. And if they try to get me in trouble for profanity, I can just say ‚ÄúDick‚Äôs a name, just like Karen.‚Äù Problem solved)."
10lt7tb,I get it. I like it and gonna keep it in my repertoire

10lt7tb,"I was born in 1963 and I graduated in 1981 during an economic meltdown. There were no jobs and no money. I have struggled all my life and I have worked 60+ hour weeks just so my son and I wouldn't starve. I went through economic crises one after another over and over again and had to spend the paltry amount I had in my 401K after I was laid off time after time. The Reagan administration made this all possible and I was of the first generation affected by this.

I will never retire. I will be that old woman at Walmart or Target stocking shelves wearing my Depends and walking with a cane. 

""Boomer"" is meant to divide us. Looks like it worked. So fucking sick of being blamed for something that took away any security from me too."
10lt7tb,46 year old Gen Xer concurs.
10lt7tb,"I'm finding that to young people, we're lumped in with them. Drives me up the wall."
10lt7tb,20+ years in retail have proven to me that the hippie boomers are the worst kind of boomers.
10lt7tb,"So I guess you are well acquainted with every single one of the approximately 70 million boomers and 65 million gen Xers alive today? Sheesh. As I noted, above, generational wars are absolutely idiotic. 

Do you relate really well to, say, Ted Cruz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Brett Kavanaugh or Ron Desantis? They are all Gen Xers.

Every generation has wonderful and horrible people. But there's nothing more mind-numbing than listening to people rag on the generations above and below them. It makes no sense."
10lt7tb,"This is both true and the correct way to handle it and also he would only look sad if he tried to press charges.

I'm not saying its ok and I don't think it's something I would do, but IDK, sometimes you got to flick a young and impetuous man on the forehead to get their attention. I can guarantee he won't forget anytime soon.

Not supporting this exactly, but it's done and it's hilarious."
10lt7tb,"I agree -- this whole thread seems kind of insane. No, it's not cool to flick a stranger on the forehead or to touch someone you don't know in any way. It's a bit deranged, actually. This woman probably is some kind of a raging asshole."
10lt7tb,"assaulting a federal employee while they're on the job, no less. but yeah he earned it"
10lt7tb,"I'm always amazed by the amount of shit women are expected to blow off, be the bigger person, not stoop to their level, blah blah. Doesn't matter if someone groped us, molested us, was moderately rude or kicked our dog. 

Yeah, it's assault. Yeah, it's illegal. So is verbal harassment. When men half my age are squaring up to fight me because I didn't back down when defending my self or property, a clever quip isn't going to do a damned thing. They don't even see women as human. They need their asses handed to them a lot more often."
10lt7tb,"I think 55 is solidly gen-x, right? 1965-1980 is the most common range I see."
10lt7tb,Me too; I‚Äôm 59 and technically a Boomer but I‚Äôm Gen X in my heart and soul.
10lt7tb,"Generational wars are really dumb, though. There are great and horrible people in every generation. There are some fantastic boomers and horrifyingly awful Gen Xers. When you were born is not something you can control, so it's super weird to be either PROUD of it or ASHAMED of it. It's utterly meaningless."
10lt7tb,Only if he admits he was taken down by a 50 something year old woman.  I‚Äôd a happily taken the charges. Was totally worth it.
10lt7tb,"No because ""Chad"" is an Incel name for an attractive young man,

""Chad and Stacy"" is the name an Incel gives to perfect couples that he will never be a part of.

I'm particularly triggered by that Incel terminology because I knew someone who died in this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\_Toronto\_van\_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Toronto_van_attack)

These dudes are crazy as fuck."
10lt7tb,He must be a unicorn ü¶Ñ I‚Äôve never even heard of a real person named chad.
10lt7tb,"If I do a grocery shop *without* playing ""What's this vegetable?"", I feel like I did it wrong."
10lt7tb,Oh I'll make absolutely sure they'll hear me alright. I can get quite loud when I want to. Embarrass the little runt in front of all his buddies.
10lt7tb,This is why I never used the term. It quickly became a way to shut women down if they spoke up about anything.
10lt7tb,"It‚Äôs the same as calling a woman a bitch or cunt, but you can hide behind calling someone a Karen instead."
10lt7tb,Fwiw every Karen I've ever known in real life has been genuinely sweet and pleasant.  I love Karens.
10lt7tb,"Karen originally came about because of white women calling the police on black folk for living in public, like the woman who called NYC police on a POC birdwatcher.

It evolved a lot from there because so many people wanted to have a justifiable reason to call older women names."
10lt7tb,"I was in the service industry for 20 yrs, lol. When I see a group of employees shooting the shit on the sales floor of a busy store, instead of helping customers, that means they are not doing the job that they are being paid to do. There‚Äôs a break room for that. And when a sales associate breaks the 4th wall and uses the word ‚Äúmutherfucker‚Äù to a customer and claims she‚Äôs multitasking, as a manager, I would fire her on the spot. But okay, call me Karen."
10lt7tb,I find that the simple bluntness of the statement really catches them off guard most times. It works pretty well in a lot of situations.
10lt7tb,"Just to be clear here, there was no degrading of CS staff or trying to get anyone fired."
10lt7tb,"Indeed. 

I was responding to the *""has always been""* part of the statement."
10lt7tb,"It can be a class thing, though. Unfortunately there is not an insignificant amount of middle and upper-middle-class Gen X white women who look down on retail workers and other ""help."" I've known some -- for example, those who are rude to wait staff. It's horrible."
10lt7tb,"You are making an awful lot of assumptions and generalizations here. Maybe the OP lacks self-awareness about her sense of entitlement, maybe not. Maybe the kid was being an asshole. Point is we don‚Äôt know."
10lt7tb,"If only more people would be just ... nice!

I am frequently very irritated when the store I always shop at is out of half the things I went there to buy.  But I know it's not the worker's fault!  Sometimes I ask if a certain product has been moved, or if they have discontinued it, or maybe they are just temporarily out of it?  And when the worker doesn't even know the answer, I kind of boil inside.

But I just say something like: It's ok, I know times are hard.""  With a smile.

IT DOESN'T KILL YOU TO BE NICE!"
10lt7tb,I hate grocery stores with a passion! I‚Äôve had a full blown panic attack on the spice isle once and had to leave. The stock and staffing issues since Covid have just made it all that much worse.
10lt7tb,Often applied to 12 year olds who are looking to shock and awe their elders on the interwebz.
10lt7tb,"Technically, I think you are classified as Boomer 2, or (imo better known as) Generation Jones."
10lt7tb,I‚Äôm a geriatric millennial (LOL) and my 14 year old son calls me boomer all the time.  I cal him ‚Äúzoomer‚Äù and take away his video games.
10lt7tb,[deleted]
10lt7tb,"Getting downvoted because people actually LIKE generational wars? You WANT to keep fighting the generations above and below you??! This is a constructive and smart way to go about life, is it?

LOL. Oh, man, this is some sad, sad shit."
10lt7tb,We don‚Äôt acknowledge that type of trash as one of our own.
10lt7tb,[deleted]
10lt7tb,"She said she flicked him ""hard"" and hopes he developed a large bruise from it. I'm sorry, that is deranged, and all the people ""liking"" that story -- would you actually do that?? Come on. It's bizarre behavior."
10lt7tb,He wouldn't look that sad. A cop once told me you can press assault charges even if someone just touches your arm.
10lt7tb,Yup. And also nobody clapped. I‚Äôm very assertive and always speak my mind but I know how to talk to service workers (like they are people and have feelings) so I‚Äôm never afraid of being called a Karen. Also flicking people? We learned to keep our hands to ourselves in nursery school.
10lt7tb,"""I could feel his little dick shrivelling"" and ""I hope the bruise I gave him comes up nice and purple""

She sounds like a complete asshole. Makes me wonder why she was called a boomer if that was her overreaction."
10lt7tb,55 is about as Gen x as can be!
10lt7tb,Depends on what you read. I‚Äôm 1980 so considered Genx some places and elder millennial in others..
10lt7tb,"Oh Lord, I'm right on the edge. I'm 56 in 3 days. Yikes."
10lt7tb,"To 1981. Thank god, I made the cut."
10lt7tb,"I think this is more common in the US although through powers of social media and the world's desire to label things up, it's picking up in the UK.

The Karen thing is used here although other names get thrown in too lol.  If someone called me a Karen I'd just laugh and say: ""Menopausal Mary actually, we're worse than Karen's,.....don't mess with us!"" give them a wink or flick the bird if they're absolutely pricks about it."
10lt7tb,Thank you!
10lt7tb,"What's the back story for why he called you ""boomer"" in the first place? You're leaving a whole lot out of this story."
10lt7tb,Lol... Here I thought it was Barbie & Ken ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
10lt7tb,Hmm. They‚Äôre around where I live. I went on a few dates with one about 20 years ago. He was ok
10lt7tb,"This 100%. I have been trying to explain this to my 14 year old daughter. I asked her if she wanted me to speak to her teacher about something and she said ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want you to be a Karen,‚Äù when it was totally a legitimate concern. 

I do know there are TikTok videos out there of women totally losing their s**t over something very trivial, but to make this a general term any time a woman speaker up or advocates for herself is wrong."
10lt7tb,"My sophomore roommate Karen was awesome. Once we put on our winter hats with pompoms and jumped around to Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" to work off finals stress. üòÉ"
10lt7tb,Same here.
10lt7tb,"No it didn‚Äôt. In 2005 Dane Cook started the Karen trend with a bit in his comedy routine about a friend named Karen that no one liked. Then in 2017, a Redditor posted about his wife Karen who was pushy, mean and entitled and the thread gained a huge amount of popularity. It was in 2018 when the name got attributed to race, more specifically white women and their racially biased police reporting."
10lt7tb,"I know the origin. Unfortunately, the general masses have adapted the saying and twisted it to fit their own agendas."
10lt7tb,"If you look up the truth on the POC birdwatcher, he was an absolute asshole who was legitimately scaring her on purpose. He edited the video to make him look innocent and her look awful. She lost her job, her dog, and had to literally move out of the country due to the harassment she received. 
I take all those videos with a grain of salt. Editing is everything."
10lt7tb,Check out the other comments. Plenty of people in here are calling for you to go to the manager and get them in trouble. It's not an unusual occurrence.
10lt7tb,Picking on people who are just doing their job is just rude whomever is doing it.
10lt7tb,"I was not assuming this on OP. Should have made that clear. I was adding to the comment above that speaks of the origin of the label. The ‚Äúyou‚Äù here was meant generally, not personally to OP."
10lt7tb,"Oh thank gods, I thought it was just me! 

Ugh. I really just hate them. Which isn't to say I have universally horrible shopping trips, it's that the entire experience is just ugh and made worse from start to finish since Covid. Markets are almost always dirty these days, no one is around to help, offer 40 versions of things I don't buy (ketchup looking at you), and not enough stuff I do need (egg substitute), if you're lucky 1 or 2 cashiers working and you get pushed to self checkout. I don't want to be pushed to do that. If I wanna do that, I'll do it. But give me a discount for it. I do not WORK for the store! 

I used to treat myself for doing it by grabbing sushi, but most of the stores here don't have sushi. :( 

Today I treated myself to two little plants, instead."
10lt7tb,"lol, I'm 49 and my 18-y-o son used to call me Boomer allllllll the time at your son's age and it drove me crazy. Sometimes he called me BOOM CITY, or he'd pick up the phone and say WAZZAP BOOM?

i was like omg will you cut it out?! But I still laughed."
10lt7tb,I ask if my GenZ'r still wants me to pay for her college expenses. She can Fuck right off with that crap.
10lt7tb,LMAO I also call my sons ‚Äúzoomers‚Äù when they call me a boomer. lol I‚Äôm GenX.
10lt7tb,This is perfect.
10lt7tb,"Gen X is not remotely young anymore. We're middle-aged and some of us starting to act -- yep -- like the very worst of the boomers.

Also, half of the SCOTUS judges that took away a woman's right to choose in the US were Gen X. We need to face some shit about our own generation before we start slagging ""boomers"" and ""kids today."" It's so stupid."
10lt7tb,I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre getting downvoted for this. Every single point you‚Äôve made is on the money. There‚Äôs some salty Gen Xers floating around here.
10lt7tb,"So there are wonderful boomers and terrible Xers and the reverse and then some. It's just so silly to have wars based on when you were born, something no one has any control over. It's nothing to ""take credit"" for that you happened to be born in a certain year. So, so, so, so ridiculous."
10lt7tb,"That's denial. They are 100% Gen Xers.

Again -- every generation has wonderful and terrible people in it. This is why generational wars are so incredibly stupid. Generations are not a monolith. They are very large, very diverse and have very different types of people within them."
10lt7tb,"I don't understand what the problem is with saying we shouldn't engage in generational wars. What nonsense?? You have people in this thread ragging on ""boomers,"" and it's ridiculous and divisive, and all I'm saying is, it's stupid to engage in generational war when every generation is full of both wonderful and horrible people. There is no one kind of ""boomer"" or ""Xer"" or ""millennial"" or ""Gen Zer."" Every generation is extremely rich and diverse.

THIS you have a problem with? You say that's nonsense and tell me to ""shut  up?"" And you think that's cool?"
10lt7tb,Not sure assault is called for but if we‚Äôre talking about the offender being a federal employee you could threaten to report (or go ahead and report him/her) for violation of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975
10lt7tb,Battery is the touching. Assault is the threat of violence to the point you feel fear. At least in VA.
10lt7tb,"Yes, that is true but wasn't what I was trying to say. I just mean if he was worried about being embarrassed by this interaction, then he'd be REALLY embarrassed if he any of his colleagues found out he filed a police report over it."
10lt7tb,"Also she emphasizes that she did it ""hard"" and hopes he developed a bad bruise?? I actually really hope it's a BS story. Because, yes, the clapping sounds ridiculous/fake. And we don't even get the backstory of why he called her ""boomer."" 

How does that story have almost 200 likes??"
10lt7tb,It's weird how some here are treating that story as if it's heroic. I'm honestly stunned any grown woman would do that.
10lt7tb,I asked her the back story/why he called her boomer. No response. Naturally.
10lt7tb,It actually makes my skin crawl to even think about purposely touching a stranger's head.
10lt7tb,"It was nothing that big, I was having a cordial conversation with my post master, lovely woman, like I do every time I go in‚Ä¶ about the weather‚Ä¶ the village gossip‚Ä¶. We‚Äôre always friendly.  He was impatient, said something like ‚Äúthink you could hurry it up there Boomer‚Äù‚Ä¶ in all fairness my menopause has a new friend called rage and she shows up when I least expect it.  She claps back with a vengeance."

10lt7tb,"To be fair, those women (usually white Gen Xers) are ruining it for the rest of us. There are indeed some truly awful white middle-aged women out there. We can be the worst, sadly. I agree it isn't fair to paint with a broad brush and not allow any of us to complain about anything, etc. But some of our sisters are seriously fucked up."
10lt7tb,My Aunt Karen is just the sweetest. She‚Äôs got dementia. üòû
10lt7tb,Tbh if they're calling customers derogatory names they don't want that job much.
10lt7tb,Fair enough in respect to those comments.
10lt7tb,"Yes. But lots of the perpetrators are Gen X white, sadly. We're not so great."
10lt7tb,"Fair enough. But I think what irks me is the ""white privilege"" angle. Being white doesn't mean you are automatically ""butting in"" or ""saving the world."" I'm not even sure what this means, but it implies (to me anyway) that this is default behavior for white women, and hence feeds into the stereotype and its assumptions. It further implies (to me anyway) that there are no justifications for ""butting in"" if you are a white woman. You seem to have particular scenarios or contexts in mind here that I'm not getting."
10lt7tb,"My son is 21, he thought calling me boomer was funny so I started telling him ""ok zoomer"" it leveled the playing field he hates it."
10lt7tb,"Of course you laughed, those are actually pretty good! :-p"
10lt7tb,"Gen X is getting old and cranky, lol."
10lt7tb,It is silly. You‚Äôre right. This thread is just not the right thread is all.
10lt7tb,"Well, is it really denial when they‚Äôre not even human?"
10lt7tb,"She wasn't an employee. Also, we have zero idea of the back story here. The whole thing sounds very off."
10lt7tb,"It is I believe, technically, assault. You can pat somebody on the arm and from a legal standpoint, it's ""assault,"" so I've heard. I ain't no lawyer-type though. Still wouldn't want to take chances."
10lt7tb,Because some people will always justify their bad behavior rather than realize/recognize there‚Äôs a reason people called them a ‚Äúbad name.‚Äù
10lt7tb,"She‚Äôs every bit a Karen; wasting other people‚Äôs time, unaware of her surroundings, justifying assault because she felt like it, and being sexist against the dude by inferring it‚Äôs not manly to report assault because of the perpetrator. I bet she‚Äôs horrible."
10lt7tb,"Naturally!  If that even happened, since it has ""and then everyone stood up and applauded"" vibes"
10lt7tb,"OK, but to be fair -- going to the post office sucks. There is always a long line. People just want to get in, get their shit done and leave. So I can understand why the guy might have been really annoyed that you and your postmaster were shooting the shit while the line behind you grew. That isn't really cool. He needn't have pulled out the ""boomer,"" but come on -- when you're at the post office, just do your thing and leave so the line can move swiftly. Everyone is cranky when they have to go to the post office. Don't make it even worse for people! It's just not the time to have a gossip fest with your mate."
10lt7tb,"Yes, I agree. Some of the video of these women losing it are insane! It doesn‚Äôt help for the rest of us"
10lt7tb,Oh I'm so sorry. I just lost an aunt to complications of dementia. It's a horrible disease. :(
10lt7tb,That's a massive over generalization.  Every age group and race has good and bad people.
10lt7tb,Holy cow! It‚Äôs wild! Lol
10lt7tb,"It started because people above are ragging on ""boomers,"" the generation above us, which is mind-bogglingly ageist and gross. And yet we complain when millennials and Gen Z call us old and cranky?? I hate generational war shit. It's absurdly stupid."
10lt7tb,"Yes, and this is actually a really dismissive and unproductive take. They *are* human and they *are* doing real, measurable, long lasting damage. We would all do well to remember that."
10lt7tb,It is. I'm not advocating anyone else do it.
10lt7tb,"Yeah, the explanation that she was shooting the shit/gossiping with her postmaster while people were waiting in line behind her did not make her sound any better, lol. No one likes a person who is holding up the line at the post office, once of the most miserable places in the world to be (and often with some of the longest lines). Just do your business and leave! I'd be completely pissed at her, too, if I were waiting in line and she was just blabbing away about the weather."
10lt7tb,Yeah. Not quite buying anything about the story.
10lt7tb,It really is. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.
10lt7tb,"Obviously. Did I say ALL Gen X white women? I just said, unfortunately, middle-aged white women are overrepresented in this group. As we are overrepresented in the Trump voting pool. It's not worth being in denial about."
10lt7tb,"And hate to say it, but while ""Karen"" is a problematic term and can be misused, there are absolutely some very obnoxious, classist, middle-aged white women who look down at retail workers and others ""below"" them, treat them like shit and deserve the heat."
10lt7tb,"It is. And it feels like it‚Äôs gotten more prominent in the last 15 years or so. That might just be because I notice it now whereas I didn‚Äôt before. But it seems like it‚Äôs everywhere. Even when the framing isn‚Äôt adversarial or negative, I notice people referencing their generation as part of their identity. (moreso than I feel I noticed before.)"
10lt7tb,Who flicks someone in the forehead so hard they instantly leave a bruise?   Some sort of Super Karen?
10lt7tb,Thank you.
10lt7tb,Okay.  I am Canadian.  Over 25% of the population are immigrants or on temporary work visas.  Lots of different races and countries of origin.  I would say that middle aged white women here make extra efforts to be nice even in situations where it is trying.  There is a stereotype of a southern white woman Trump supporter but I have never met a Trump supporter in real life lol.
10lt7tb,"100% agree. If I had been born two and a half months later, I would be considered a millennial and I‚Äôve worked a lot of retail and customer service jobs. I‚Äôve seen this in action a LOT. I had a woman, who was talking loudly on her cell phone, *snap her fingers at me* to get me to come over to help her, then proceeded to get annoyed with me when I was trying to show her the jewelry she asked to see because she was still on the phone and I was ‚Äòinterrupting‚Äô her conversation. I just looked at her and raised my eyebrows and said, ‚ÄúLet me know when you‚Äôre finished with your conversation and I‚Äôll be happy to give you in depth help!‚Äù 

It really bugs me, too, when us Olds look down on teens for what they don‚Äôt know. So what if they don‚Äôt know what certain vegetables are?? I can cook now, but I sure as hell wasn‚Äôt interested at 17! Gaps in knowledge doesn‚Äôt mean someone is stupid, it just means they have more to learn! I feel like we have forgotten what it was like to be 17, and that we didn‚Äôt know wtf okra or leeks or parsnips were back then, either.

Edit: clarity"
10lt7tb,"Yep. I mean -- hating on those older and younger than you are is nothing new. You can find quotes of Socrates ragging on ""the kids today,"" lol. 

But identifying so strongly with NAMED generations kind of feels new-ish. The obsession with generational cohort identification seems to have at least gotten much stronger since the boomers, because they WERE identified with their birth cohort so much in the media. 

So now it's all about these different groups that are actually, in and of themselves, enormously rich and diverse. But Gen Xers will say, ""Oh, WE don't do that!"" as if all 65 million of us are a monolith. And then when you point out  high-profile Xers they don't like (say, Marjorie Taylor Greene or Ted Cruz), they'll say, ""Oh, we don't accept them as our own.""

It's SO DUMB. I just cannot."
10lt7tb,Lol. Insane.
10lt7tb,"You are quite sheltered, lol."
10lt7tb,And liberal women can quite honestly be the worst in some ways. Casual racism is huge among that set.
10hx4u5,"You‚Äôve got this!!! 

Good for you for reaching out in here. Ageism is very real. I was unemployed 2019-2021, and got a great job with a former (fabulous) boss last January. I‚Äôm 63. I came in with battered and bruised confidence too. I had just quit an absolutely terrible, toxic job that I only lasted 4 months in just before that. I‚Äôve NEVER quit a job after 4 months in my entire life. I had been in tears literally every Friday with my boss at that shit-show company. So I can totally relate to what it feels like to be beaten down. It‚Äôs horrific.

Here‚Äôs something that might help boost your confidence:

Take a few minutes to write out (hand write on paper, not type) things you enjoyed about working at that organization previously. Not like it‚Äôs going on a resume. Just messy writing that no one else will read. 

Take the time to sit quietly and immerse yourself in the memories of how good it felt to work there before. 

What was I great at?

What did I enjoy about the organization as a whole? What did I enjoy about my coworkers?

What was I told I was good at by others? 
(Often things that are our strengths come so easily to us that we discount them and think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs easy, so it doesn‚Äôt really count. IT COUNTS!)

What else was I good at?

Is there anything else?

(Keep asking that.) 

If you‚Äôre hired, what are you looking forward to contributing to the organization? To your coworkers?

Sounds like they could rely on you to bring stability after a difficult period. They may be suffering a similar lack of confidence feeling as an organization to have made such a bad hire just before you. They need to next person hired to help them regain their own confidence and help them recover. (I don‚Äôt recommend saying it in that way too them - just a perspective for you to consider.)


Then keep that list out where you‚Äôll see it, with a pen next to it, so you can keep adding to it as you continue to remember new things over the next several days. 

You‚Äôve got this!!!

10hx4u5,"Hey! Get in the wonder woman pose, in front of a mirror and look at the perfect candidate. Menopause cannot cancel all your skills (the tech ones and the soft ones), all the radiant professional intelligence you carry and all the success you can and will bring to those smart enough to hire you. Don‚Äôt let shit mess with your head and be your best friend in this.

I am sending you my premium mojo from central wester Europe, seasoned with my southern European passion. 

Smash them lady!"
10hx4u5,"Sending you hugs. And mojo. And hopefully high fives shortly.   

I just have to say - the effort to keep trying is big. Even if you don't feel it right now. Putting yourself out there is hard, especially when it feels like the world is against you.  I'm proud of you."
10hx4u5,"Good luck! üôèüèºand remember‚Ä¶ Women don‚Äôt take enough credit for the work we do. Recall some of your biggest accomplishments in your career- what did you solve? How much money did it save? Who did you help? 
I have interviewed hundreds of people over the course of my career and this is the difference- no matter what our age: women who have the same experience as men believe that they‚Äôre less qualified and don‚Äôt take nearly as much credit for doing the same work. Sending you all the good üíìjuju, can‚Äôt wait to hear how it goes ü•Ç"
10hx4u5,"I don‚Äôt know you or anything but I have a good feeling about this one. Esp since you worked there before so you already have that advantage. Sounds like you have it in the bag so try to be relaxed and remain composed. Best of luck and pls report back as to
How it went!

Oh one little Jedi mind trick I use at work during stressful meetings and video conferences is a fake smile and talking softly like a YouTube crafter. Lol. People seem really comforted when I do those things even if I‚Äôm raging inside. They literally cannot see what is going on inside me. I have sat thru some Very tense meetings with my fake
Smile and calm voice - and noticed how the mood in the room softened as a result. Maybe give it a shot"
10hx4u5,Look up Amy Cuddy power pose on YouTube. It‚Äôs completely ridiculous and it completely works! Be assertive about your skills and what you can achieve. It‚Äôs really easy to be overcome by workplace toxicity that makes you doubt yourself and sometimes you have to lift your head to be able to see that for what it is. Remember to interview them as much as they interview you. You got this!!!
10hx4u5,You‚Äôve got this!  Pull up those bootstraps and go in there with a TON of positivity and energy (I know this bit is hard some days). Sending you as much mojo as I can.  Please come back and update us when you slam dunk this!
10hx4u5,"Three or four rounds of interviews is ridiculous, there's no reason to put people through that. 

Be bold and straightforward. Tell them you love the company, had a great time, want to hear how they conceive of the role since it's likely different from when you were there, tell them straight-up whether that's you or not, and tell them that you're also not here to go through rounds and rounds of interviews: you can see within an interview or two whether or not you want to work with them and you appreciate it when companies are well-organized and respect your time and energy as well. Tell them what your salary requirements are, just be straight up about what you bring to the table. Tell them you are also there to promote diversity within organizations. They don't have to know you'll do it for real. 

And take notes. If they're using coded language, if they're asking questions that fall foul of labor rules, if they're talking about ""fit"", then sister, get your lawyer ready."
10hx4u5,"Alright - I'm an Exec Recruiter and Coach and in FULL PERI so I'm here to give you all the good mojo.  I feel your pain, I've been over-confident most of my career - meeting with a CEO, no problem - presentation with execs: easy.   I've been an overachieving workaholic for most of my career and peri has kicked my ass.  SO I RELATE.  I'm scared I'll forget something, lose my train of thought on an important call - all the things.  Whew - here's what I'll tell you.  Most people are struggling.  I coach exec teams and most of them are struggling, hormonal or not.  They're full of fear, trying to prove something and making all sorts of ridiculous mistakes and errors in judgment.   Sit in your spot - meaning - get really clear with yourself about how valuable you are - as a human, as a confidante, as an expert in your field.  Every company I've ever worked for has desperately needed more sage wisdom.  They would be lucky to have you - and the right hiring crew will see that.  Apart from that, the best way to prepare yourself is to do all the homework, prep, and to give yourself all the love, patience and kindness possible.  And if they don't end up hiring you - the right one is coming.  I'd be happy to chat with you, give you a little free expert opinion if you're interested."
10hx4u5,"Job hunting really sucks, but try to avoid seeing yourself as the problem why you‚Äôre not getting a job right now. Companies aren‚Äôt hiring like they used to, and there‚Äôs a ton of competition from layoffs."
10hx4u5,"Thanks everyone for the mojo, encouragement and advice! The interview was today... The weather was horrible, but luckily by my interview time the roads were ok. I think I did really well, but they didn't ask me as many questions as I thought they would. I already know quite a bit about the organization, structure and some of its large projects that it does. So, I do think that was an advantage, additionally I have a really good relationship with a region that they struggle with. I think they were surprised how they saw it as a problem and I saw it as an opportunity. Hopefully, that helps. So, the timeline is a month, because they will make a recommendation to the rest of the people making the decision collectively.

Wish me luck and thanks again for the tremendous support and boost of confidence. I felt that I did the best I could."
10m0be3,"I would look into endocrinologists in your area. I see one here in LA who is a holistic practitioner. She only prescribes bioidentical hormones so I use a compounding pharmacy. I use estriol cream and I disagree it‚Äôs not effective. My skin started glowing, and my period was normal this month."
10m0be3,"estriol is one of the weakest estrogens, it's the hormone that supports pregnancy, and there's not a lot of research that it's effective for menopause."
10m0be3,"You can get estriol online, OTC in USA. No doctor visit required. Good for the skin."
10m0be3,"For anyone interested, this is a transcript of a podcast that explains the benefits of Estriol cream https://progressyourhealth.com/podcast/can-you-put-estriol-cream-on-your-face/"
10m0be3,"Thanks so much. Weirdly enough I have an endocrinologist for my PCOS. But she wants be to use vaginal tablets. I want estriol cream, which is not as strong, to use both internally and on the labia AND I love the idea of applying some elsewhere for cosmetic purposes :)"
10m0be3,Thanks for sharing your experience!
10m0be3,That‚Äôs part of why I want to use it (it being weakest). I‚Äôve read a lot about it and would love to use estriol for my needs.
10m0be3,One study (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13697137.2017.1421923) but there are more. Certainly not as many as estradiol but the lower risks of side effects and the lack of systemic absorption (I want to use as a vaginal cream) are what is most attractive to me.
10m0be3,Thanks. I‚Äôve been reading about some brands for face (which I would also like) but haven‚Äôt found anything specifically for the vagina. I was hoping I could find a physician that would be willing to prescribe this: https://www.harborcompounding.com/estriol-vaginal-cream
10m0be3,like weak being...completely ineffective.
10m0be3,"Estriol was prescribed as a popular treatment for vaginal atrophy, but not so much anymore.  As for systemic use, it's not effective."

10m0be3,There are more studies showing its effectiveness and it is used in Europe under a brand name prescription (Ovestin). I‚Äôd like to try it for myself.
10m0be3,I don‚Äôt want it for systemic. I want to use something that‚Äôs not as strong as estradiol right now as a vaginal cream.
10m0be3,"I‚Äôve seen that too, thanks for sharing. I have a feeling the compounding pharmacy may be cheaper. They do have an option to call and be connected with physicians they work with but I‚Äôm based in NY and they‚Äôre out West so not sure how or if that will work. I‚Äôve researched this so much though ‚Ä¶ at this point I don‚Äôt see any other options unless I find a telehealth or local doctor who‚Äôs open to prescribing estriol that takes my insurance ‚Ä¶."
10m0be3,This doctor also sells it but only treats patients in PA https://dradrianmd.com/store/pc/estriol-vaginal-cream-bio-identical-hormone-replacement-therapy-safe-for-women
10m0be3,"Then it may work for you...also know that despite estradiol being the strongest of our estrogens, the dosage in vaginal application is actually quite low."
10m0be3,Interesting.
111cdo6,"Funsies!! 

I get an occasional zit still‚Äîalso 55. It‚Äôs also amazing because I use enough retinol to resurface my face weekly (mild exaggeration). 

I use tea tree oil on the buggers and it works brilliantly."
111cdo6,"I use Musely and love it.

The night cream is like a very light peel, so I use it 2-3 times a week. It‚Äôs convinced me to hold off a little on Botox‚Äî it‚Äôs made my smile lines practically disappear and diminished my eye & forehead wrinkles by about 50%.

At first it brought up impurities and made me break out a little bit (that went away after a week or so) due to the active ingredient‚Äî trentinoin (sp?)‚Äî but since then I‚Äôve had clearer skin."
111cdo6,Never had acne until I turned about 47. At least I understand what my teenagers are going through.
111cdo6,Yes...  My chin was looking kinda of wonky..  I cut back on estrogen creme a tad.. Not sure if it was too much or maybe stress.
10qc2hz,"YES!!! I used to be a fast, competitive runner. This summer, I found myself unable to run more than 100 yards without becoming exhausted. It was crazy!  Was it having covid? The new 30 pounds I put on.  After 2 weeks on the lowest dose hrt patch, I was able to run 5 miles nonstop like old times.  The gyn told me estrogen impacts many of our systems. It's such a crazy thing to me!"
10qc2hz,"I used to work at Rodale with the Runners' World guys -- this is pretty normal. I got all excited because I closed out January at 43 mi for the entire month.

Which things to do with aging are taking you out, it's a good question, but they come for most of us. I ran my first road race in years last fall -- a 5k, ran as a bandit -- assuming I was pathetically slow, but I came in fourth in my age group. Going back next year to pick up a medal. Really, though, I'm running 10+ min miles. 

There was a lot of study done on men in the 80s and 90s about the horror of slowdown as you age, and as it happens the smallish percent decline in times and stamina over the years after 40 or so snowball pretty fast. My guess is that orthos, cardios, etc. are all getting a steady trickle of Gen X Title-IX-loving women showing up saying wtf, doc, what's happening here. They don't know, is the answer. We're the first women to do this in large numbers, like in the world, ever.

Autoimmune disorders can do a lot of silent damage, and if you're feeling generally out of gas but thyroid is normal, I'd be inclined to do a dive into mitochondrial disorders like what you see in ME/CFS. I'd also want to poke the pulmonary doc again just in case there's a hanging-around pneumonia. I had walking pneumonia for ages and was too thick to figure it out -- I'd go to the gym and figure I just sucked at running now. Until the day I had to call an ambulance. Took a long time to get there."
10qc2hz,"Not quite the same intensity as your experience, I think, since I have never done a marathon in my life--? But I have noticed a really sharp decline in my fitness endurance. I'm always tired and I can barely do half of what I used to do. One of my favorite exercises that I've kept up over the past decade is running up and down an outdoor staircase in my neighborhood. I used to be able to run that thing like 20 reps, sometimes 30, easy. Now? I can barely do 10 and usually by 8 I'm gasping. 

I also notice that if I do something like skip a week (because of having a cold, or being really busy/tired), I am immediately thrown back to square one. Like, I feel as if I haven't exercised for a YEAR instead of a few days. 

I guess we can chalk it up to age? I'm only 51 :( In otherwise very good health."
10qc2hz,"I run. Not the same experience as you - I‚Äôm an occasional half marathon runner. I caught a terrible flu at the end of 2019 (not COVID) + a bit of ‚Äúlong flu‚Äù that followed. It took me about 6 months to get back to a decent running pattern after that, though still not as fast as previously. Then the tail end of peri menopause hit and I started getting chronic pains all over that I really found it hard to run through without stopping. Started weight training, and that helped somewhat, but not enough. Coincidentally I later (very recently) started HRT for brutal hot flashes + extreme insomnia, and it took all my aches away with it. I‚Äôve been running better now, though due to scheduling + mega winter where I live, not as much as I‚Äôd like. But it feels like night and day even using a treadmill. I think if you‚Äôve had a bad flu or even COVID, it might have longer term affects than you think, especially as you get older. I was surprised that a flu would knock me down for so long on the running front. If you‚Äôre stopping due to body aches and pains though, it might be due to low estrogen."
10qc2hz,"I've never been super fit or fast but always active in some way. Running so hard now and improvement is at snails pace! Even doing housework and stuff, I have to rest in between jobs! I hate it so much, I want my energy back!"
10qc2hz,"Used to be a half marathoner.  Then in 2016 had foot surgery.  Never gotten back the stamina.  Was up to 10 miles/run about 2 years ago but have slowed down and my distance isn't there.  I now have accepted 4 5 miles runs a week and 2 5Ks.  It is really hard to accept especially with the weight gain.  üò≠üò≠üò≠

Edit: should add that I had some lung issues when I lived in Australia in 2019 during the bushfires - struggled to breathe for obvious reasons and had lots of UTIs as part of it.  But I should be back to normal now.  I am not."
10qc2hz,"Thank you for this post. It gives me comfort knowing that other runners have shared my experience. 

I was not a marathon runner. I would however run 10km daily on the treadmill, comfortably, in about 56mins. I did this for the better part of 10years. This was combined with strength training with a personal trainer. 

Suddenly (2011) I was not only exhausted and out of breath within the first 5 mins of running, but my legs just felt heavy. Eventually I gave up running- with the heaviest of hearts- but continued to exercise. My stamina and exercise tolerance has never been the same ever. 

Last year I saw an integrative medical doctor.  My DHEA levels were at 1.5- way below the normal range. His eventual diagnosis was adrenal fatigue‚Ä¶. He asked me this question as he knew about my running years earlier. ‚ÄúDid you experience the sudden crash?‚Äù ‚Äú Were you just unable to run one day?‚Äù My lightbulb moment ‚Ä¶ 

I have read some of the other comments. 
Fully agree- 
Estrogen dominance,hormonal imbalance plays a huge role  in the sudden crash. 
CFS/ ME due to prolonged stress with the impact on cortisol and subsequently hormones must be looked into. 
Adrenal fatigue another possible cause. 

Unbeknown to me I was actually in peri-menopause in 2010. I had all the symptoms of Estrogen dominance. I was experiencing PMDD( Premenstrual dysphoric disorder). My progesterone levels were awfully low. I have no idea what my DHEA levels were at then but I‚Äôm guessing they were declining. 

The answer may just perhaps lie in understanding our hormone imbalances through testing and then getting the necessary intervention."
10qc2hz,"Sadly most medical professionals especially gynaecologists have little knowledge of the hormonal imbalances brought on by peri-menopause and menopause. It‚Äôs just considered a natural/normal part of the aging process for women- but those who Know, Know better.  (My daughter is a newly qualified medical doctor serving her internship. She is also clueless for want of a better word) 

HRT use was freely prescribed until the link to cancer. Being conservative and going without balancing our hormones has other implications. Research shows the correlation between heart disease, high cholesterol, insulin resistance etc all linked to the imbalance in Estrogen and progesterone. 

A doctor that is knowledgable regarding balancing hormones using bio-identical hormone replacement is necessary.

All the very best- do keep us updated -:)"
10qc2hz,"OMG, scary but thank you! I will keep digging."
10qc2hz,"It‚Äôs such a mystery!! I would agree with just ‚Äúgetting older‚Äù but the crazy thing is that, as a runner, I have seen women in their 60s, 70s and 80s running marathons! Slower, sure - but with the stamina to run 26.2 miles! Somehow some of us experience this and others don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ very perplexing!"
10qc2hz,"Thank you! I was healthy as a horse (other than rheumatoid arthritis) when this hit - back in 2014, well before Covid. But it did coincide with perimenopause."
10qc2hz,"Oh wow, the ‚Äúsudden crash.‚Äù I FEEL SO SEEN!! One of my closest friends is an OBGYN and a marathon runner - whom I used to race with - and when I talk to her about this, she just goes blank. It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt compute at all! But I feel like those who know, KNOW! And yes, I was in peri at 2014 and didn‚Äôt know it. Even if I had known it, I was entirely ignorant about the possible implications of it! I‚Äôm eager for my appointment with a new doctor - coming up in June."
10qc2hz,"Some people also run infinity miles, or run every day, and just don't get injured. Lucky biology....You have to keep in mind that Joanie's a mad outlier."
10ov55g,"I‚Äôm sorry about your aunt. It sounds like long life is in your family genes but that doesn‚Äôt make losing our loved ones any easier.

I do feel preoccupied by death and mortality at the moment. And for the last few months. My own and others. I‚Äôve had some little things diagnosed here and there and have had some people I know (not extremely close but people I wish well) die very young. it seems like so many people our age (I‚Äôm 41) and much younger are dying. 

I‚Äôve been catching up on my health checks that I haven‚Äôt had for the past 3 years and had skin cancer recently diagnosed and removed. Thankfully caught early, hadn‚Äôt spread. My next one is a mammogram this Friday. Breast cancer runs in the family on both sides and I‚Äôve had 3 breast lump biopsies so far. I‚Äôm assuming I will need another biopsy this Friday and I just wonder how many times I can get lucky before getting bad news.

And covid has caused so much direct loss and harm. And a lot of indirect harm. I think we will start seeing a lot of late stage cancers and other diseases because so many of us have missed regular annual checks. 

I‚Äôm mulling over it all too. How do we find a way to live every day conscious of our mortality but not so conscious that it flattens us?"
10ov55g,"Lost 2 of my closest friends last year at the ripe age of 45. That completely wiped me, but have dusted myself and treading on with life. It‚Äôs very humbling and wake up call when your friends and age mates start dying"
10ov55g,"I find myself oddly pulled toward stories of celebrities/news figures near our age who are dying. I‚Äôve never been this way, but mid-life does it, I guess.  Both my grandmothers lived into their 90s, so I guess I mentally feel like I have good odds (my mind is clearly blocking out that my own mother passed when I was 11 to a brain tumor). I honest;y don‚Äôt know how to process death. One of my former employees just died - it is still rattling around in my mind and I can‚Äôt quite figure out why.

Don‚Äôt mind my rambling. I‚Äôm just with you that death is oddly more-present these days."
10ov55g,"I've been in a similar frame of mind for the last several years as well. I notice how many young people are dying, and think about my own mortality and how many have been lost over the pandemic that we know. It stills you.
Condolences to you about your Aunt."
10ov55g,"Been there. Within reason, it's not our call. Genetics says I'll be at all their funerals. Keep making new friends."
10ov55g,"My parents are in their late 70‚Äôs; their friends are starting to pass. All the church moms, teachers, friends‚Äô dads‚Ä¶ all the adults I knew as a kid are becoming scarce. 

And, my parents moved into an ALF 2 years ago. It‚Äôs great that they now have a large group of new friends to socialize with, but it seems like there is a funeral every month. I can tell it wears my dad down. It would me."
10ov55g,"Yeah, my parents are in their early 70s. And my friends are almost entirely older than me, in their late 60s and early 70s. Even if this is all part of life I get depressed sometimes thinking about the whole aging and deterioration thing.

My best friend who's 73 had a stroke while I was on vacation in Spain. Luckily she has a good social support network of friends and neighbors as I felt really useless being so far away. When I got back I went straight from the airport after 24+ hours of flying to visit her, she was back home from there, luckily the stroke was pretty mild. But they also discovered some heart issues. She's recovering great, though, nearly back to 100% after a few months.

We still go out on the weekends but just low-key stuff: a little light shopping, going out to eat, seeing movies. She talks about wanting to go on a cruise, which seems doable but -- we went last year but she hadn't been on vacation in a few years because of COVID and I think was surprised and not aware of how her physical abilities had declined. She had a fall and ended up in the med center though was ultimately all right. She's not able to do really active things though she really wants to and believes she still can. It's frustrating for her and I feel for her and then I also know it'll be me in 20 or 30 years, probably."
10ocs81,I get that really bad. I have rheumatoid arthritis and raynaud's. You might want to look up raynaud's because those are the symptoms. I would either tell my Dr or go see a rheumatologist.  Be careful if they try to put you on gabapentin tho. It made me feel very drugged and dizzy and the withdrawals are terrible.  Some home remedies that I try are putting my hands and feet in a paraffin wax bath. Tucking my feet under the covers and onto a heating pad. Epson salt hot baths. I know how uncomfortable it can get so hopefully you find some relief.
10ocs81,"That sounds awful!!  Is one of the meds a beta blocker?  They can exacerbate Raynaud's disease which might be what is going on.  

I've had Raynaud's forever and my feet are always cold.  I also wear wool socks (in which my feet still get sweaty, wtf?) so will blow dry my feet and change socks several times a day if necessary.  If I'm feeling fancy I wear the disposable toe warmers all day.  I'm so done with winter and long for the days where I can step outside and thaw my feet anytime on the warm concrete!

I'm sorry you're feeling so crappy and it's such an awful feeling to be dismissed by doctors. I hope everything clears for a bit tomorrow so you can relax and celebrate your special day - happy early birthday!"
10ocs81,"I can‚Äôt help but wanna shout out in solidarity.  I have the same thing, affects my feet, hands, AND nose!  It gets worse during parts of my cycle but never goes away.  I can be snuggled up in bed with thermal socks and wake up from pain in my freezing feet.  It makes no sense at all.  I have to sleep with my face covered or my nose will wake me up.  I have tried everything but no luck.  I have this theory that the hormone issues are causing a sensory issue that then tells my autonomic system to shut down the capillaries because my extremities are freezing.  The blood vessel clampdown then causes the cold to actually manifest.  I am working on it now from the point of view of ‚Äúpain reprocessing therapy‚Äù to train my brain to ignore the incorrect sensory info.  Wish I had a cure to tell you about but I don‚Äôt.  Hang in there."
10ocs81,Yes! Its so weird! I've never had an issue with this before but starting a couple years ago (I'm 51) my feet started getting extra sensitive to the cold. My toes aren't purple though - that sounds concerning & maybe time for a 2nd opinion.
10ocs81,"Also, get your magnesium levels checked. I've had this as I entered peri. It would come and go. Now, it is almost constant. Doctor found that my magnesium is very low. So I take magnesium nightly and it's starting to help."
10ocs81,"So glad Raynauds has been mentioned. It is a very common symptom of quite a few auto immune diseases. Maybe get checked for inflammatory markers, HbA1C, insulin, iron, Vit B12, Vit D and liver via blood testing. These are the common signs of having metabolic issues and/or auto immune diseases. 

I hope you get answers."
10ocs81,"I‚Äôm ready for winter to be over for sure! I feel your pain. I just saw my podiatrist last week who told me my cold feet are from my  hyperhydrosis. (I‚Äôve always had issues with excessive sweating since I was a teenager, including hands and underarms.) The constant sweating and dampness, made worse at night by night sweats, were causing me to wake up with cold, white feet.  He told me to put deodorant on my them. So far, I think it‚Äôs helping. (My sister was diagnosed with Raynaud‚Äôs but my doctor wasn‚Äôt convinced that‚Äôs my problem. Plus, her fingers get REALLY white when cold.)"
10ocs81,Yeah my doctor is sending me to a circulation specialist.
10ocs81,I've been taking magnesium for years; at first I thought it helped but I'm not sure now. Maybe everything would be worse without it?
10ocs81,"Thanks!

Got blood tested (the ""big"" test)  in September, but I got shingles right after that.

I seem to still have the virus we all had around new years, so maybe it's just making everything worse?

Raynauds looks more like how my hands look, but my toes have permanent purple swollen bumps that only go away when the weather gets warm..."
10ocs81,"Ohhh, I had gotten some Carpe lotion a long time ago for my feet and it totally worked!  I just slacked on it.  I think I will scrounge around for it - thanks!"
10ocs81,Good! I hope that doctor is able to help you!
10ocs81,"Probably! Apparently, most people are deficient in magnesium. Even with a healthy, varied diet."
10ocs81,"üëç I so wish a doctor had told me this sooner. And as an added bonus, he said the deodorant can also help reduce callouses on the feet because less sweating means less friction."
10wisxq,He is otherwise a pretty good husband and I love him. My menopausal self can't deal with this crap though. I have a demanding FT job and I outsource cleaning ON PURPOSE because I just don't want to deal with it and I'd rather pay for it.
10wisxq,"Yes, I am familiar with that particular brand of martyrdom."
10wisxq,"I like to joke that if someone's house is really clean, then beware - someone must be really pissed off. üòã"
10wisxq,"I wish my husband would rage-clean the garage. He's always complaining about it being disorganized, but I'm not the one who bought a new lawnmower and didn't get rid of the old lawnmower, pal.

His thing is also baseboards and he's always so proud of himself when he does these (I have a terrible back so I can't.) Which is fine, but c'mon, I do most of the housework and upkeep day to day, Mr. ""I cleaned the baseboards for an hour this month so give me a medal."""
10wisxq,"My ex used to do that. When I did clean, he would say, oh you finally decided to clean. When he acted all nice and told me that he had rearranged everything in my kitchen cablnets I think was the point I had no love left for him. I dont know what possessed him but that's my thing, my kitchen. This was around 25 yrs of marriage. I got to the point that I told him I didnt want to be married anymore. He started ranting/barking non sensically. He went to work graveyard shift that night came in screaming the next morning to get out of his house, not the first time he said that. He went to bed and I packed up and left never to come back. I'm in a much better marriage for 10 yrs now. Better man, better house. lol"
10wisxq,"Yeah, I  just gave up. House looks it. No fucks left to give. He does cooking, some laundry, and grocery shopping.

I am mortified to have anyone clean here. I just don't look and take drugs for depression over my OCD and ADHD tendencies.

If I were in your spot, I would leave and get myself a coffee and come back when it's clean. 

I get the ""I do everything speech"", but I own the house and I pay the taxes, he hasn't paid rent in 23 years. I consider that MY contribution."
10wisxq,"""I'm sorry did you say something? I couldn't hear you over your rage swiffing. Maybe try slamming a door if you want my attention.""          
 I'm sorry he feels the need to swirl that around you."
10wisxq,Did you call a waaambulance for him OP?
10wisxq,"Can you send him to my place for a day please? I live by myself and have some chores I can‚Äôt be arsed doing. It‚Äôll give you a break from the ‚Äòtude too. Win win :D

Edit. It‚Äôs like being an Aunty rather than a Mum - I want to be able to give him back afterwards. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt want that full time ;)"
10wisxq,"I‚Äôve never had a partner who cleaned much less rage cleaned. I had one who would once every couple of months clean the toilet bowl and would be disappointed that God didn‚Äôt give him an EGOT.

Honestly the ‚Äòliving with a partner‚Äô horror stories make me weary of ever having another live in partner. The dream would be a big enough place to have a Girl Cave of my own but apparently that is a ‚ÄòI have trust issues‚Äô sign üòÇ"
10wisxq,My husband made us all drop everything and clean the house under threat of him doing it himself and tossing everything but work/school related stuff off the balcony‚Ä¶..we knew that wasn‚Äôt serious but we also knew if he got to that point it was time to tidy up.
10wisxq,Well he‚Äôs rage cleaning you should go and do a bit of retail therapy.
10wisxq,"We need more threads about housecleaning. This is amazing and I love every comment. Thank you, OP."
10wisxq,I use to feel guilty when my husband started cleaning with a ‚Äòttude ‚Äú haha but now I don‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt think it was as much of a ttude as I thought üò¨
10wisxq,"When my kids were in their teens, if we saw my husband getting out the cleaning supplies, we would all find a good reason to leave the house."
10wisxq,"Okay hear me out. I don't know if this will apply to you guys but I know it is something that happens at our house. I'm a stay-at-home mom. Personally, on those days my husband is home on a day off or has to work from home, it bugs me. So much!

And I don't mean this in an unloving way at all! I love my husband and I greatly enjoy his company! We've been married 25 years and he's the best!

But I have systems in place. There are things I do throughout the week and throughout the day and when someone else is there, it pisses me off! It doesn't make any logical sense. But I just don't want anyone in my ""workspace"" that shouldn't be there.

I also find my husband really irritating when he's home because he wanders around the house aimlessly, leaving a mess here and there as I'm trying to clean üòÑ. And he's not a messy guy!

I really think you guys need to talk it over. We love therapy!"
10wisxq,"Grab your bag, briskly walk past him patting him on the back a couple of times and say really fast ‚ÄúThanks babe, house looks great, I‚Äôm off to to the shops‚Äù‚Ä¶.and before he can put down the mop, you‚Äôre out of there. He can piss and moan to the dog, you won‚Äôt be there to listen to the banging of the vacuum on the skirting boards, the slamming down of plates while he‚Äôs unpacking the dish washer, opening and closing kitchen cupboards loudly a million times, mumbling ‚Äúfor fucks sake‚Äù under his breath every 20 seconds, and my personal favourite, deciding to change the fucking sheets when I‚Äôve just decided to lie on the bed and watch something. The sheets were done yesterday, remember? Yeah, funny that. 

And because you‚Äôre a good person, you‚Äôll come home with stuff from the shops for a nice early dinner that you can make without rushing, all due to you both helping out a little."
10wisxq,"My mother used to be like this.  If she was stressed, she‚Äôd clean.  When she came to visit, she‚Äôd start cleaning at 4 am and she was NOT quiet.  I think she felt that if she was cleaning, no one was allowed to be lazy and get some sleep.  I rebelled badly when I left home.  Dirty Dishes would sit on the floor because I ran out of bench space.  She was disgusted.  I have since found a happy balance.  I don‚Äôt enjoy cleaning, but enjoy a clean house.  My husband on the other hand, does not give a sh** what the house looks like.  Honestly, I prefer it because there‚Äôs absolutely no pressure on me.  I once had a dear friend who was insanely pedantic about the cleanliness of his house.  He was single and hired a cleaner to come in once a week (even though by my account, it was already spotless) His cleaners never lasted more than a month.  They would fire him as a client because they couldn‚Äôt handle how obsessive he was.  I was once told some great advice.  If you expect a certain level of cleanliness in your home, that‚Äôs on you to do because no one else cares.  
Perhaps husband has much higher expectations and it‚Äôs not on you to meet those requirements.  You work full time, are going through serious life changes AND have a cleaner.  Tell him to get stuffed.  Nicely of course."
10wisxq,"If my husband rage-cleaned instead of rage-YouTubing I think I'd be way happier, but then again I'd lose patience with him faster."
10wisxq,"I think next time he rage-cleans, I'm going to flash my big old meno-honkers at him and remind him that at least I am good in bed. Maybe that will distract him LMAO

Glad this thread took off. Just want to reiterate that my marriage is solid...we've been together a very long time...we've never been married to anyone else...and we love each other. We just get on each other's nerves here and there because we are human :) Living with someone for a couple decades will do that to ya occasionally."
10wisxq,Sounds like he should see his dr about hormone replacement therapy.
10wisxq,When he starts doing this. purposely thank him over and over and say. Thanks sweetie. I'm so exhausted. I'm glad you're cleaning. Even though you know he's being passive aggressive. Do it as soon as he starts on his rage..Then go around the house and thank him again as he cleans a new spot. Just pretend to be oblivious to his anger.
10wisxq,"With all due respect, I want to extend some compassion to whatever your husband is feeling too. In this sub especially, people ask for compassion around rage that gets expressed sideways and longs for a deeper understanding."
10wisxq,Get the house cleaner to come once a week‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs worth it.
10wisxq,"My husband gets like this over the kitchen sink. I swear, somewhere in there, he turns into Joan Crawford with that - "" No wire hangers!!!!""... all because the the drain catch wasn't cleaned."
10wisxq,"Oh, mine gets a sense of vast superiority when he cleans. As if he‚Äôs the ‚Äúonly one‚Äù who EVER lifts a finger. It‚Äôs hysterically funny, because he‚Äôs never really cleaned anything. He runs all the clothing (darks, lights plus towels and sheets) together, then stuffs it all into bins without folding or putting away. Unloads dishwasher and throws stuff into drawers with no sense of order (every drawer is a junk drawer!)‚Ä¶.. doesn‚Äôt mop floors, nothing. Countertops are dirty. 

Anyhoo, guess it‚Äôs more common than I thought? My husband has asbergers, so I don‚Äôt take anything he does too seriously, because his mind is messed up."
10wisxq,Passive aggressive cleaning makes my jaw clenched. My partner does this and my mother was the Queen of it. I get all jumpy and anxious if I hear cupboards slam or angry dishes being done. I hope it passes quickly for you!
10wisxq,"I'm laughing so hard right now because my husband did the same damn thing with the car over the weekend üòÇ  I did all the grocery shopping and took the car through the car wash, then asked him nicely to vacuum the inside. Then he proceeded to cut his hand while cleaning it, yelled at our kid, and then pouted the rest of the day because he couldn't nap and play video games. Whaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"
10wisxq,I wish I could make my husband rage clean.  Mine has no idea what cleaning in.  He just rages.
10wisxq,I really feel like there is something so manipulative and patriarchal about men and house cleaning. I‚Äôm hammering it into my preteen daughter ‚Äúclean houses are a tool of the patriarchy!‚Äù. Fuck that shit. No one ever says anything about a man‚Äôs messy house.
10wisxq,The petty award ü•á goes to your husband
10wisxq,Men are all assholes
10wisxq,"My ex used to do the same.

We had a 1 year old and I was pregnant and working, he was at home with the baby. He got upset that I was too tired at nights to do housework. He made me get up early so I could clean before work.

When I had the second, I stayed home and would wait for him to get home so I could clean with no babies in my arms. He told me it was too depressing to come home to a messy home and I needed to be better organised.  He was working 24 hour shifts, including 8 hours sleeping time, from 3pm to 3pm. 

He would rage clean once a month, but was absolutely shit at cleaning the rest of the time and blamed it all on me."
10wisxq,"This post concerns me for you, OP, because rage-cleaning in the way you described, especially on your day off, is shouting ""RESENTMENT FEST"" to me. 

I don't suggest this lightly but y'all need counseling if you want your marriage to survive. It's another thing if you don't, but resentment is extremely difficult to overcome without putting in the hard work to understand each other and compromise. It will get worse and worse and that's no way to live.

My fianc√© is EXTREMELY tidy and minimalist. I am, um, very not either. But we both have been through enough in life (both divorced) that we compromise, we move toward each other instead of further away. We both understand that neither of us is the way we are to purposely irritate the other. For a lot of reasons outside this discussion, we have a foundation of mutual respect that I didn't have with my ex-husband. That makes it easier to do the smallish things that make him less aggravated."
10wisxq,"Ummm‚Ä¶do we have the same husband? I have a rage cleaner as well.it‚Äôs really weird. I don‚Äôt always understand why he‚Äôs obsessed with a certain thing to clean when other areas may need more attention. Also, it‚Äôs all over the place so it messes up my groove."
10wisxq,"My ex used to do that, it kept the house very clean"
10wisxq,I rage clean üò≠ but thankfully very very infrequently
10wisxq,"As the rage cleaner in the house, I apologize for him. 

I‚Äôm not a particularly tidy person but in the past couple of years I finally got in the routine of a Saturday clean. But I was doing it by myself and I‚Äôd get super stressed over it. My mom was/is a clean freak and I have a lot of anxiety and shame around slobbiness. Then my youngest moved back home we had a great setup where everyone had a set of chores and it took like an hour. I never got mad. Then youngest got a job that included weekend shifts and gradually I was doing the whole house by myself again and I can feel the anxiety returning. I‚Äôve skipped it for two straight weekends and it‚Äôs going to be an issue. Hiring help is not an option."
10wisxq,I‚Äôd be really sweet about thanking him and I‚Äôd give him one of those children‚Äôs gold medals too. Let him get on with it. He will only get a kick out of it if you get irritated.
10wisxq,It's time to take yourself out for a nice day-long outing.
10wisxq,"I would not be able to live in a ‚Äúpit‚Äù. Having a clean and organized house is blissful to me. The biweekly clean feels like a spa visit for me and is important for my mental health. It may not be your jam but if your spouse is getting so upset they are rage cleaning it is probably not just their mess they are cleaning up and there is some underlying resentment to flip it from maintenance cleaning to rage cleaning. If I feel I have to take a whole day off to get the house in order, the house must have  went too sideways. 

If you had actual plans or took the time off together I get being pissed that the day off turned into cleaning but if you know your spouse gets really upset about untidy house, maybe there is some more cleaning you can do to keep them sane. We all get a little crazy and it‚Äôs loved ones who can keep us from going over the edge."
10wisxq,My husband and I kind of do this to each other. Smoking a joint will chill me out enough to deal‚Ä¶ whichever side of the equation I‚Äôm on that day.
10wisxq,He sounds fun. /s
10wisxq,"My hubby grew up in a household where the boys didn't have to clean anything! That changed quickly after we married! I had to teach him how to vacuum, clean a bathroom, dust, etc. 

A couple years after we married, I walked into the bathroom while he was cleaning it. He was using THE TOILET BRUSH TO CLEAN THE TOILET, SINK, TUB, AND COUNTER!!! After I freaked and washed everything down with 10 bottles of bleach, he explained that the toilet brush ""cleaned so well and felt he was being efficient"". LOL!! After 30 years of marriage, we still howl over that!!"
10wisxq,My husband also does this üôÑ
10wisxq,Sit with your feet up with a box of chocolates and ignore him lol or occasionally look at him at laugh üòÇ
10wisxq,I would say ‚Äúyou go buddy! ‚Äú
10wisxq,"I hate to take his side as much as I‚Äôm
Not a fan of men in general- but why is the bed still unmade at 5pm? I‚Äôm a rage cleaner too. He likes things a certain way- and I get that.

The house needs to be picked up daily with deeper cleans once a week. 2x a month house keeper is not frequent enough

Maybe check out the GoCleanGo Instagram page and get inspired. I got the cleaning army calendar for
Myself
For Xmas and am really
Enjoying it

Maybe look at this as something you can do together"
10wisxq,Maybe a conversation should be had with husband about why he feels the way he does instead of mocking him on Reddit. If my house only got cleaned twice a month I‚Äôd be rage-y too.
10wisxq,Oh hell yeah maid service is the best self-care I have going.
10wisxq,"I outsource the laundry because a disabling condition forced me to choose my battles, but my husband refuses to let me send his clothes out and insists he can do it himself. 

A couple of weekends ago, when I was off my heart meds prior to a bunch of testing, he was bemoaning the fact that he had three hampers‚Äô worth of clean laundry and asked if I could just fold it for him. 

I‚Äôm usually singing his praises for the way he has taken on the things I can‚Äôt do, but you can probably guess the response he got to this request‚Ä¶"
10wisxq,"I keep my house clean. My husband came from a father who was so strict about cleaning if anything at all was under their bed they got hit with a belt. One day he made a smart remark about our pantry not being in order. I looked at him and said, ‚Äúwell, when I die please tell everyone at my funeral that I loved my grandkids and loved traveling with you all over the USA when we retired, but I kept our pantry disorganized‚Äù. He never said another word"
10wisxq,"Omg SAME. I pay a maid service to come every week. My job is so incredibly demanding. I‚Äôm on the damn phone all day long. I‚Äôm mentoring young ppl. I‚Äôm having huge meetings with senior leadership. I work in cybersecurity so occasionally I have security incidents. I‚Äôm so drained. 

And my stupid husband often turns into his MOTHER and nags about the dumbest shit. How the dishwasher is packed. Why is there a jelly knife on the counter. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt clean this it won‚Äôt be done correctly‚Äù. It drives me crazy. He passive aggressively makes dinner if I hsvev meetings that run 15 minutes passed 5 pm. He acts like if we dont have dinner on the table at 5, everyone is starving and CPS will arrest us for child neglect. Dinner time is the worst time of the day bc he‚Äôs in a foul mood about putting dinner on the table. 

I‚Äôm about to get a divorce I would rather live alone and not have to worry about leaving my stuff out or what time we eat."
10wisxq,"And that's my side gig...I clean other people's houses. I wish I had a ""me"" that would clean our house.

Wondering now how I can get my hubby to rage clean..."
10wisxq,"Next time this happens, leave the house immediately and go get a 90 minute massage. Then meet a friend for drinks."
10wisxq,Sounds like you two need to communicate or this is going to get blown out of proportion.
10wisxq,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10wisxq,Guilty! I do my best cleaning as my blood boils with anger.
10wisxq,that's funny not funny
10wisxq,I think this may be me....
10wisxq,"Right!?  The one sPeShUl PrOjEcT does not even come close to making up for days upon days of dishes, laundry, pet care, etc."
10wisxq,"My husband has this 40‚Äô shipping container that is his tool shed. He has a LOT of tools and building supplies. And the thing is utter chaos. He complains all the time about what a mess it is and spends 0 minutes ever cleaning it up and putting stuff away. One day recently I had to go in there to get something and as I walked in I made a comment, to myself, but out loud, about what a mess it was and how it needed to be cleaned. Then when I walked out realized husband had been working in his work trailer right next to the shipping container. Heh. Whoops. He didn‚Äôt let on if he‚Äôd heard my remarks but I do stand by what I said!"
10wisxq,"Mine does this with cobwebs. I'm short, I have bad vision, so I honestly just don't see them sometimes. He's tall, his vision is better than mine. He'll go through the house about every 2 months or so and proclaim that the house is full of webs and someone should do something about it. lol, I get the ones I can reach or see, but some of them, whatever.

He'll make a big deal of using my vacuum to go around the whole house getting the cobwebs down. It's kind of adorable."
10wisxq,I love it lol
10wisxq,"The first time I had someone clean after months of depression, I must have apologized to her 20 times. 

I posted anon in a moms group and asked about what they did before their cleaner came. Most said they cleaned. A few didn‚Äôt. And some of the cleaners chimed in with how they don‚Äôt expect anything. No house is too dirty and they don‚Äôt judge. 

I was still embarrassed the first few times she came over but I mostly got over it. It‚Äôs easier to do a little spot cleaning in between her visits. 

All that to say, ask around on Nextdoor for someone who doesn‚Äôt mind a big job and would come every other week but not judge. It will relive so much stress and anxiety for you!"
10wisxq,Rage swiffing. I love this.
10wisxq,Oh you might like him actually. He's cute! Even when he rage-cleans I admit he's quite handsome ;)
10wisxq,My husband is amazing and would never do this. I feel so bad for everyone in these comments who have a shitty husband.
10wisxq,"When I was a SAHM mom ^((I work full time at a hella demanding job now and DGAF about cleaning, cooking, or anything else, yay menopause)) my husband would work from home every now and then, which was  not common in those days.

I used to tell him, variously, that he was damaging my calm or fucking up my chi.

Both of those lines stolen from movies (*Firefly* and *Swordfish*), no apologies.

He'd roll out of bed late, so I couldn't pick up the bedroom or clean the en-suite bathroom or vacuum or have loud music on while I did the dishes.  

Or he'd be puttering around the living room and trying to have a conversation with me while I was vacuuming - and then get huffy when I'd turn the vacuum off for the fourth time and say, with some exasperation, ""WHAT?!?""  because then I had an ""attitude"" but dude I just WANT TO FINISH VACUUMING AND I CAN'T DO THAT IF YOU'RE INTERRUPTING ME TO ""OH BY THE WAY"" ME EVERY TWO MINUTES.  

Or he'd be stealing bits of pie filling from a pie I was baking and I'd be tripping over him every time I turned around in my smallish kitchen and it was like...can you just...I don't know...fuck off somewhere that isn't RIGHT here, in my FACE, right NOW because you're screwing up my entire system of housecleaning and cooking that I deploy while you're blissfully unaware at work?"
10wisxq,"LOL at the ""for fuck's sake"" --that's totally him"
10wisxq,This is hilarious!! I fully support flashing him. Ha!! He very well may forget what he was doing and want some loving. I understand your frustration at times and need to vent a little. It‚Äôs nothing serious for goodness sake. So next time flash him or moon him! Haha!
10wisxq,"\[long\]

I started doing this a while back.

The husband would be doing some clearly passive-aggressive angry thing and that was my cue to perform the ""What is wrong, how can I fix it, what did I do, are you mad at me"" dance, which then gave him permission to flail all over the place and act like an asshole...and then he was now in the position of being the \[somehow\] wronged one and I was apologizing even though I hadn't done anything wrong in the first place other than, say, sitting on the bed when he decided at that exact moment that he didn't like the fact that the laundry wasn't put away for two days?

Now?  Now I take **everything** at face value.  You cleaned the cat boxes with a biiiiig sigh?  Niiiice, the kitties have clean cat boxes.  You're banging around dishes and jamming them in the dishwasher?  Niiice, you're doing dishes, the sink was getting full.  You're annoyedly slinging your clothes into the dresser?  Niiiiice, you're putting away your socks.  

I take **every** comment and behavior at face value and I've **stopped** seeking the hidden meaning or playing Push You, Pull Me.  Oh, you got a problem?  **Open your damn mouth and spit it out**, otherwise I'm just going to blissfully trip along the path of my life thinking there are no issues whatsoever.  

I let him know that I'm not a psychiatrist and it's not my job to tease out what ever big feelings he's having difficulty expressing.  It's not on me to make it easier for him to regulate his emotions.  It's not on me to be a big emotional tampon to soak up all the bad stuff floating in his head so he can purge and feel better.  He doesn't get to take shit out on me that has nothing to do with me (like stress at work).  Vent?  Certainly.  Use me as a verbal punching bag because some asshole at work is doubling down on not doing a task you set for him?  Nope.

He's a grown-ass fuckin man and he should able to do all of that by now, and by forcing the issue, he's learning to do **just that**.  He asks for what he wants, he expresses when something upsets him or bothers him or he wants to talk about something.  I got very tired of chasing him down all the time just so he could give himself permission to blow up at me because we'd never learned as a couple to have a reasoned discussion that didn't turn into a (verbal) brawl.

But we're learning now, oh yes.  Yes indeedy."
10wisxq,He's a good guy (mostly) LOL. Thank you for thinking of his feelings too. I should probably not complain about a little rage cleaning here and there.
10wisxq,"I'm with you on this. I remember in the earliest days of new motherhood, I was reading online forums about how to get sleep (because of course, newborns don't let you sleep). I read SO MANY comments by women saying ""I can't nap when the baby naps, because I have to clean the house while he/she is sleeping."" I was struck by this. Women going sleep-deprived and crazy because they can't tell their spouse to do the damn cleaning...or just live in an untidy house for a bit until the baby gets more on a schedule."
10wisxq,It's probably not true...but I still laughed
10wisxq,I'm so glad to hear that he's the ex!!
10wisxq,"LOL thank you for the concern. We've been together 23 years and married for 20. Not going anywhere nor is he, I'm just bitching a bit about one of his less redeeming qualities."
10wisxq,"A bag of those gold-wrapped chocolate pirate coins, OP, so you can throw one at him every time he successfully completes a task!  Bonus points if you yell INCOMING with every coin.

<cleans cat box, gold coin bounces off the cover>

<empties dishwasher, gold coin comes sailing over the counter>

<picks up shoes, puts them on a shoe rack, gold coin lands neatly in left shoe>

<re-hangs towel on the floor in the bathroom, gold coin goes spinning into the bathtub>"
10wisxq,"He didn't clean all day long, haha, not even close. He was just banging around with an attitude straightening up. 

The irritating part of it is not so much the cleaning part, it's that when HE decides it's time to clean, it's time to clean. He doesn't leap into action when I do things around the house. 

Like, we have trash pickup very early on Monday mornings and he forgets all the time to take the cans out. I can assure you, every Monday, he is snoring in bed at 5 am when I spring up to make sure the garbage cans are pulled out for the trash man. I could be a real dick about this and bang the cans loud to wake him up, but no. I just pull them out.

And when our daughter needs JUST ABOUT ANYTHING--guess who she calls for? Yeah, she isn't asking Dad to help her with Algebra. Again, I could be a prick and say to him, passive aggressively, ""You know, it's important to my mental health that we have a child who gets good grades,"" but I don't."
10wisxq,The bed is still unmade at 5pm because I have zero fucks to give about whether my bed is made or not.
10wisxq,"Eh, he has selective rage. It's not like he does this every day. Just something he pulls out of his arsenal when he feels like it."
10wisxq,Yaaas!! I agree 100000%!
10wisxq,If you can actually find someone who will do it properly. I‚Äôve tried so many different cleaning services and they all suck! Paying them hundreds of dollars to lightly dust and vacuum seems to be the state of things these days.
10wisxq,"This sort of dinner time bullshit being the regular thing in our house when I was a kid, I have an eating disorder. So seriously : don‚Äôt put up with this shit."
10wisxq,"When you find out, let me know please."
10wisxq,Same. I‚Äôve made a New Year‚Äôs resolution to actually clean my own house more.  I mopped the floor last weekend!! Amazing.
10wisxq,Agree! Just leave and ignore the drama
10wisxq,"He's been doing this since I met him 23 years ago, LOL. He just hit my last nerve yesterday when he decided to whip the attitude out on my lazy day off."
10wisxq,"I came here to say the same LOL,  when I do a deep clean my husband finds a reason to go out and leave the house"
10wisxq,"I always do say ""good job!"" though.

Because I don't want to clean the baseboards.

To be fair, he does do over half the cooking, but he loves doing it."
10wisxq,"My husband wants another dog, as ours are becoming elders (Remy, age 12, male, miniature schnauzer; and Bella, age 10, female, miniature schnauzer and bichone frise mix). I told him flat out no, because the one who wants dogs the most does the least dog care of all 4 of us. If you want a dog, I WILL NOT be taking care of it, and when you stop caring for it, it is going to be rehomed."
10wisxq,"My husband complains that he will never have ""his"" shop because the garage is a mess. 90% of the garage is his crap because he has hoarding tendencies & refuses to get rid of ""good junk"". I refuse to let his junk spread to the house."
10wisxq,"Yeah, I'm actually having some people take items like a broken patio bench to the dump next week and I'm going to tackle the garage because I'm so tired of it. 

My husband bought one of those taller Craftsman tool chests on wheels and it took him over a year to actually put his tools in there. I had to nag, which I hate doing, but when I want to find some pliers, I don't want to look through five flower pots. Weird.

It needs new shelving in there, too."
10wisxq,"Ah yes, this too, but I get complaining about missing brush attachments. Sorry, man! Here's a microfiber dust mop. :D"
10wisxq,Thanks so much!!!
10wisxq,OP here and I feel bad now--my husband isn't shitty! And I do love him. I just hate when he decides to rage clean. LOLLLLL
10wisxq,"I'm laughing so hard I'm crying!!!!! Thank you thank you thank you! You are an excellent mind reader. It's like you're at my house a couple weeks ago. But seriously, that was fucking hilarious!"
10wisxq,"I'm laughing so hard I'm crying!!!!! Thank you thank you thank you! You are an excellent mind reader. It's like you're at my house a couple weeks ago. But seriously, that was fucking hilarious!"
10wisxq,that‚Äôs ALL OF THEM! üòÇ
10wisxq,"20 years free!

He left me when they were 6 months and 2 years old. I had chronic post natal depression, was suicidal and close to being hospitalised. He left me to get on with it with the kids and fought me when I tried to get maintenance. 

What a gem"
10wisxq,"Ugh good grief. not cool if he didn‚Äôt even clean.

We take trash out the night before because we can‚Äôt get up at 530! Seems like most of that as well. Our city is sweet and sends us a text reminder and you can ask for that morning of or Night before."
10wisxq,Ok well I understand that too and was that way most of my life until the past few years when I realized I‚Äôm Much happier and at peace in a somewhat clean environment.
10wisxq,"We actually solved the bed thing!

I had a German friend who, every morning, would make up the bed as normal, but then flip back the top sheet/blanket/comforter roughly 2/3 of the way.  I teased her about it once, her ""lazy housekeeping"" (we were good friends, she didn't take offense) and she told me that the American habit of completely making the bed as soon as you get up was **disgusting**.

Why though?  I was baffled.

She then pointed out that you spend *all night* in bed, sweating, farting, breathing, skin cells rubbing off, drooling, skin oils getting on the fabric...  

\[cue grossed-out but slowly dawning realization look on my face\]

Growing up in Germany, her mom had taught her to fold the bedclothes back to air out and - more importantly - dry out the bedclothes and expose them to sunlight for bug-killing UV rays. 

She called it ""sanitizing with sun and air"".

I went home and informed my husband what I was going to be doing with the bedclothes from now on and he agreed that it sounded logical to him, too.  (To be clear, I didn't need his buy-in, I just told him up front so I didn't have to explain the next day).

So now we've been ""making"" the bed for roughly 25 years by folding it up neat and flat like a fully-made bed, then flipping everything back roughly 2/3 of the way.  It still looks neat and made, but the sheets are exposed to air and damned if they don't stay fresh longer!"
10wisxq,"Yep- when you know, you know."
10wisxq,"Not only is our house 100% cleaner, I now have the bandwidth to purge, organize, fold, put away!"
10wisxq,"You might try to find an individual person who does cleaning. It‚Äôs one of my jobs, and I‚Äôm very conscientious and thorough; if I don‚Äôt do a good job, people aren‚Äôt going to pay me to come back

If you‚Äôre in the US, there‚Äôs an ap called Care (or care.com on a browser) that you could use."
10wisxq,"Ugh I know. My parents would fight at dinnertime and nit-pick about our manners. It made dinners unpleasant. We'd have to be home for dinner every night so we could have dinner as a family. I am not against that in general, but it was so unpleasant I would just dread it."
10wisxq,"You're not alone, my husband does this as well. At first I would always get up and start cleaning with him. After some years of that, I was like ya know what? No. He doesn't get up and start cleaning or doing anything when I'm the one emptying loading the dishwasher, vacuuming the stairs or switching laundry around, why am I feeling guilty about him actually doing something. So I stopped joining him when he gets like that and just try to enjoy the fact he's cleaning something, even with the grumpy attitude."
10wisxq,"Ha!  Same, same.  I will always clean up the kitchen after he cooks! I loathe cooking anything beyond pasta or scrambled eggs."
10wisxq,"You go, girl!!  Stand firm!!  The older dogs are going to obviously need more care when they get a bit older and throwing another dog into the mix sounds insane.  

My brother in law recently got a dog and my sister was like ""it's all on you, bud.""  She said it's such a strange feeling to not be the primary caretaker of someone/something in the house and how freeing it is.  Like if she wants to play with the dog she does.  When she's done she stops.  If the dog needs something while she's out she will gladly help but somebody else is ultimately responsible/in charge.  It's fascinating how he can take better care of this dog than he did of his two kids when they were small."
10wisxq,My husband likes to hoard the good junk. His little building out in the yard is packed full of just STUFF. I have to fight to get to the loppers and trimmers. The little attic thing out there is his Guild Bank. He keeps the good stuff up there. It's hilarious.
10wisxq,"I don't want you to feel bad at all. Your husband is displaying abusive/manipulative behavior. I know this because I was this person. Medication has greatly helped me. 

Never feel bad about what isn't your fault. You've done nothing wrong."
10wisxq,"I was just talking with a friend the other day and we deduced I never once washed my sheets my entire freshman year of college

Just thought I'd throw that out there...LOL"
10wisxq,This is what I hope for. I should call them and set up a date.
10wisxq,Thank you!
10wisxq,"I am shoveling in scrambled eggs right now, ironically, haha! ...I should have put ham in these."
10wisxq,"We had been having marriage trouble about 5 years ago, and I actually made plans to leave if he did adopt a dog. He went to a shelter and was spending time with a lovely dog there, but he actually came to his senses because I think he kinda sensed how done I was. Thankfully, things have improved."
10wisxq,"Does he also like to say "" I know it's junk, but it is good junk & I will use it to do xyz""? üòÅ Anytime he goes out of town I throw all kinds of stuff away- not once has he asked for or needed to use the specific junk."
10wisxq,"Good thing! Before he should even be considering adopting a new dog, he should take over the care of the ones you already DO have"
10wisxq,"My husband‚Äôs good junk is called ‚Äúprojects‚Äù around here. It‚Äôs not clutter, it‚Äôs pieces of this thing or that thing that need to be put together to be useful again. He despises his mom‚Äôs hoarding tendencies but he has the exact same problem."
10wisxq,Ah yes...the projects! We have a million of them.
10ocs81,I get that really bad. I have rheumatoid arthritis and raynaud's. You might want to look up raynaud's because those are the symptoms. I would either tell my Dr or go see a rheumatologist.  Be careful if they try to put you on gabapentin tho. It made me feel very drugged and dizzy and the withdrawals are terrible.  Some home remedies that I try are putting my hands and feet in a paraffin wax bath. Tucking my feet under the covers and onto a heating pad. Epson salt hot baths. I know how uncomfortable it can get so hopefully you find some relief.
10ocs81,"That sounds awful!!  Is one of the meds a beta blocker?  They can exacerbate Raynaud's disease which might be what is going on.  

I've had Raynaud's forever and my feet are always cold.  I also wear wool socks (in which my feet still get sweaty, wtf?) so will blow dry my feet and change socks several times a day if necessary.  If I'm feeling fancy I wear the disposable toe warmers all day.  I'm so done with winter and long for the days where I can step outside and thaw my feet anytime on the warm concrete!

I'm sorry you're feeling so crappy and it's such an awful feeling to be dismissed by doctors. I hope everything clears for a bit tomorrow so you can relax and celebrate your special day - happy early birthday!"
10ocs81,"I can‚Äôt help but wanna shout out in solidarity.  I have the same thing, affects my feet, hands, AND nose!  It gets worse during parts of my cycle but never goes away.  I can be snuggled up in bed with thermal socks and wake up from pain in my freezing feet.  It makes no sense at all.  I have to sleep with my face covered or my nose will wake me up.  I have tried everything but no luck.  I have this theory that the hormone issues are causing a sensory issue that then tells my autonomic system to shut down the capillaries because my extremities are freezing.  The blood vessel clampdown then causes the cold to actually manifest.  I am working on it now from the point of view of ‚Äúpain reprocessing therapy‚Äù to train my brain to ignore the incorrect sensory info.  Wish I had a cure to tell you about but I don‚Äôt.  Hang in there."
10ocs81,Yes! Its so weird! I've never had an issue with this before but starting a couple years ago (I'm 51) my feet started getting extra sensitive to the cold. My toes aren't purple though - that sounds concerning & maybe time for a 2nd opinion.
10ocs81,"Also, get your magnesium levels checked. I've had this as I entered peri. It would come and go. Now, it is almost constant. Doctor found that my magnesium is very low. So I take magnesium nightly and it's starting to help."
10ocs81,"So glad Raynauds has been mentioned. It is a very common symptom of quite a few auto immune diseases. Maybe get checked for inflammatory markers, HbA1C, insulin, iron, Vit B12, Vit D and liver via blood testing. These are the common signs of having metabolic issues and/or auto immune diseases. 

I hope you get answers."
10ocs81,"I‚Äôm ready for winter to be over for sure! I feel your pain. I just saw my podiatrist last week who told me my cold feet are from my  hyperhydrosis. (I‚Äôve always had issues with excessive sweating since I was a teenager, including hands and underarms.) The constant sweating and dampness, made worse at night by night sweats, were causing me to wake up with cold, white feet.  He told me to put deodorant on my them. So far, I think it‚Äôs helping. (My sister was diagnosed with Raynaud‚Äôs but my doctor wasn‚Äôt convinced that‚Äôs my problem. Plus, her fingers get REALLY white when cold.)"
10ocs81,Yeah my doctor is sending me to a circulation specialist.
10ocs81,I've been taking magnesium for years; at first I thought it helped but I'm not sure now. Maybe everything would be worse without it?
10ocs81,"Thanks!

Got blood tested (the ""big"" test)  in September, but I got shingles right after that.

I seem to still have the virus we all had around new years, so maybe it's just making everything worse?

Raynauds looks more like how my hands look, but my toes have permanent purple swollen bumps that only go away when the weather gets warm..."
10ocs81,"Ohhh, I had gotten some Carpe lotion a long time ago for my feet and it totally worked!  I just slacked on it.  I think I will scrounge around for it - thanks!"
10ocs81,Good! I hope that doctor is able to help you!
10ocs81,"Probably! Apparently, most people are deficient in magnesium. Even with a healthy, varied diet."
10ocs81,"üëç I so wish a doctor had told me this sooner. And as an added bonus, he said the deodorant can also help reduce callouses on the feet because less sweating means less friction."
10n36nv,"I'm about 6 years further down a similar path so I just wanted to give you a wave and say you did the right thing. It's bloody hard starting again at life with 2 kids. But even now nearly 9 years of being a single parent I still often wake up and my first thought is ""thank fuck, I did it."""
10n36nv,How do you know its time to leave? I'm in my second marriage of 16 years. I feel miserable every single day. Financial part of life alone is so scary....and he doesn't want to leave. My kids are all grown up but I'm still so scared one day I wake up with regrets. How did you know it's a right decision?
10n36nv,"Damn! That's crazy that you stuck it out for so long!

I was divorced in my early 20's, but it only lasted 4 years. We were really young and super stupid. No kids, either.

I think in the long run you will be okay though. You seem to know what you want and that's important."
10n36nv,"Thank you, yes no regrets just fatigue! I will never be sorry I left him. Glad to hear it gets better!"
10n36nv,"He was a narcissist and an alcoholic. I tried for so long to help him and fix it, day by day it destroyed me and my love for him. He didn‚Äôt want to change and he wasn‚Äôt fighting for me or us. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life unhappy and begging for the love I gave and deserved in return. 
He punished me and the kids by keeping all of our money hidden in another country and made me sell our home and took half-moved away and never saw us again.
If that doesn‚Äôt show that I made the right decision I don‚Äôt know what does.
I hope you find the clarity you‚Äôre looking for, I‚Äôd say make sure you have a good support system and a place to live while you heal if you decide to leave. Sending support your way!"
10n36nv,"Worst thing I could have done- loved him and tried to save him.Took my vows seriously. Realized I should have never been afraid, the worst happened anyway and I should have taken care of myself as my partner didn‚Äôt. Live and learn."
10n36nv,Thank you for sharing. Wishing you the best.
10w1svk,It‚Äôs okay to be afraid to see a doctor/specialist.
10w1svk,"You‚Äôre not a coward. I was intimidated too when my doctor started talking about all the options.

Do you have a friend that could go with you next time? Maybe that would alleviate some of the nervous feelings from the situation‚Ä¶?"
10w1svk,"I cancelled a menopause doctor in early January.  They were expensive and I had too much anxiety to deal with it (the cost probably just added to the anxiety).  I have a different meno doctor scheduled end of this month.  I should say that I'm already on HRT, I just have unresolved physical issues.  I  never really feel fully good.  But I survive I guess."
10w1svk,"It took a year for me to finally show up for the appointment. Then, after having the medicine in a drawer for nine months, I finally started taking it last week. It‚Äôs the little patch and the progesterone pill at night. The third night, I slept the entire night without waking up drenched in sweat and thrashing to get the covers off. The sixth morning, my honey commented on how well I slept, and I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt snore at all.‚Äùü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm still petrified that I am going to gain even more weight, but pleasantly surprised that it seems to be working so quickly. I still sleep with two fans and my heater at 70, but today I am feeling hopefully optimistic. Sending you positive energy as you navigate this mess. üí™üèª"
10w1svk,"I‚Äôm the same, I‚Äôve been putting it off. I am anticipating it will be a judgemental fight. 

My rationale is, I am actually managing the symptoms ok for now, but the stress of going in will wreck all of that. I‚Äôm enjoying a little less anxiety because of it. If (when) the symptoms change and I can‚Äôt handle it, then I might as well throw the doctor on the pile, but not until then. 

Canceling social plans *is* like heroin (I assume). I‚Äôm a big fan of staying in!"
10w1svk,"I get this feeling too. I try to remind myself the doctor is there to make recommendations, but the final decision on medication is up to me."
10w1svk,Thanks ‚ô•Ô∏è  I don't have anyone so I'm just going to have to do more thinking about whether the doctor visit is worth the anxiety for me.
10q75pr,"You can use a telehealth option! I recently used [Alpha](https://helloalpha.com/) and opted to use their ""Pay per visit"" which is a one-time fee of $35. It was a chat service where I was assigned an RN and spoke to her over the course of a day or two back and forth. It took that long because when she gave me options I needed to do some research to make my decision, but all-in-all it wasn't that long. I had the option to have an Rx mailed to me, or have it filled locally, so I went the local route. Basically in under 72 hours I was on a new Rx that was covered by my insurance and only paid the $35 for the telehealth appointment. 

As far options other than HRT, there are a number of threads here about using low dose birth control pill (which is what I am doing). You may want to search for that or ""BCP"" so you can read through those as there is a lot of good content here already, and those posts helped me make my decision as well."
10q75pr," Dr Louise Newson addresses migraines and menopause in one of her podcasts:

https://www.balance-menopause.com/menopause-library/008-migraines-menopause-gp-menopause-expert-dr-sarah-ball-dr-louise-newson/

And here is her fact sheet about it:

Also There is a supplement like this you could try:

https://www.amazon.com/MigreLief-Nutritional-Suffering-Menstrual-Migraine/dp/B0074ZV652"
10q75pr,I have found my migraines are better on HRT.
10q75pr,"Maybe one of the online options like Evernow or Gennev? (I haven't used either of them myself, but they get mentioned in this sub from time to time.)"
10q75pr,"I suffered from horrible migraines until I finally got into post menopause.  So, I hope that you too have something to look forward to at least.  

I had to take a horrible medication called Imitrex. At first I used the shots and then they made it in pill form.  BCP made me feel even worse, so that‚Äôs what I did. I got a massage once a month, went to the chiropractor and took imitrex.  I am a so sorry you are suffering. 

I wish I could help you. All I want to say is keep trying to figure out something that will give you relief. Don‚Äôt give up."
10q75pr,"Hi,

 Fellow migraine sufferer here with many of the same complaints as you.  My understanding is that if you have migraines with aura HRT is likely not for you. I do not experience migraines with aura and my neurologist is fine with me trying a HRT. As is my gynecologist. My neurologist told me it's either going to help or it's not as I have been getting more chronic migraines the deeper I get into Peri and closer to menopause. Unfortunately, it does sound like you need a different provider who is more open about trying HRT. Good luck and hugs!"
10q75pr,I used Winona..I by-passed my doctor all together... Took a quiz on the Winona website and it took not even 5 mins they set me up with a plan got the stuff sent within 5 days started taking it and I feel way better!
10q75pr,"Call an independent pharmacy. If they have a functional medicine person, utilize their network to get a real  HRT person.  If you are gonna pay cash, make it worth the while.  So many posers.  You need an MD who will adjust beyond normal lab values determined by a sick normal population"
10q75pr,I've thought about the online route but I'm a little bit nervous about ordering something like that online.  My doctor says that I'm higher risk because of my migraines and I guess I really want to be sure of having the proper dosage and type of hormone.  I guess I need to do some more research!
10q75pr,Thank you!
10q75pr,"Same. 

I have a migraine disorder (I take Topiramate and Imitrex) and I was still prescribed HRT, so I find this kinda odd, honestly."
10q75pr,"Ugh, I was on Imitrex for migraines when I was in college.  I mainly got exertion migraines, usually 4 hours after a workout.  That stuff was the worst!  It ripped up my stomach every single time.  I had to stop taking it."
10q75pr,"Transdermal patches don't have the stroke risk that oral estrogen does. I get migraine with aura and am on estrogen patches. They've actually improved my migraine frequency quite a bit.

Edit: [here's a comment I](https://reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/10os40v/_/j6l4bfh/?context=1) made yesterday that has a couple of links with data about this."
10q75pr,Thanks for those links!
10q75pr,That's a great idea...I'll check that out!
10q75pr,"Thanks, that's a good idea!"
10q75pr,"This is the ""high anxiety"" talking! You'll be talking to medical professionals who do this one specific thing for people like us in peri, please stop suffering and go get some relief."
10q75pr,[deleted]
10q75pr,Thanks for the updated info!
10q75pr,"Actually, I googled ""migraine aura"" last night because I just wanted to make sure that my doctor and I were on the same page.  Aura apparently means flashing lights/blind spots, NOT pain and pressure. So I do NOT have aura migraines and therefore wouldn't be in the 'danger' category!  Phew!"
10x4cxn,"Hahahahaha! That was so funny. I recently watched her documentary and walked away feeling like we must protect Pamela Anderson at all costs. LOL. Her charisma, courage, and sense of humor is inspiring."
10x4cxn,"Always loved her, she's spent her life saving animals. She is pure and gentle, the industry tore her apart.
Haven't watched the documentary yet, will get the book. 

One of the most beautiful women to walk the earth!"
10x4cxn,"After I watched the doc, I wanted to write her a letter and tell her how inspiring she is. Also, her son produced or directed the documentary. Not sure which, but you could tell she raised her sons to be good people. I think I must be the only person on earth who had never seen her naked or saw the sex tape, but the nudity in the documentary was done tastefully. Lastly, she downplays Tommy Lee‚Äôs role in their divorce. I think she‚Äôs still protecting her kids, but he actually was a controlling POS. That surprised me."
10x4cxn,[deleted]
10x4cxn,"I cried and laughed and felt she was my best friendüíï    I so love that she never played the victim in any of her hard struggles and how important she was hands with her boys!  I felt so much kindness that she radiates!  Her moms advise when adversity arised... She always told her daughter you have 2 choices you can either shut down or open up and give give give more love ‚ù§Ô∏è 
What a beautiful message! I have such respect for this beautiful badass warrior!!!"
10x4cxn,Watch her documentary on Netflix. She‚Äôs one strong woman.
10x4cxn,I want her to be the vengeful surviving sister of Jennifer Cookidge‚Äôs Tanya in the next season of White Lotus.
10x4cxn,I remember when she used to have a regular column in Jane magazine. She's a gem.
10x4cxn,lol - scrunchie made out of a g-string!!
10x4cxn,"I‚Äôm just watching her documentary,  wow I‚Äôm so impressed that she knew she‚Äôd have to come home to look after her aging parents,  and did!"
10x4cxn,I never thought I‚Äôd have anything in common with her. Lesson learned.:)
10x4cxn,Loved her so much I didn‚Äôt care my husband loved her too!
10x4cxn,She was very likable on the Netflix documentary.  She had a tough life and she has worked hard for her successes.
10x4cxn,I love her too. Her Netflix doc is great!
10x4cxn,I just watched last night and now love and respect her! Loved her hot flash comment. Loving mother and gentle soul.
10x4cxn,"I thought it was really good, and I also have a new found respect for her."
10x4cxn,That was amazing. she‚Äôs funny AND beautiful. And I love that she‚Äôs aging ‚Äúgracefully‚Äù. You can see she‚Äôs done some maintenance but she hasn‚Äôt taken it to an extreme.
10x4cxn,"I never knew much about her so, I‚Äôll be sure to watch this. Recently she was interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel and she was awesome."
10x4cxn,I love it! Brilliant!
10x4cxn,"I love her, she‚Äôs so cool I know we‚Äôd be friends irl üòäüòÜ"
10x4cxn,Just watched the Netflix Documentary. I loved it and really feel for her after everything she has been through. Her boys clearly adore her.
10x4cxn,"I love that this documentary came out ‚Äî and her memoir.  I am exactly her age (55), but I didn‚Äôt know much about her other than I thought she was drop dead gorgeous.  I never watched Baywatch, Home Improvement, etc.  Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure I even knew she had kids.

So, this was her chance to tell her story.  Kinda the same way Britney spoke up at that court hearing and spoke for 25 minutes straight back in June 2021 and had the courage to speak up and speak out.

Not knowing much about her, I have come away from the documentary (and currently reading her memoir) in complete awe at how strong and resilient she is.  I also love that she raised her sons and took them to activities herself.  Love that!

I hope the tide is turning on how women are treated in the entertainment industry."
10x4cxn,"Same.  Watched the doc the other night and adore her.  She‚Äôs so free spirited, loving and fun!"
10x4cxn,"Love her, we are the same age so I grew up with her so to speak. Loved how she filmed her documentary with no makeup on and loose comfy clothing!"
10x4cxn,I didn‚Äôt know much about her before watching - I‚Äôm a big fan now.
10x4cxn,Me too!  I have a new found respect for that woman!
10x4cxn,"I agree.I watched her documentary & really warmed to her she‚Äôs lovely,had no idea she‚Äôd had such a tough life."
10x4cxn,Funny!
10x4cxn,She's amazing.
10x4cxn,"I‚Äôve been a fan for years. I‚Äôm not sure why, but i felt sad after watching the documentary."
10x4cxn,"137am and I'm still up so I'm going to watch her Netflix doc now! (I've given in to the insomnia. I slept until almost 6pm tonight because I couldn't fall asleep until 7am. Tonight, I'm just staying up so I can actually go to WORK tomorrow ü•¥üòëThis sucks!)"
10x4cxn,"Great documentary. It was also a shame what she had to deal with regarding interviews. I can also see how disgusting Matt Lauer, David Letterman and others were to her. She probably felt like she had to just smile and brush it off. Her sons seem really down to earth despite growing up under the glare of the media. I didn't pay much attention to the sex tape issue at the time, but didn't realize her whole SAFE was stolen! And she got humiliated and downright abused when she tried to get it back! Glad she is finally discovering the self love she richly deserves."
10x4cxn,"Yeah, that was actually a cute video!"
10x4cxn,I‚Äôve always liked her!
10x4cxn,And she eats plant based!
10x4cxn,I will definitely watch the documentary!
10x4cxn,I‚Äôve respected her since her PETA days.  She wrote a few op eds in magazines and always thought she was a good writer. I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs embracing her age and wisdom and talents
10x4cxn,Omg she‚Äôs a treasure
10x4cxn,"Thanks for sharing, I read your post this morning and then sat down with my coffee to watch it. It was beautiful!"
10x4cxn,"I mean, she's been battling Hep C for decades, so..."
10x4cxn,"I loved her body when I was a young woman. Absolutely perfect.

Now that she and I are both older, I love her brain.

She must be protected."
10x4cxn,"I‚Äôve always liked her because she never seemed mean spirited or catty. You would expect a bombshell of her caliber to be a diva B-word. I‚Äôm so impressed with this round of Pamela Anderson that we are seeing. Just owning up to all of the woman stuff we all have to deal with. And wow, still so stunning. I absolutely love her just coming out with all of it üôè"
10x4cxn,Of course! She can be one of the new menopause icons. Lol!
10x4cxn,"You know, I've always liked her. She's always strongly supported her beliefs, which I really respect. Somehow, though, I like her more knowing she's suffering like the rest of us üòÇ"
10x4cxn,adding the documentary to my list...
10x4cxn,I love her docu and came away with mad respect for her.
10x4cxn,Where can I see her documentary?
10x4cxn,Totally agree!
10x4cxn,"Watch the doc, you'll love it. She's so sweet"
10x4cxn,"The older son is a producer for the doc.

I think you're absolutely right about her still protecting her kids in regards to their dad. There's a lot of complicated feelings for Tommy going on with her, but she's thinking of her kids first and foremost."
10x4cxn,"Yep, Tommy Lee seemed to be very jealous from all accounts from Baywatch film and crew.  They literally had to change the script whenever he was around bc he didn‚Äôt want scenes of Pam with other men.  I wonder how much more successful she would have been in her acting career without him being so controlling."
10x4cxn,"It is so well done! Props to you. I loved it. 

I used to think she was kind of dumb but sweet. And absolutely stunning, of course. I started watching that show on Hulu, and I felt so gross watching it. Like I was participating in exploiting her even more than those who tried making money off of her private tape. 

The documentary made me so emotional. I related to her abuse and feel nothing but love and admiration for her. She is a lovely human in every way. I am glad she is able to tell her story on her terms.

Just to add- I feel bad that I judged her in the past."
10x4cxn,"So much psychology in the doc, too. You can tell she‚Äôs continually worked on herself. Never bitter, always better. And, so honest; I love how she explained her entry into the Playboy world - ‚Äútaking my sexuality back‚Äù. That‚Äôs a profound statement. The HULU series blew my mind too. I had NO idea the intricacies of the stolen sex tape situation; the hustler v playboy distribution blast; and that she never accepted a dime off the tape, yet it made those a-hole vultures millions. I‚Äôm glad she addressed the resurgence of ‚Äúher story‚Äù from her own narrative. She‚Äôs a badass and her integrity and personality certainly won me over. #ProtectPamela ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10x4cxn,I watched the other day. It was great! Loved how it ended. It's so great to see her shine so brightly on her own terms.
10x4cxn,That would be perfect!
10x4cxn,Right? On the lasts scenes of her documentary all I was thinking was: she needs to be in the white lotus. I feel like she would fit in so well in that show
10x4cxn,Jane magazine! Throwback! Love!
10x4cxn,Pocketbook full of tiny citrus? It‚Äôs common in older women.
10x4cxn,I thought the same thing
10x4cxn,"I guess it depends on what you mean by extreme. I think having a facelift is pretty extreme, and she‚Äôs had more than one. I saw some pictures of her that were distinctly unflattering, her mouth was very weird."
10x4cxn,"Me, too ‚Äî and her hair wasn‚Äôt fixed up either.  So natural!"
10x4cxn,Same!
10x4cxn,I hope you liked it!
10x4cxn,"Ughhh, that IS some bad insomnia. I feel ya and hope better sleep is in your future!"
10x4cxn,"She's actually cured, but really, what does this have to do with anything? Why did you bring this up?"
10x4cxn,"Pamela is a lovely, sweet lady and I hope she is having a great life now. She didn‚Äôt have the best start but she‚Äôs warm and funny and deserves to grow old comfortably."
10x4cxn,It‚Äôs terrific ‚Äî and I started reading her memoir this week.
10x4cxn,Same!
10x4cxn,"It's newly released on Netflix. Here is the link: https://www.netflix.com/title/81590934

üòä"
10x4cxn,Thank you. I was/am a huge fan too and felt really excited to be able to work on it.  I love how it turned out!
10x4cxn,"      *Never bitter, always better*

Love this!"
10x4cxn,Yes! You said it perfectly! She did indeed shine brightly on her own terms.
10x4cxn,"kumquats are great for this: You even eat the peel, so no waste and no pith under your fingernails!"
10x4cxn,I really did!
10x4cxn,Thank you!
10x4cxn,I mention it to highlight she's always been very open and honest about health struggles she's had and she's not one to shy away from subjects others won't discuss.
10x4cxn,"AND, as an aside, you're never ""cured"" from having a virus. I wish that would change in our medical world, but for now that's how it's viewed."
10x4cxn,How‚Äôs the book?
10x4cxn,Thank you!!
10x4cxn,"OMG! I watched it after I commented, and it WAS a kumquat! That really made me laugh."
10x4cxn,Yay!!
10x4cxn,"Hepatitis C can be cured. 
https://www.hepc.com/treating-hep-c"
10x4cxn,I like it so far.  It‚Äôs a mixture of her poetry and narrative writing.  She wrote every word herself with no ‚Äúghost writing‚Äù from another writer.
10x4cxn,Cool!
10tn9o1,"I feel seen. Thank you. ü§£

10tn9o1,"I called the Apple TV the iBox. I thought my son was going to vomit. He also gets huffy when I call the Apple Store the iStore, too. I‚Äôm not even that old but somehow it just happens. You‚Äôre 47 and 87 all at the same time."
10tn9o1,I‚Äôm on day 4 of no power after ice storm in Texas. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I couldn‚Äôt come up with word for COFFEE!!!!  I can‚Äôt find anything as the house is a complete disaster area from stuff just dumped everywhere and moved into smaller area to keep warm‚Ä¶ üòúüò≥üòµ‚Äçüí´
10tn9o1,"Well ... at least you can *find* words... I'm stuck with ""you know, the *thing*... that you use to... do the *thing*..."" and then wind up with an impromptu freaking one-sided game of charades."
10tn9o1,I called the oven a hot box a few days ago.
10tn9o1,I called a state trooper a storm trooper a couple weeks ago.
10tn9o1,I called couldn‚Äôt remember ‚Äúvolume‚Äù the other day and called it ‚Äúsound temperature‚Äù.
10tn9o1,Ha ha ha. I‚Äôve called my husband asking him where the tree scissors are. I also have an annoying habit of using my phone flashlight to look for said phone.
10tn9o1,I once couldn‚Äôt remember the word weather and went to temperature.com
10tn9o1,"Husband was on topamax, which makes you dumber than a box of hair. We had his family over for dinner; he was making fish. He couldn't remember the name for 'meat thermometer'.  He asked - in front of his whole family - ""babe, where's the fish temperature taker?"""
10tn9o1,"No worries. The air fryer is the ""desk oven."""
10tn9o1,"Oh thank you ladies, I needed these today!! I was beginning to think there was something very seriously wrong with me! I've noticed small things slipping over the last few months. I'm kind of a flake sometimes anyway so I hadn't panicked yet. It is maddening when it's right there, it has to be, but your brain absolutely won't give it up."
10tn9o1,"I called my 80-year-old friend in frustration after days of trying to come up with the word for  ""those hot dog on a stick plants that grow by the pond"". 

She nearly wet herself she laughed so hard.

Cattails. They're called cattails. I could think of cat paw, catkin, catalog... Cattails was no longer part of my vocabulary."
10tn9o1,"Totally relate.  I couldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbread‚Äù, ‚Äúknife‚Äù, ‚Äúchair‚Äù or ‚ÄúTom Cruise‚Äù at some point.  I had to elaborately describe those things to my bewildered family in order to get them to help me set the table or in order to tell them the movie we were going to see that night.   It got worse.  I next lost verbal fluency.   Hard to keep a sentence going smoothly when you can‚Äôt pull the words you need from your estrogen-starved neuronal circuitry.  Spelling simple words also became a puzzle I couldn‚Äôt solve.   I‚Äôd endlessly ponder alternative spellings for words I had spelled a million times.  It was almost comical except I had 3 challenging teens, a haphazard husband who depended on me to keep the plates spinning and a corporate job that expected all of my brain to show up 1000% of the time not 50%.  Good times!  

When the uncontrollable rages entered the chat I went straight into my doctor‚Äôs office for HRT NOW!  I couldn‚Äôt get on it fast enough and it saved me.  Truly.  I  hope to be on it forever but that‚Äôs just me.  I‚Äôve seen my brain without estrogen.  It‚Äôs NOT pretty.  No thanks!"
10tn9o1,I called cauliflower white broccoli.
10tn9o1,It works
10tn9o1,Finding other words in place of the word I can‚Äôt recall is happening more.
10tn9o1,The things I've Googled in an attempt to remember basic words lol...

10tn9o1,Same. Ugh. üòÜ

10tn9o1,"This cracked me up! I feel ya, sister."

10tn9o1,Ha ha that's totally awesome üëå I can try to remember it but I know I won't be able üòâ
10tn9o1,I feel this so deeply.  I'm still surprised that I haven't put the car keys in the fridge and the milk in the oven yet.
10tn9o1,Does this get better? I am so worried that this is just how it‚Äôs going to be for the rest of my life‚Ä¶not remembering the word for ‚Äúbook‚Äù
10tn9o1,Mine was asking my husband if he‚Äôd seen my ‚Äúover the ear sound maker things‚Äù and he just looked at me and asked ‚Äúyour headphones?‚Äù
10tn9o1,"listen, sister, that's our language. you say 'tree sticks' to another peri or meno woman and she's bound to understand exactly what you mean...maybe not right away, because of brain fog, but it'll come to her shortly."

10tn9o1,I told my husband that the big dead looking stick in the yard was flowing- its a peach tree
10tn9o1,"I mean you‚Äôre not wrong! ü§≠ Hey! You got the main meaning of whatever you were saying out! May have not been the original words you wanted to use but you got your point across!

10tn9o1,"This. I can say what things DO, but I can't seem to say what they're called. I needed packing tape from the other room, and I said, ""Babe, can you please bring me the ...[thinking] ...stuff that closes boxes? It's sticky.""

10tn9o1,"I take delta 8 gummies sometimes, and have a prescription sleeping pill that I use sometimes too, nothing seems to work if I use it every night. I‚Äôm currently reading a book about using cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, it‚Äôs a six week program. If it works I‚Äôll definitely post about it"
10tn9o1,They are! In this case it was a Offset Spaner Wrench. Technically she wouldn't know the name but she knew what I ment & where it was in the toolbox
10tn9o1,"No it‚Äôs like the word is Dolly Parton but you can‚Äôt say, country, music, blonde etc."
10tn9o1,"Taboo! Look, I remembered a word!!!"
10tn9o1,That‚Äôs the one! Thank you I was searching my brain all night for this.
10r0hqw,I was not on a patch but I stopped cold Turkey. Was Taking testosterone DHEA estrogen and progesterone. Mood better. Calmer. Happier. Since coming off
10r0hqw,"Wean off slowly, so you're less likely to get rebound symptoms.  Depending on where you are in the menopause transition, symptoms may return regardless."
10r0hqw,I‚Äôve weaned myself off once just so I could see where I was without it. I cut my patch to 3/4 size for 3 - 6 mos and then cut it down to 1/2 size for another 3-6 mos and then go completely off. You can only cut your patch if it is is a matrix one and not a reservoir style. My doctor suggested another way to do it is to wear the patch for a longer period of time before changing it out if the adhesive lasts that long.
10r0hqw,"Are you on the patch?  If so, you may want to try vaginal cream hormones.   It only gets absorbed in the vagina and not distributed throughout the body like a patch does.

That's what I've used for over 10 years and it works great for me."
10r0hqw,Oh I intend to! I had a patch fall off once and the mood swings I got from that were enough to let me know I need to be careful. What I'm wanting to know is how slowly to come off.
10r0hqw,"This is helpful, thank you! How was the slow withdrawal, did you have any rebound symptoms?"
10r0hqw,"Oh you can also have estrogen in a vaginal cream? Switching progesterone to vaginal was way better for me, so this could be good!"
10r0hqw,"To be clear, vaginal creams are only meant to target the vagina and are not systemic MHT/HRT.  So localized estrogen treats atrophy **only**, and will not help with anything else, like hot flashes, bone loss, etc.  

However, there are vaginal **systemic** options (like **Femring**) where you insert a ring into your vagina and this delivers estrogen throughout so it does help with symptoms/bone loss.  Femring works up to 3 months."
10r0hqw,Did you notice any weight gain or weight loss?
10r0hqw,"Once I had been completely off for 3 mos, I did have the occasional hot flash at night but nothing like it was in the very beginning. I did have noticeable brain fog and my vaginal atrophy did come back so I went back on the estradiol cream rather quickly. I stayed off the HRT for about 5-6 mos before I went back on it. The main reason I went back is for the potential positive effect on bone, heart and brain health."
10r0hqw,I do Estrace cream and it has helped with hot flashes and anxiety.
10r0hqw,Neither.  I stayed the same.
10r0hqw,"right, it's a low dose cream meant for vaginal atrophy.  While it *might* be helping with hot flashes, it's not likely doing much for bone loss."
110q7bj,"It might be dependent on where you're at in your perimenopause.  In peri, hormones are swinging, so the addition of MHT/HRT can mean that estrogen will be higher at times which contributes to nausea.  

If you're consistently feeling this way, then you might want to take a look at your dosages and/or method of delivery."
110q7bj,I was sick throughout pregnancy. I‚Äôve been fine with two different types of HRT so far. I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. It must be utterly miserable. X
110q7bj,"I had HG in both pregnancies and needed hospitalisation. Been on HRT for about 3 weeks now with no morning sickness like symptoms. I'd be thoroughly gutted if that happens. 
However eating before 11 am ish now makes me nauseous, which is interesting"
110q7bj,I haven't started taking anything but I am getting morning sickness in general which I had no idea was a symptom of peri-menopause.
110q7bj,Had very bad morning sickness. Never tolerated BC. Have been fine on HRT from the start but I am on low dose estradiol only.
110q7bj,I had 9 months of morning sickness and no problems with hrt on a high dose. Sorry you‚Äôre going through it. Have you definitely ruled out being pregnant?
110q7bj,Estrogen gave me morning sickness.  I lasted 2 months before I stopped.   I'm still on progesterone and testosterone with no issues.
110q7bj,"Thank goodness you have a positive experience. I went from fear after reading the original post to quickly scanning the comments for anyone that is ok. I haven‚Äôt started HRT but if it makes me as sick as I was during pregnancy, I wouldn‚Äôt be to take/use it."
110q7bj,Yah hysterectomy.  My coworker asked the same thing.
10q6zen,"I had shingles on my face at age 38. It was HORRIBLE. I have never felt such extreme itchiness, my hair was so sensitive - I could literally feel each strand of hair on my head where the sores were. It left me with pain that lingered for months. I am 10 years out and will still occasionally feel an off sensation where I had the outbreak. Get the shot."
10q6zen,"Yes, it is a 2 vaccine course.  It made me feel like I had the flu until about mid-afternoon on day 2.  Not a big deal and so worth it to not get shingles."
10q6zen,"My x got shingles when we were together and it was horrible for him. While that was like ten years ago, I remembered his experience so well that for my 50th, I got the first shot that day. 

FWIW, that vax knocked me on my ass both times. Covid and flu shots didn‚Äôt phase me."
10q6zen,"I did got a rare form of Shingles years ago at 33 years old. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is no joke, that's pretty scary to experience. Recently Justin Bieber got it and shared his experience on social media. Long story short, half my face was paralyzed completely for months. It did takes 3 months to recover partially and an other 6 months for the rest to go away. I needed to sleep with my eyelid taped to keep it closed so my eye does not dry out. I could not eat properly and my hearing was damaged but recovered after a while. I was terrified to get stuck like that. Because it is possible to keep aftermath. Im lucky to have 95% recovered, only me can see it now.
Recently I‚Äôve got vaccinated for it (shingles vaccine). So I encourage anyone to get vaccinated!"
10q6zen,Ok! I guess I‚Äôm getting the shots!
10q6zen,"PSA for people who don't know if they ever had chicken pox: your dr. can order a blood test for you that will detect whether you've ever had it. If you didn't, you can get that vaccine instead. The CP vaccine was approved for use in the US in 1995, so probably quite a few of us in this sub didn't get it part of the normal childhood vaccination schedule (I didn't)."
10q6zen,My friend from work got shingles and told me it ruined his life. He ended up with nerve pain and it will probably never go away. Could not work.It takes at least a year or two to get social security disability and during that time he lost his house. He told me get vaccinated. Both times it felt like I had the flu but just for 2 days. I'd say that's well worth it to prevent a lifetime of pain and disability.
10q6zen,"Get the vaccine. I had shingles when I was 11, and do not wish to repeat the experience. Do not hesitate. It is so worth it!"
10q6zen,"My pharmacist said it was okay for me. I have some autoimmune disorders and was scared of a reaction. I was fine, no reaction besides a sore arm from the other vaccines I had on the same day."
10q6zen,I have been utterly terrified of shingles since my music teacher developed it when I was in 5th grade. He had a terrible time and wasn't able to work for months. I am so grateful there is a vaccine and have been counting down the days until I'm eligible to get it. 421 days to go!
10q6zen,I got it! Shingles is way worse than the vaccine!
10q6zen,My husband and my parents have all had the vaccine. No problems at all. I plan to get the vaccine when I hit the recommended age. I wouldn't wish shingles on my worst enemy. I've seen too many people suffer terribly with it.
10q6zen,First shot had no side effects. Second shot was like the flu for a day. Not horrible.
10q6zen,My mom had the shingles vaccine several years ago. She did get shingles after but it was one spot and didnt cause any issues. Definitely recommend.
10q6zen,"Yeah this is something I've been debating too.  My doctor says 'nah you're healthy', but I'm thinking I should get it."
10q6zen,"It hurts, but not as bad as shingles."
10q6zen,"Never had the vaccine, but got shingles in my mid 30‚Äôs.  (Had chicken pox as a kid). Very mild, I honestly thought I had sat in some poison Ivy or something, because it was centered around my thighs.  Was VERY itchy, but not painful.  Gave it to both my kids, and my husband (who never had CP as a kid).  It was HORRIBLE for him- very painful, covered his entire body.  Definitely get the vaccine."
10q6zen,"I'm under 50 so they don't want to give me this, but I would take it tomorrow if they weren't going to fight me. I had shingles on my face and head under my hair. It was horrible and they say that you usually get it in the same location if you get it again. I never want that again. I had to do so much work to get the anti viral eyedrops because no one keeps them in stock due to them going bad quickly and rarely being needed, but I could have gone blind without them."
10q6zen,I had the shingles flu and Covid booster all on the same day. Zero side effects.
10q6zen,"I had a mild case of shingles quite a while back, and it sucked enough to convince me to get the vaccine as soon as I was eligible. I had no problems with it at all. Well, I guess the injection site and a circle around it maybe about the size of my hand got red and itchy a few days after my first dose, but that just went away on its own after a day or two."
10q6zen,I got the shingles vaccine.  Just a teeny bit of arm tenderness at the injection site. I‚Äôve had more painful sneezes.
10q6zen,I would get your mom to another doctor and get her the shingles vaccine. And definitely get it yourself.  My mom had this as well as one of my neighbours and it is freaking horrible.
10q6zen,"Everyone I know who has had shingles hated it and strongly, strongly, strongly encourages everyone else to get the vaccine. So I got it as soon as I was eligible. I didn‚Äôt have any reaction to the shots."
10q6zen,"I had it.  Both doses put me down for an entire day with flu like symptoms and my arm was extremely painful for a week after.  Don't go by me, though, I'm one of those people who can experience side effects from a tic tac.  But I won't be experiencing shingles!"
10q6zen,"Yes, no problems"
10q6zen,Another thing to get - never had the chickenpox vaccine so I guess I need that and shingles. Do people get them at pharmacies? I have completely blanked to getting them
10q6zen,"My stepdad got shingles that took up residence in his ear/facial muscles (Ramsey Hunt syndrome). Followed a few months later by a thankfully mild stroke, but he still has some issues from it almost a year later when he was previously very active and healthy. Getting shingles increases your risk for stroke and a whole host of other issues (the particular type of shingles he got further increased his risk of a stroke). Get the shingles vaccine."
10q6zen,"Yes get the vaccine. It may (or may not) make you feel kind of bad for a bit, but it‚Äôs better than having shingles. My husband had it a few years ago and was miserable. Also, everyone at his work freaked out and they wouldn‚Äôt let him come in to work for a week."
10q6zen,"GET IT!

I had very mild soreness in my arm after both shots, but even if they'd made me moderately ill I'd still recommend them. Shingles is HORRIBLE. Do anything and everything to avoid it."
10q6zen, Get the shot! I was worried about getting it because I read about side effects but it went well. I have fibromyalgia and didn‚Äôt want to deal with anything else!
10q6zen,"OMG, it's awesome. I got shingles when I was in my mid-40s. It was truly a living hell. I went on to have three--THREE--recurrences because, yeah, shingles keeps coming back. As soon as I was eligible, I got the Shingrix vaccine and it was life-changing. I don't have as much as a tickly twinge on my shingles nerve now. I was a bit fatigued and achy the day after the first of the two shots, but nothing like what I experienced with my Covid vaccination. Anyway, I can't stress enough how miserable an experience shingles is. I was in the acute phase for over a month and then I had post-herpetic neuralgia for a whole freakin' year. Miserable."
10q6zen,"The first shot bottomed me out for the weekend. I braced for the 2nd shot and it was nothing! 

My mom had shingles before she died and it was horrible. We admitted her to hospital and they kept trying to take her temperature but it wouldn‚Äôt read on their instrument. They found an ‚Äúold fashioned‚Äù thermometer to measure her and her body temp was 95F or some such (too low / out of range for that first instrument). She was heartbreakingly uncomfortable. Get the shots, everyone!"
10q6zen,I will absolutely get it in a few months when I turn 50. Shingles is horrific and can become a chronic debilitating issue.
10q6zen,"I would recommend. 2nd shot was the worst. IF you got the Covid vaccine, about the same experience."
10q6zen,"Hubby and I have both had the series of two Shingrix shots. It affected both of us about the same: We felt pretty crappy the next day and our arms were sore for a couple of days, but that was it. A friend had shingles, and it was definitely worth it to avoid that!"
10q6zen,"My mom got shingles late in life and it paralyzed her for a while.  She had to get rehab.  She never got a chance to get the vax.  It‚Äôs painful and the older you are they worse it is. If your doc recommends it, I‚Äôd do it."
10q6zen,"I got it as soon as I could after turning 50 (the point at which insurance would cover it). My father had shingles on and off for years, including lingering nerve pain. It was awful.  


I didn't feel great the day or two after each shot, but it passed quickly and is nothing in comparison with how poorly shingles can make you feel. GET THE SHOTS!"
10q6zen,"Had shingles last winter at 48, was ready to die from the pain, had it on my face. Got the vaccine as soon as my dr would let me, just had a sore arm."
10q6zen,Got this 2 part shingle vaccine last summer and fall (age 58).  Zero side effects with either shot. Wasn‚Äôt all covered by insurance but worth it to prevent shingles.
10q6zen,I know a couple of people who have gotten shingles in their forties. It looks awful. The vaccine is in my to do list.
10q6zen,My plan is to schedule my next checkup after my birthday (50) so that hopefully I‚Äôll get the Shingles vax - I know 2 people (50 and 75) who‚Äôve had it in the last year and their experiences sounded AWFUL.
10q6zen,Yep! It was fine.
10q6zen,"My arm hurt a lot for the first shot, but having seen my husband deal with shingles, I‚Äôd much rather deal with 2 days of arm pain."
10q6zen,"Had both shots and felt fine (but I never feel great-SAD, old, and sore is my baseline)."
10q6zen,I got the two after my mother had it!! Omg do not want it ever.  I had no reaction to the vaccines.
10q6zen,"I had no reaction to the first but was SO sick after the second. I had a fever, nausea, and body aches. But I woukd face it all again just to reduce the likelihood of getting shingles."
10q6zen,I had both shots last year. I felt fine afterwards.
10q6zen, I got both doses of the vaccine and had no side effects.
10q6zen,"I recommend getting the shot on a day before a day off, just in case you have some side effects.  My pharmacist said the new formula is way better than the first version. She also had an 80 yr old customer ( who had had the old formula) just go blind from shingles getting into his eyes- poor thing!"
10q6zen,"I felt fatigued for a day. 

My tough farmer FIL - who has broken his back twice- says Shingles was the worst thing that happened to him. 

Worth it to get the shot."
10q6zen,I had the new vaccine in 2 doses. I became feverish and achey about a day and half after each dose.
10q6zen,Get the shots. My bestie got shingles and was mizzzzzeeable
10q6zen,"Husband and I got our 2nd shots a few weeks ago. Neither of us had side effects from the first shot. Husband had no side effects from second shot. I had flu-like symptoms starting the same night I got the shot (got the shot in the morning). Lasted about 24 hours. If I don‚Äôt get shingles, it‚Äôll be well worth it."
10q6zen,"I got it at 50 and had a sore arm, nothing else!"
10q6zen,"I got the shingle shots last year, I had no problems with any side effects."
10q6zen,"Just got my 2nd shot a few weeks ago. No reaction from it or the 1st one, just a sore arm.

Had chickenpox as a kid and heard about shingles and want. No. Part. Of. That.

It's hard enough keeping everything together and in check as it is. Breaking out in a hot, nasty rash? I would end up on the evening news."
10q6zen,"I've had both shots. I felt achy and feverish after both vaccines but not for too long, maybe a couple of days. I know several people that have suffered through having shingles and my mother-in-law has a deep scar on her face from a bout with it 30 years ago."
10q6zen,I‚Äôve had shingles twice. In 2 more years I‚Äôm eligible for the vaccine and I can‚Äôt wait to get it.
10q6zen,I did the Shingrix vaccine when I turned 50 last year. After both doses I felt achy and fatigued after about 6-8 hours (feels like the flu) and the symptoms lasted for about 16 hours or so. It‚Äôs not fun but not horrible and there‚Äôs relief in knowing the feeling will pass. Definitely do it if you don‚Äôt have any allergies to vaccines and do it over a weekend/when you have a couple of days to rest and relax at home.
10q6zen,"It's a very good vax, but strong. Shot 1 made me itch, but shot 2 laid me out pretty good for a couple of days. There was a reformulation some time ago that made it both much more effective and much more side-effecty. Even so, much much better than shingles."
10q6zen,"A coworker said it was very painful, but I had no issues like that. In the last few years I've had covid vac shot, 2nd shot a month later, 4 boosters, a flu shot, and 2 shingles shots. 
The last was a pneumonia shot and a tetanis in the same arm. Done at the doc office (instead of my others recieved at CVS or Walmart and my first 2 covid at a county event.) Afterwards, I didn't even have a sore or red and warm arm. Makes me wonder if the technique that is used by the nurse in the doctor's office makes a difference.

Edited because what I typed made little sense."
10q6zen,Had shingles and missed one week of work needed pain meds. Got the vaccine later. It was an innocuous inoculation.  No problems.
10q6zen,What kind of doctor of geriatric patients advises against the shingles vaccine?
10q6zen,Got my second Shingrix dose same day as my COVID vax booster. Did feel some flu like symptoms the next day (not sure which shot caused it) . But totally fine after that!
10q6zen,I have it in my eye. Three years later it still stings. Get the vaccine.
10q6zen,"I have gotten both shots of Shingrix within the past year. Some very manageable side effects after the first shot, almost none with the second shot. Way better than getting shingles imo."
10q6zen,Does anyone know  if you can get it before you're 50?  I just turned 49 and I'm terrified of getting shingles. I don't want to wait another year for the vaccine.
10q6zen,"I can't wait to get it. A co-worker developed shingles in her eye. You don't want that.

FYI, I think it protects for 10 years and there is no booster."
10q6zen,Yes. After the 1st one I was tired for a couple of days. After the 2nd dose I had a headache on the 2nd day. However being in peri I get headaches so not sure what caused that one.
10q6zen,I had shingles last year. I was 45. It was the worst pain I‚Äôve ever had. Ever. I got the first dose and I need to go back for my second. The pharmacist said it used to be the worst vaccine to get before the  Covid vaccine. My arm was sore and I was a little tired but nothing else.
10q6zen,"I had a very very mild case of shingles a few years ago with Valtrex and it was terrible!  When I looked at photos online and saw much worse cases, I can't IMAGINE what that would be like because a mild case was a huge inconvenience and lingered. Incredibly painful. 

and it can cause permanent damage. Imagine getting it in your head. or your eyes.  UGHHHHH

I got vaccinated! and I felt pretty bad after the first shot. 

Totally worth it."
10q6zen,Shingles is awful. My mom had to cancel everything for a couple of months when she had it. I'm getting the shingles vaccine as soon as I'm eligible
10q6zen,"My arm hurt like a mo fo, but better than getting shingles all over your body or face and suffering horrific nerve pain forever."
10q6zen,I never had chicken pox so ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt *think* I need to get the shingles vaccine? But thank you for reminding me that I need to check on that.
10q6zen,Anyone know the youngest they'll give this vaccine? I had pox as a toddler and I got HSV as an adult. Very worried about shingles.
10q6zen,"The shingles vaccines hit me harder than the Pfizer COVID vaccines, but I am glad I got them. My dad had shingles in one of his eyes, and it was  truly awful."
10q6zen,I got the vaccine as soon as I was eligible.   No side effects at all.  My Mom had shingles years ago and it was awful.  No way was I taking a chance of getting it.
10q6zen,I got the first one without any side effects and heard the second one is the one that may bring in flu like symptoms ‚Ä¶.I‚Äôll find out soon enough! ü•¥
10q6zen,I heard the horror stories about shingles so got the vax as soon as I was eligible. Sore arm. No other side effects. Good luck!
10q6zen,"I have a primary immune deficiency in addition to being over fifty.

I got the first shot six months ago and am getting the second one this Friday. I asked all my doctors and they all agreed I should have the shot, especially since I've had shingles twice (first time when I was 17...yay immune system).

The first shot did nothing as far as side effects go, although I am told the second one is the one that does that, so I scheduled it for a Friday so I can just curl up in a ball that night and all day Saturday."
10q6zen,"It's a two dose vaccination. The first one felt like I had the flu, so be prepared to take it easy and rest, three months later I got the second and it wasn't bad at all, a little tired and headache but a lot less misery. 

I got a shingles attack one time and it felt like an itchy fire all over. I never want to feel that way again."
10q6zen,I got the first dose shot over a year ago and can still feel pain where it was inserted. My dr thinks the pharmacist gave it too high up or in a bad place. I‚Äôm not getting the second one due to this ongoing pain. My husband got both shots without any problems.
10q6zen,"I had the vax and had no side effects at all with the first (I do have chronic neck pain and headaches, so if it impacted that I may not have noticed). I got the second shot with my flu shot and I felt quite fatigued for a couple of days but nothing more severe than that. 

I do have a coworker that had a very hard time with the first shot and her dr told her to not get the second and that she still has some protection from the first. Still better than getting shingles, though."
10q6zen,Not too bad as vaccines go in general. Arm was more sore than other vaccines.
10q6zen,"I got the two dose vaccine. It hit me harder than any of my Covid vaccines.  My grandmother,  mother, and brother have all had shingles.  I'd much rather have a bad vaccine reaction than go through having shingles."
10q6zen,"I just had the two shots recently at my local pharmacy.  I am 53.  I was fine. I got a bit tired. I even had one of them at the same time as the flu shot. 

I had HORRID reaction to Pfizer covid booster, though.  Nerve pain in every single nerve ending and in bed for two days."
10q6zen,"I had a very mild bout of shingles in my mid 30's. It was a spot on my back that was maybe 2 inches in diameter, and it felt like I had gotten sunburn on top of poison ivy, and then the same spot had been bitten by mosquitos and stung by bees. It was also in a spot that was nearly impossible to see or reach just below my shoulder blade. It left the skin a weird texture for nearly a year, and I had little nerve pains for several years. I was told that I was lucky because it was in such a small area, and it was nowhere near my eyes. Even still 0/5 stars...do not recommend. Get the vaccine!"
10q6zen,"I got both shots last year - I didn't have any issues with the first shot but the second shot made my arm really sore and I felt under the weather for a couple of days. Totally worth it to avoid shingles, IMO."
10q6zen,"Shot one, felt shitty for a few days. Shot two, sore arm. No big deal!"
10q6zen,"I got it about 6 months ago. I didn't feel particularly bad afterward, \*but\* it was a painful shot, both times. It does hurt, and it does leave you with a sore arm for a few days. I have been told that the shot is much preferable to the agony of actually having shingles, though."
10q6zen,Had it two years ago and it has minimized several cold sores - I‚Äôm grateful for that alone!
10q6zen,"It was the first vaccine that I had a reaction to, but I'd rather have that than the shingles."
10q6zen,"The new vaccine is ‚Äúdead‚Äù. That‚Äôs why some doctors didn‚Äôt advise for the old ‚Äúlive‚Äù one, it had more side effects and could give you shingles. I just had my 1st vaccine last week. I didn‚Äôt feel amazing for a few days but it could have been something else. They told me when I come back for #2 don‚Äôt plan anything for the next day, just in case."
10q6zen,"I‚Äôve had the vaccines. Pretty mild side effects, as far as I recall. One thing to note is that they‚Äôre expensive, and may not be covered on insurance without a prescription. My husband and I both got the shots and without a prescription, they would have cost $600.  With one from my doctor, the cost was $80.00."
10q6zen,Never had chicken pox as a kid and confirmed by testing. I had the chicken pox vaccine at 28. Not one doctor can confirm if I should or shouldn‚Äôt need the vaccine for shingles but they all say why not.
10q6zen,Get the vaccine. A sore arm and maybe a day of feeling blah is far better than the severe pain and potentially permanent neuralgia.
10q6zen,"I got shingles when I was 39 while training for an Ironman. I had an incredibly mild case and didn‚Äôt even need to take any meds for it. It was just soooo itchy it drove me nuts. A little strange nerve stuff but since I was about 1 month out from the race, I attested a lot of it towards suddenly having to take a week off all exercise when I was used to 4-6 hours of biking/running/swimming everyday. 
I do need to get the shot now that I just turned 50. Not excited about it as people say it makes them feel horrible. But I remind myself I had a mild case!"
10q6zen,I have. Sore arm afterwards. A small price to pay for ensuring a shingle-free future.
10q6zen,I got the 2 shot vaccine and it made me tired for a couple of days and made my arm hurt for a week. I would definitely recommend getting the vaccine but would also recommend getting it in your non-dominant arm. I‚Äôve had so many relatives get shingles and they can be brutal.
10q6zen,I was pretty tired for 24 hours but never felt bad. Arm was a bit sore. It was over a year ago. GET YOUR VACCINE!!
10q6zen,"Yes. I saw it pop up in my medical chart (app) and was like ‚ÄúWTF, I don‚Äôt need this‚Ä¶‚Äù then read an article about how your risk for shingles goes up a ton once you hit 50 so I got it. COVID / Flu vaccines haven‚Äôt bothered me much but this one put me down. I was exhausted afterwards and my arm hurt like hell for a couple of days. But, yeah, definitely get it. My doctor was saying how terrible shingles can be. Not worth the risk. Still need to get my 2nd dose."
10q6zen,"No, because I‚Äôve never had chicken pox! I have gas the chicken pox vaccine, though!"
10q6zen,I‚Äôve had one and I‚Äôm due for my second. Not looking forward to it! I‚Äôve heard the second shot  side affects are bad. We‚Äôll see.
10q6zen,No issues other than scheduling it. My hmo kept pushing it and then when I called to schedule it took two months.
10q6zen,"I had shingles when I was 11. I have a SUPER high pain tolerance, and it was one of the most excruciating things I can remember happening in my childhood. It was worse than my appendix almost rupturing, chronic migraines, and getting kicked around by the animals on my grandmother's farm.

When my doc told me to schedule it, I was thrilled; I thought I had to wait til 55.

I had no problem with the first injection, getting my second next month."
10q6zen,"I got my vaccine and it wasn't a big deal.   
I might not have prioritized at all until a young and healthy coworker got shingles. Her experience seemed like absolute agony. The case was intense, lasted months, and had spread to a few parts of her body. Her experience with shingles was my motivation to get the shot as soon as it was suggested to me."
10q6zen,"I‚Äôm getting the shingles vaxx and the nurse told me to plan on feeling flu-like symptoms for up to 3 days. Then if I have no reaction, enjoy the time off. 

I have had shingles multiple times and it‚Äôs horrific. Although with medication it greatly lowers into the ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù pain scale. 

Chickenpox virus looming in my body for 30+ years, then rearing it‚Äôs monstrous head as shingles is what concerns me most about getting covid!!"
10q6zen,Had the shingles at age 45.  Got the shingles shots.  Felt like I had a flu/cold coming on the next day.  10/10 would do it again just so I don‚Äôt experience the shingles again.
10q6zen,Pretty comparable to the Covid vaccine for me. Two doses a month apart. Felt run down and feverish for a day each time. SO WORTH IT to never get shingles.
10q6zen,I had FIVE shingles on the right side of my chest just under my bra‚Ä¶I thought I would lose my mind! I got the vax. I never want that to happen again!
10q6zen,"Got my first dose a couple weeks ago. Left arm. Arm hurt for about a week, but it‚Äôs my non-dominant arm. Some swelling. I started massaging it around day 4 and it started feeling better. 
Chicken pox laid me out for 3 weeks as a kid. I do not want shingles and will gladly deal with side effects."
10q6zen,"I got them, they were rough, but not as rough as shingles."
10q6zen,"I‚Äôve had my first shingrix and am waiting for the 2nd. I think it might give better results if a bit father apart. They ask you do to the 2nd 2-6 mos after the first. I never react to the flu shot, have had about 36 hours of fever and pain from mRNA covid vaxes 2-5 (no reaction to 1 except sore arm). Shingrix made me feel crappy for several days but nothing like what i saw my husband with shingles in his 30s or a couple friends recently in their 50s. I am going to do my #2 dose on a Friday so it shouldn‚Äôt mess up my work."
10q6zen,Vax is rough.  Shingles is worse.
10q6zen,"I got my 2nd shot today. Felt lightheaded and had to nap. But that could have been due to the painful pap test I had done just before. Oh and the horrible period cramping I had for 3 days prior.  I dont remember anything after the 1st shot. My mom got shingles a couple years ago, just a small spot. She had gotten the older vaccine."
10q6zen,I got the two-vaccine series at 57 and the only reaction was a very sore arm for a few days with the first shot. I recommend you get it.
10q6zen,"I‚Äôm getting my second in the series this weekend. My mother had shingles in her eyes, and I don‚Äôt want to go through that."
10q6zen,"Got mine when I turned 50. Insurance should cover if. It‚Äôs a two dose vaccination. Nerve pain from Shingles can last months and is extremely painful. Be warned though, the second shot is a little painful. My Pharmacist told me his Mom cussed him out when he gave her the second dose. üòÇ"
10q6zen,"I've had the vax and had zero side effects. I had a mild case of shingles years ago, got lucky and caught it early, so didn't suffer too badly. I don't want to take my chances again!"
10q6zen,"These are great comments with lots of good info. Reading them makes me want to get the vax ASAP. I don‚Äôt want Shingles as is sounds terrible. I am fairly sure I‚Äôve read that you need to be 50 to get it, though, and I‚Äôm 48. Does anyone know?"
10q6zen,I had shingles at 38 and I‚Äôm counting down till my 50th bday to get my Shingrix shot!
10q6zen,My 74 yr old mother has it right now on her face! Running to the dr for my shots.
10q6zen,"I got the first one a few week's back and felt like I had the flu for a day. Better than Shingles, but I wasn't expecting such a strong reaction."
10q6zen,I had my first dose with no side effects other than soreness at the injection site like a flu shot. Highly recommend getting it done. Shingles sounds awful!
10q6zen,"My mom had shingles at 80. It was horribly painful, and it lasted for months. She had the 2 doses of vaccine last year. I think you are supposed to wait 6 months before you get the vaccine after shingles. My mom said she never wanted to go through that again. After seeing what she went through, I got the vaccine too. I have little doubt the rural doctor's opinion would change if he or she ever has to suffer through shingles."
10q6zen,"I had Shingles at age 50. It was an absolute nightmare (because it was on my face and in my left eye).

Have not had the vaccines yet because it‚Äôs hard to plan around missing work to suffer the side effects. Every vaccine gives me problems (fatigue, mild fever, body aches) but I know I can‚Äôt keep dodging these shots.

I‚Äôve had 4 COVID vaccines and they all kicked my butt, as do the annual flu vaccines."
10q6zen,I‚Äôve watched so many people suffer horribly with shingles. As soon as I hit 50 I got the vaccine. Absolutely no regrets and no issues.
10q6zen,"Thanks to this thread and sub, I got my Shingles vaccine yesterday. I'm not sure I would have gotten around to doing it if I hadn't have read this thread in its entirety. Those stories scared the bejeezus out of me and I realized I absolutely could not afford to have this happen to me, so...thank you!"
10q6zen,I got the flu vaccine and the shingles vaccine done together last spring and I had a flu like reaction for 3 or 4 days. Other women I know have had similar reactions but I'm sure it's better than having shingles. I would definitely plan to get it on a Friday and plan to be down for the weekend plus a day or 2. It was way worse than the COVID vaccine for me.
10q6zen,"Get shingrix. I had shingles on the right side of my face. It caused extreme pain, and the damaged nerves continue to hurt to the point of not letting me sleep. If shingles doesn't scare you, look up PHN. It's been 18 months for me."
10q6zen,I had both doses with little fanfare.
10q6zen,"My husband and I both had it right when we turned 50 as it was recommended by our doctors. My Mom had shingles and it seemed really painful and lasted a long time. I felt a little tired the second shot and my arm hurt a little, not a big deal."
10q6zen,I scheduled both doses on Fridays.  I spent the weekends after feeling like I had the flu.  It was still worth it not to get shingles.  Anyone I know who has gotten shingles has said the pain is excruciating.  Some were left with permanent nerve damage (I have MS so I already have enough of that to deal with).
10q6zen,"I did a double vaccine both times - one of my shingles shots was with a flu shot in the other arm, and the follow up with was a Covid booster shot. So, yeah. Mildly flu-like feelings and a sore arm for a day or two. The shingles sides were worse than the other shots. But I was so glad to get them, having heard horror stories about Shingles. Really no big deal - I did mine on fairly quiet weekends so I could lay around in bed if I needed to."
10q6zen,"I have had both shots. The first one gave me every injection site reaction - red, swollen, itchy, sore. I will take that any day over getting shingles."
10q6zen,"I found it to be the most painful of any vaccine, both doses.  However, the sore arm is still a ton better than being stricken with Shingles."
10q6zen,"I cannot take ANYTHING!  My body does not process medication etc like it‚Äôs supposed to. Usually I trust my immune system WAY more than my bodies ability to process foreign substances.
However, I am spooked about Shingles as I had a horrible time with chicken pox when I was young.  
I don‚Äôt trust most medical professionals from years of misdiagnosis with both my PMDD and my genetic mutations and being wrongly medicated.
I‚Äôm definitely in a quandary with this however. üò©"
10q6zen,Yep. I‚Äôve done mine more than a year ago. Have had no issues at all.
10q6zen,"I got my first of 2 shots last month. Had a really sore arm for a couple days, but no major problems. Going to get the second shot next week."
10q6zen,I have had the vaccines (2 of them) and they do make you feel crummy for a day or so. However I would rather choose when I feel crummy vs letting the virus and my immune system decide. I have had relatives who have had it and it was very painful.
10q6zen,"My arm was sore for a couple of days after each shot. Strongly recommend getting the vaccine, much easier than Shingles. 

If your mom is over her case of Shingles, she should get the vax too. Shingles is not a once and done, it can come back. 

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html"
10q6zen,I‚Äôm so terrified of shingles I got the first dose of the vaccine ON my 50th birthday. Both shots made me feel gross for a day but I‚Äôll take that over shingles any day.
10q6zen,"Hurt worse than a tetnus shot, felt crappy for a day or two.  Going back for second one on Friday.  I'll check back then.  I've heard shingles is miserable.   I remember chicken pox being pretty miserable too."
10q6zen,"Like other commenters, I had the 2 dose of Shingrix. Arm hurt like hell for a day or so after each injection but having the shingles is worse so it was worth it.

Tylenol for pain and a cold compress helped out. Asked the pharmacist if in the future would I need a booster or anything, she said no, this 2 dose should be all we need."
10q6zen,"I got my first shot a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm 51. Sore arm for a few days, muscle aches the day after. I was dragging my feet on getting the vaccine until I read a news story recently that said risk of stroke can increase and persist long-term after a case of the Shingles."
10q6zen,"I'm 54 and had my first dose early in September, second dose is this Friday.  I had absolutely no side effects from the first one, but a friend of mine said she had nothing on shot 1 but felt like she had the flu after shot 2. So we shall see what happens for me. After my last combo flu/COVID booster in December I had some wicked shoulder pain in that arm for like a week. I hope I don't have a reaction like that again."
10q6zen,"I don‚Äôt qualify for the vaccine for another two weeks. I‚Äôm getting it as soon as I qualify.

My eldest son developed shingles when he was 18. It was horrifying."
10q6zen,"I‚Äôve had shingles twice.  Once when I was 26 and the dr didn‚Äôt believe I had it until the window of treating it had passed.  It‚Äôs not horrible.  Down a few days.  Sore, a little nerve damage on the first round.  Not sure what‚Äôs in the vaxx but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs worse for the way older set."
10q6zen,"My hubby and I just got the first dose of Shingrix vaccine about 2 weeks ago. No issues except sore shoulder. One thing to note is that you cannot get any other vaccine for 5 weeks after you get the Shingrix vaccine. We are both due for next round of Covid booster and will have to wait. Shot #2 for Shingrix is due in 6 months. Apparently, the side effects from second shot are flu like symptoms for a day or 2."
10q6zen,My arm was sore AF for 5 days. Very sleepy. Way worse than COVID vax! But I survived. :)
10q6zen,Increased inflammation of existing neck pain and triggered a TMJ flare after the second dose. Might have had an impact on my thyroid as well but it‚Äôs harder to connect.
10q6zen,Agreed. People who have had shingles told me the vaccine side effects are far less unpleasant than the real thing.
10q6zen,Same
10q6zen,"That's crazy how different the immune responses are between people. For me, flu and shingles vax? Nothing. Covid shot 1, booster #1, and booster #2? Nada.

Covid Vax #2? 12 hours of pure ick."
10q6zen,"Interesting! The first few Covid vaccines all gave me 12 hours of mild ick and an arm sore enough to wake me when I turned over at night, but then the bivalent booster (plus flu vax) gave me 24 hours of ick and a trailing day of exhaustion with no arm pain. 

I'm scheduling my Shingrix for Friday night just in case."
10q6zen,"Yes do it!  I got shingles when I was a sophomore in college and it sucked.  I think the only decision here is strategically what age to get it to maximize the benefit, and your doctor can help you out with that.  Plus maybe discuss holding out for the newer vaccine which is supposed to be more effective.  Good luck!"
10q6zen,"Oh, thank you so much for this info."
10q6zen,So our kids (Gen Z) that got the CP vaccine won‚Äôt have to worry about shingles?  Or only if you never actually got chicken pox?
10q6zen,"So if my first round of the pox was in kinder in '90, should I not get shingles vaccine?"
10q6zen,"Thank you! I've never had chicken pox and am also not vaxed against it. I will definitely ask my doctor to test just in case, and then vaxed for that instead if possible!"
10q6zen,"Also, just get the Shingles vax. I actually got the Chicken Pox vax as an adult (no record of having CP as a child) and still didn't register any immunity for it. Got shingles near my eye and down my trigeminal nerve on my face. Very painful. Had to wait 1 year to get vaxxed."
10q6zen,Post herpetic neuralgia is the condition that fries your nerve endings
10q6zen,"My husband had shingles in his mid 20s and has a big patch of nerve damage on his back. He‚Äôs in his 50s now, so I can attest it does not go away or even subside."
10q6zen,Another who has nerve pain.  It's awful.I got shingles about 10 years ago after doing a fast.  I guess it stressed out my immune system.  It does help the nerve pain a little to use a capsaicin cream and be sure vitamin B levels are good.
10q6zen,A coworker got it last year in her eye. She was off work for months and will probably never get full vision back in that eye. Get the shot.
10q6zen,"L-lysine, lots & lots. Worth a shot (it‚Äôs anti-viral. Tell him to look it up for shingles.)"
10q6zen,This is why my husband and I were vaccinated. Shingles is very painful.
10q6zen,Agree with this. I completed the series and had a sore arm for a day each time.
10q6zen,A new study came out that said there is a significant increase in the risk of a stroke after a case of Shingles. That‚Äôs why I just got mine.
10q6zen,"This sounds like it \*was\* poison ivy or similar.  Shingles is only going to show up on one side of your body, not both, and you can not give it to anyone else."
10q6zen,"I agree, sounds like it wasn‚Äôt shingles. It‚Äôs not contagious or bilateral (but you can rarely get chicken pox from someone with shingles.)"
10q6zen,Ugh. I reeeally want the vaccine. I hate being in this age of too old (and already infected) for the chicken pox vax but too young for the shingles vax.
10q6zen,I haven't had any side effects from covid or flu shots at all. I'm turning 49 right before my annual physical. I'm hoping my doctor will let me get it then. Thank you for your comment!
10q6zen,Lol! Side effects from a tic tac. Thanks for the laugh! This thread had me stressing.
10q6zen,I can handle that.
10q6zen,Same
10q6zen,An old backroads one! I‚Äôm having those convos with her right now.
10q6zen,One that is either not up to date on vaccines or a moron. Could also be both.
10q6zen,You can but your insurance won‚Äôt pay for it so expect to pay out of pocket.
10q6zen,"While there are of course exceptions, I, my sister and my dad have all had shingles. Painful? Sure. Agony? No. I got mine on my rib cage and it would hurt when clothing would brush up against it. Used pain-relieving cream, took acyclovir, and it was gone within a week."
10q6zen,Do you have you had the chickenpox vaccine? Because you can still catch chickenpox. It is still out there in the wild.
10q6zen,"Generally, insurance won't cover until you're 50. I was down at the pharmacy on my 50th birthday with my arm out."
10q6zen,"Also. If you‚Äôve never had Chicken Pox, you can‚Äôt get Shingles. Shingles is a remnant of the Chicken Pox virus and therefore if you‚Äôve never had CP you‚Äôll never get Shingles."
10q6zen,"In the US, I think you have to be 50 for it to be covered by insurance, unless you are immune-compromised."
10q6zen,I go for mine in about 20 mins!
10q6zen,"Well, we‚Äôre next day. Arm hurts but not as much as flu or covid. And no other reactions. That‚Äôs one down!"
10q6zen,"I was wondering about that and couldn‚Äôt find anything about it. All the collateral says Shingrix is effective for 5-7 years. So after that, you do it again?"
10q6zen,Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not always horrible but it can be. My husband had it in his 30s and had pain and fatigue but manageable. Another friend has had it twice and it was mostly a painful drag. But I know two other folks who were absolutely laid out and really suffering - and those two aren‚Äôt whiny like me! So‚Ä¶ it depends on a lot of factors. This thread shows it really is awful for some folks and can have long term impacts.
10q6zen,"Hmm. No one told me to wait 5 weeks before getting another vax when I did dose 1 and they gave a 4 month window for dose 2 (2-6 months after dose 1). Pharmacist told me some people react to #1, some to 2, some to both and some to neither. I was quite fluish from first dose for almost 3 days

Edit- I don‚Äôt know if this is best practice but the cdc seems to be saying that shingrix can be given at the same time as other vaccines. This may not have been the case with the previous shingles vax zostavax that is no longer available, because that was a live vaccine (I know an elderly immune compromised person who got shingles from zostavax just before it was taken off the market!) 

Here‚Äôs the CDC comment on shingrix co administration https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/hcp/shingrix/faqs.html"
10q6zen,"Same. I had no issues with either dose of the shingles vax, even though I did the 2nd at the same time as my flu shot. But covid  #2 had me in bed for a day."
10q6zen,"It‚Äôs really wild, I agree!"
10q6zen,Here‚Äôs hoping that it‚Äôs no big deal for you!
10q6zen,Shingrix is the newer vaccine and I believe it‚Äôs the only one offered now. It‚Äôs highly effective
10q6zen,My understanding is that they are only good for 10 years and they dont have a booster yet. Is this new vax supposed to fix that?
10q6zen,"I believe they shouldn't have to worry about it. Shingles is basically what happens when the CP virus ""hides itself"" in your nerve cells after the initial illness and then gets reactivated later, which often happens due to stress or other things that weaken the immune system (including getting older). I imagine there have been exceptions (nothing in medicine is 100%, after all), but that's my understanding of how it works."
10q6zen,"Jeez those kids have it so easy. No chicken pox, that rubbery ground  at playgrounds, streaming tv shows, the works."
10q6zen,"I was never able to get a straight answer on this. A titer showed I had never had CP, so I got the CP vaccine as an adult. I have also gotten the shingles vaccine but I am not sure I needed it."
10q6zen,"I was told that with chicken pox vax my son wouldn‚Äôt get shingles. He‚Äôs still young 24 & no shingles yet. But 2 friends whose kids had vax , both ended up with shingles in late teens. So now i‚Äôm not so sure.  They all had it when they were a yr old & the booster"
10q6zen,"Since it‚Äôs a live vaccine, they can absolutely get shingles later on in life from it. It lives dormant in the body & can come out later as shingles. And it‚Äôs causing a rise in shingles in older people because their bodies aren‚Äôt getting the natural immune boost they used to when they were around kids with chicken pox. (It was similar to a booster for them.)"
10q6zen,"If you had chicken pox, you should definitely get the shingles vaccine.

I think -- but I'm not a doctor so you should double-check with your doctor -- that, if you had the CP vaccine, you wouldn't also need the shingles vaccine."
10q6zen,"It does affect the eyes. My grandmother lost her eye due to shingles. 

Think I‚Äôm about ready to get a vaccine!"
10q6zen,Thanks for the advice
10q6zen,Yikes!!!
10q6zen,"My doctor tested me.  It was definitely shingles.  He was surprised I‚Äôd gotten it so young.  I gave CP to all 3 of my family members.  Shingles definitely can give someone CP, if they haven‚Äôt had it before."
10q6zen,Shingles can cause chicken pox. Chicken pox is dangerous for adults.
10q6zen,You can give people chicken pox who haven't  had it. It's the same virus resurfacing. And although shingles is usually on one side of the body it can occur in multiple dermatomes so could be on both sides or a larger area on one side.
10q6zen,It doesn't always work that way- I've known a few people who have had it on both sides of their bodies.
10q6zen,Yep. Had it three times as a young adult. Even though I was vac
10q6zen,"I think I need to get this test people are saying will identify if you received the vaccine ‚Äî or check if it‚Äôs ok to get vaccinated twice and get the shot. 

I really don‚Äôt think I got the vaccine but my memory since menopause has become so untrustworthy. lol / üôÑ I would have been a year out of college in 1995, which is when it came out according to another poster. I recall more than one hiv test back then and treatment for really bad neglected strep throat in 1996, but I sure don‚Äôt recall getting a chicken pox vaccination. 

Thanks for responding. üôÇ"
10q6zen,I will be too then!
10q6zen,Thank you! I actually am immune-compromised thanks to the medicine I take for my MS. That‚Äôs what makes me worry about getting shingles. I am going to look into getting the vax in the near future. Thanks for posting this!
10q6zen,"Good luck! It hurt a bit going in, and my arm is sore, but it wasn't terrible. It knocked me off my butt today though....I've been sleeping all afternoon. Hope you can rest up!"
10q6zen,Dammit! I spoke too soon and jinxed myself. Starting to feel crappy. Not dying but enough to make me just want to lie around.
10q6zen,I wish this stuff was more clear. Sounds like the 2 shots and set for the rest our life. In 5 years time they will change their mind again I‚Äôm sure and suggest we all get a booster.
10q6zen,My impression is that there is not clear data or policy beyond 7 years
10q6zen,Interesting. Our pharmacist told us about the 5 weeks wait when we were getting out first shot. We didn‚Äôt know this before booking the vaccine.
10q6zen,This is great news!  Thanks for the update. I remember a while back everybody wanted the newer vaccine and it was challenging to find it sometimes.
10q6zen,"I saw this on the GenX subreddit as well but no one could provide a source.  Even the vaccine websites don‚Äôt say this.  Not sure where the rumour is coming from, but if you have a source, I‚Äôd be grateful because I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs true.

I had the Shinrix.  Knocked me on my ass, both shots, but just for a day.  So many people are getting shingles, younger and younger, and as it can be brought on by stress I figured it was time for me to get it done.  I‚Äôm early 50s and it was strongly recommended by my doc and our pharmacist.  No one mentioned not being able to get a booster or another round down the road.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
10q6zen,"Wait, I thought having had chicken pox was what made you susceptible to shingles? So what you said about how the virus that causes chicken pox is in your system and gets reactivated (but then it‚Äôs called shingles)‚Äî yes, that is my understanding. 

Maybe you mean if you haven‚Äôt had chicken pox and then get the chicken pox vaccine, then you shouldn‚Äôt get chicken pox or shingles. 

Lol. I need to re-investigate this."
10q6zen,"That being said, even if you did get the CP vaccine, I'd still ask the doctor about getting the shingles vaccine if you're 50 or older. Might as well do everything you can to prevent getting shingles, because it super-sucks."
10q6zen,"That's super scary. I've never had chicken pox. Keep meaning to get vaxed, since getting it now that I'm in my 40s would probably not go well for me :/"
10q6zen,Shingles is chicken pox - same virus. But the second time around it attacks nerves. Not transmissible unless you put fluid from sores directly onto another person who has a) never had chicken pox ad/or b) never been vaccinated against chickenpox.
10q6zen,Unfortunately that‚Äôs what happens when vaccine compliance drops below a certain threshold.
10q6zen,"I'm that person, fwiw. 

The day I turned 18, I started signing my permission slips and handing them back to the school, explaining I was no longer a minor and no longer required parental permission for anything. Apparently, no one had ever thought of that before. Drove them bonkers. 

The night before my 21st birthday, I was standing in front of the cashier waiting for midnight to buy a 12 pack of beer. 12:01 I bought my first beer. :D

So yeah. That was me on my 50th birthday, saying ""vax me, baby!"""
10q6zen,"Arm‚Äôs fine at the moment, but we‚Äôll see. The tech told me I can start taking ibuprofen now and drinking lots of water, to help. And that if it going to get me, it will be tonight/tomorrow. And that it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôll be fine for this one but yucky for the second. Regardless, as everyone before has said, it‚Äôs better than shingles!"
10q6zen,"I had a Dr. tell me they‚Äôre actually hoping it lasts significantly longer than the 7 years they say it will, and they‚Äôre currently working on a booster."
10q6zen,I may not be reading this as carefully as I could but the CDC site says it‚Äôs effective for 7 years. There currently isnt a booster. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html
10q6zen,Kids who have had the CP vaccine as kids are protected from CP and Shingles
10q6zen,Yeah I don't want it! I've got enough problems already.
10q6zen,You can only get shingles if you‚Äôve had chicken pox.
10q6zen,"Yes, transmittable, just like the comment mentioned - passed between spouses."
10q6zen,"That was me with my 18th birthday. I went sky diving, got a piercing and a tattoo."
10q6zen,"Yup, it got me today. I spent all afternoon in bed sleeping,  but I'm OK with that. It's too cold to go anywhere anyway. Ibuprofen works, and you can alternate with Tylenol also. It's definitely preferable to actual shingles. There's no way I have time for that. The thought of going blind or having permanent nerve damage got me running to Walgreens. Take it easy and roll with it."
10q6zen,"I guess my question is, why can‚Äôt you just do the two Shinrix shots again, ten years down the road?  I haven‚Äôt seen it written anywhere that you can‚Äôt just do the series again.  

Thanks for the link.  Yes, the site says it‚Äôs very strong for the first seven years, then May start to wane after that."
10q6zen,Thank you!
10q6zen,Right. My fear is someone with shingles will infect me with chicken pox.
10q6zen,"That isn‚Äôt true. The varicella vaccine reduces your likelihood of getting shingles by like 65% but since it introduces the live virus, it still has potential to cause the shingles later in life."
10q6zen,"You cannot contract shingles from someone who has shingles. You can contract chicken po from them, though."
10q6zen,"Ah.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible but can‚Äôt guarantee it.  I did ask the doctor about shingles being contagious and they said only if you like rubbed an open pox sore into a cut or something.  You‚Äôd really have to try, apparently!"
10q6zen,"Right, sorry, meant to say chicken pox or the CP vaccine.  Good catch.  :)"
10zgcsr,"Oh yeah, baby! I mean- I‚Äôve had thick, coarse hair my entire life, but now that it‚Äôs eighty five percent gray, it‚Äôs about as easy to style as steel wool! I can see why short is the answer for many.  Conversely, there‚Äôs an argument to be made for growing it out long. But there‚Äôs no in between for this hair!"
10zgcsr,"Every post on here is like ‚Äúomg, THATS part of this too?‚Äù Should we‚Ä¶write a book?"
10zgcsr,My straight hair went wavy and curly. The only good thing that has happened so far.
10zgcsr,"Hormones are no joke! I went from stick straight to wavy when my daughter was born 20 years ago. Then got curls and springs when I hit peri. Now I am dry, dry, dry and my hair is this weirdly wispy looking cloud of dullness. 
Have also tried five million products and techniques. I am finally understanding why little old ladies end up with that one haircut."
10zgcsr,"My curl patterns have changed up a bit and the texture is definitely different. 

I don‚Äôt have a ton of gray, but the ones I have I always spot and they rarely cooperate. 

My routine typically consists of a clarifying shampoo. Depending on how much product is in my hair I will use it, use a scalp brush to work it in. Rinse and then repeat with that or another less harsh shampoo. I rinse and then condition. If it‚Äôs really cold and dry, I will rinse with a clarifying shampoo then use cowash, and condition. After conditioning I rinse, and use leave in conditioner on my ends. Not a ton of it, but enough for slip. 

When it‚Äôs wet I use a curl cream to retain moisture and then use mousse for some hold. I have a ton of styling products and will mix it up. I will use gel or texture spray depending on the weather or how my hair is behaving. 

Starting in 2020, I became fixated on styling my curly hair. I invested in a ton of products stopped using a curling iron to combat frizz. It lasted about two years. Now I just want relatively consistent results and I use my curling iron again. I also wash my hair once or twice a week. That helps with it not drying out. I realize not everyone has hair texture that will allow for that. It does however work for me. 

I wish you the best of luck. YouTube has educational videos with women our age and what they use for their hair types and styling needs. I learned a lot during quarantine and my brief obsession with styling my curls."
10zgcsr, My wavy hair went straight. I miss my waves.
10zgcsr,I literally went and got a perm this week.  I went from curly hair to forest hag hair in short order and could not take it any more
10zgcsr,"Me! I tried this today and it worked. I live in a humid climate on the southern east coast, so my hair, which i typically blow out, gets frizzy about 300 days a year. I went to the beach yesterday and the frizz was minimal. I got this all at Walmart:

-Hairitage bonding pre-treatment
-Wash & condition with Aveeno shampoo (green bottle)
-Hairitage Smooth It Over with a argan oil
-Hairitage heat protectant spray
-Blow dry
-Flatiron to style"
10zgcsr,Curly hair person here. I have salt and pepper hair now and those silvers can get a bit wild at times! I use a salon quality purple shampoo once or twice a week followed by a hydrating conditioner. (Only wash my hair once or twice a week). I then use a curl cream (Morrocan oil curl cream) on the wet hair followed by mousse (Bioloage hydrating foam). This routine keeps my curls looking pretty good.
10zgcsr,"Have you considered a Keratin treatment? It retains curl but defeats frizz. I get one every few months and my frizzy, cowlicky, wavy hair is smooth and silky every day. You'll spend some money but it's really worth it!

If you get one, be sure to ask your stylist about what shampoos to use. Regular shampoo will zap it right out of your hair, you have to go sulfate-free.

edited to add: The treatment is for all kinds of hair and ethnicity."
10zgcsr,Have your thyroid checked. My normally curly hair turned into brittle straw because my TSH levels were really high.
10zgcsr,My bone straight hair went curly!  It's a learning process for all of us it seems!
10zgcsr,"I stopped using shampoo and only use conditioner. Game changer. 
I will occasionally will use a gray shampoo to keep the grey shiny."
10zgcsr,"Mine has started to be frizzy curls to, it's horrible.  üò•ü§£ the shit we have to deal with! Have you tried Moroccan oil? The brand name is Moroccan oil and it's like a teal blue or Tiff blue logo sticker on an amber colored bottle. Their products are the best thing I've found to help/heal our curl's"
10zgcsr,"Mine is frizzy, wirey, and smelly.  I used to have really nice hair. I can't stand to even touch it. I just keep it in a bun away from me."
10zgcsr,"I have always had long straight hair. One day I woke up and WTF is that frizz ball only in the front. It looked like a deranged mullet, party in the back, chaos up front. After numerous expensive products that didn't work I tried this old trick. Wash and condition hair as normal. After rinsing out conditioner, take a small amount of conditioner in your palms and run it through your hair. Do not rinse out. Dry and style as normal. It works, believe it or not."
10zgcsr,Mine just all fell out üòû
10zgcsr,"Olaplex bond repair treatments once a week, whatever washout conditioner your hair will accept every day, shampoo every other day at most, and then another leave in conditioner when all is said and done. Then let air dry.  This is the only routine my hair stands a chance with at this point, and even that is hit or miss üôÉ

Good luck!"
10zgcsr,"My hair is naturally thick/coarse, a daily challenge.   I started using Color Wow dream coat and sometimes their leave in conditioner, it haas definitely made a difference.  It cuts down the frizz and smooths . They have another product you can put in for 2nd day hair that smooths it out if you need it.  It's been working for about 6 months, so I'm crossing my fingers!"
10zgcsr,"Mine went from fairly straight to POOF!
Only good thing is that I‚Äôve always had oily skin and hair, and now it‚Äôs average."
10zgcsr,"Mine is turning more grey, it‚Äôs stiff and doesn‚Äôt get smooth after washing any more. I‚Äôm about to get it all chopped off today lol can‚Äôt stand it."
10zgcsr,Started using K18 1/week and it restored my curls.
10zgcsr,"Yes. It's a wiry nightmare now, up in a ponytail 99% of the time. Frizz surrounding my face -what's with this wispy crap I can't tuck in or do anything with? Ugh."
10zgcsr,"Mine was already pretty frizzy, but now if I grow it out more than about an inch it starts matting at the nape of my neck, like several times a day no matter what I do. üòñ It's really fortunate that a buzz cut/faux-hawk suits my personality, but every once in a while I wish I could grow it out and see if I have cool grey-streaked curls!"
10zgcsr,I went into brittle frizz mode
10zgcsr,"My widows peak is getting worse every year. Atleast it has baby hair though. For clarity, that is hair loss on either side of where you would have bangs. Which I have to cover it up lol."
10zgcsr,My hairdresser told me to use dryer sheets to rub down my hair when it was frizzy. Give that a try.
10zgcsr,Yes it is dry like the Sahara‚Ä¶and not any product out there makes it look better :/
10zgcsr,"Mine was 3a/b curly my entire life and now straight and I hate it. Started changing about a year ago. I spent all that time learning to manage the curls, now I have no idea how to manage the flatness."
10zgcsr,"Oh yes.  Mix in high humidity and I look a swamp witch on a good day.  I‚Äôve resorted to using headbands / bandanas to keep it all contained.  Now that it‚Äôs turning white, it as manageable as a Brillo pad.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I use a light balm at the front and then twist my curls into some sort of structure, then use wax once it‚Äôs dry.  It‚Äôs full on isn‚Äôt it?!"
10zgcsr,"My curly hair went more frizzy, but it's the white is more coarse and wiry. I have found putting in a gloss has helped the texture."
10zgcsr,"My hair thinned in the front, I‚Äôm bald enough that I have to do a comb over. My hair is also insanely dry and frizzy and thin.  It‚Äôs awful. üòû"
10zgcsr,Davines Love conditioner.  Miracle product for my curls
10zgcsr,"I used to have lovely waves ‚Ä¶no more. 

Nothing works anymore."
10zgcsr,"Straight as a board and **THICK** now; thin, fine, randomly curly with frizz!!!!!!!!"
10zgcsr,Mine went from pin straight to fairly curly in my 40s.
10zgcsr,"Mine's the opposite. My hair was thicker and always frizzed in the humidity. I would get keratin treatments to keep it in line once or twice a year. I'm still in perimenopause and in the last year, it's gotten much finer and it barely frizzes. Sometimes I'm happy about this but mostly I miss the thick hair!"
10zgcsr,"I have what I describe as ""unfortunate hair."" I'm a Wite-Out-pale Ashkenazi Jew -- a redhead with hair smooth and shiny like Golda Meir's. Ugh. My girlfriends who are black have been my savior. I wear a satin bonnet to sleep in like they do -- helps keep hair from being dry and frizzy and awful (pillow does that). And I use black hair products. I also use lots of silicone products (Garnier are cheapest) and leave in conditioner that you're supposed to wash out."
10zgcsr,"YES!!!!!! The texture of my hair completely changed
into a coarse, wiry mess. I thought I was somehow damaging my hair over & over because I didn't know I had stumbled into this hellish landscape. I wound up getting extensions to hide as much as I could. 
Something that has helped me tremendously is keratin treatments. The kind a professional does. Not just using keratin products and not the express version. The results are supposed to last ~6 months but I only get a solid 4 months out of them. They are expensive but, in my experience, absolutely worth every single penny. Especially if you live in an area with ultra high humidity. 5 out of 5."
10zgcsr,Mine went from thick oily slightly wavy hair to dry thinner frizzy hair.
10zgcsr,"Yeppers!  I had to change my routine to the following and it works so well!  Shampoo and condition, turkish towel to remove moisture, comb through spray-in conditioner, mousse, gel, let air dry, scrunch out the crunch....and voila - defined curls with almost no frizz.  I have colour treated hair and I'm 51.  On HRT."
10zgcsr,Mine went from textured/wavy to curly. Then from there to straight and won‚Äôt even hold a curl at all now.
10zgcsr,Same. I‚Äôve tried so many products.
10zgcsr,John Frieda Gloss is a wash-in sealer that washes out after 3 washes. Saved me when I had a ‚Äòfrizz halo‚Äô
10zgcsr,What has helped me was using olaplex 3. Really helps some of the frizz! I also use a cream (no lather)shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Both these things have helped a lot but my hair is definitely not as flexible or manageable. I have more frizz than before and it tangles easily which I have never had a problem with.
10zgcsr,"BTZ Heat Protectant spray (not the cream). Sally Beauty has this. Spray this lightly on wet hair whether or not you use heat. This is the best. It keeps my hair soft, shiny, and frizz free."
10zgcsr,"Yup. One day it was curly and the next almost stick straight. I had 3a/b and no matter what I do, nothing has brought them back. I do my best to keep it as hydrated as possible but that‚Äôs it."
10zgcsr,"I'm right there with you.  I can only wash now every 3 days.  I use Loreal Everpure moisturizing shampoo & the 8 Second Wonder Water.  Veering from this in any way makes me into a total frizz head.   Deep, deep sighs..."
10zgcsr,My wavy hair has definately gotten curlier. And I hear you on the frizz. Im just learning to live w it
10zgcsr,"Conditioner only, squish to condish- the curly girl method helps. Mine still has turned to straw for the most part."
10zgcsr,"I went from somewhat wavy to curly! Except for one damn section that went stick straight, grrr. I shampoo 2 or 3 times per week, sulfate and para Ben free and always check ingredients for alcohol. So many frizz tamers contain alcohol and it makes me frizz up even more!"
10zgcsr,"I went from somewhat wavy to curly! Except for one damn section that went stick straight, grrr. I shampoo 2 or 3 times per week, sulfate and para Ben free and always check ingredients for alcohol. So many frizz tamers contain alcohol and it makes me frizz up even more!"

10zgcsr,"My previously pin-straight hair with a donkey butt (that‚Äôs what my MIL called it‚Äî I used to have just one big bump in the back of my hair that nobody could figure out üòÇ), has gone seriously wavy, and if I put the right product in it will curl! 

One of the few upsides of this transition that I‚Äôve found so far!"
10zgcsr,"Yes! My hair was very curly when I was young, after my son was born it was less, after my second son, less. Now in menopause it‚Äôs just really frizzy, wavy and there is some curl underneath. It always looks bad, nothing works on it anymore. I just do braids now, French/Dutch etc. I have to do them wet and use gel to keep the hair from frizzing out of the braids. It‚Äôs also thinning along my hairline, which is another benefit /s."
10zgcsr,I skip conditioner and use liquid coconut oil. Works like a champ to beat frizz!
10zgcsr,"Color WOW dream coat anti frizz treatment really works. The only turn off about this product is the large quantity you have to use to see results but like the name-wow, it really works."
10zgcsr,I had super straight hair as a kid.  It got a little wavy in puberty. And now it's just a massive frizz ball and I hate it!
10zgcsr,"No, I have curly hair. But I don't destroy it by stripping it with shampoo, which is really bad for your hair. Go to the NoPoo sub and learn about what you can do. 

I haven't used shampoo in about 20 years and my hair is so much nicer for it. For a long time I cowashed with conditioner, VO 5 is paraben and sulfate free and I get it from the dollar store. More recently I have been using aloe vera from my garden (you can get a gallon super cheap at places like Walmart) to clean it with a little conditioner and it is super soft. 

Give it a try. You'll see how much healthier your hair is and save a lot of money."
10zgcsr,My curly hair relaxed into waves and started falling out in handfuls üòæ
10zgcsr,"Bob length, dye it black and slick it back. Power move."
10zgcsr,Mine turned into a frizzy mess and i have barely any grays
10zgcsr,"Yes! I thought I was going crazy with all these symptoms and weird things happening to me and my body. But this group has me feeling more normal, and now that I know what it is I can take some steps to get help!"
10zgcsr,"I'm an applied science syndicated columnist and author, vetting and translating science into everyday language and offering advice based on it. My science-based book on this subject (menopause and perimenopause) will be published in 2024. I've been doing a deep dive into the research since July of 2017."
10zgcsr,Right I was so dumbfounded till I found this community.  My mother taught me nothing about it‚Ä¶but believe me I am totally teaching mine as I learn.
10zgcsr,"I think you've already got a working title, there."
10zgcsr,Same here!!  I love it because I finally have the hair I always wanted!
10zgcsr,"My baby fine, flat hair now has wave and looks fuller. Don't get it or understand it...but I am appreciating it.

Btw, cut mine short because the hot flashes in FL while working in a bakery were killing me. Actually kinda loving my hair right now, quick and easy to wash and style (my current routine....let it air dry). 

I do notice there is a different texture in the back...used to be really silky smooth, and now it's coarser and tangles more easy."
10zgcsr,"This is all really bad for your hair. All of the products are focused on making money, not what is best for your hair.  Read what I wrote above (or below.)"
10zgcsr,"This is also me, except for one wave remaining in an inconvenient spot, like midway neck length. So I need to a) keep my hair really short (chin length), b) straighten the one kink out, or c) attempt to put multiple waves back into my hair. So far I've been going with chin length; enough of my hair is falling out as it is, and I don't want to be heat-treating it every day."
10zgcsr,So did mine!
10zgcsr,"‚Äúforest hag hair‚Äù

That is such a great visual!"
10zgcsr,"Thanks for this. I only wash once or twice a week as well, and I love Moroccan Oil but haven‚Äôt tried their curl cream. I‚Äôll give that and the Bioloage a try."
10zgcsr,Thanks for this.
10zgcsr,"Wow, interesting. My.mom just had her thyroid glands removed because they were enlarged and she said she couldn't believe the difference in the changes it caused to her body. I will have to look into this, thks for the info"
10zgcsr,"My previously pin-straight hair with a donkey butt (that‚Äôs what my MIL called it‚Äî I used to have just one big bump in the back of my hair that nobody could figure out üòÇ), has gone seriously wavy, and if I put the right product in it will curl! 

One of the few upsides of this transition that I‚Äôve found so far!"
10zgcsr,Exactly. It's called cowashing. read what I wrote above (or below.)
10zgcsr,"I love their oil, I‚Äôm going to look for their curl cream."
10zgcsr,"Morocco oil smells terrible in my hair.  Really bad smell. I found grapefruit and mint shampoo and conditioner,  to cut the oil smell"
10zgcsr,That really sucks! I see this in a lot of women and its just another horrible side effect of being an aging woman!ü§£
10zgcsr,"Are you a stylist by any chance? I went to a new one a while back and she used Olaplex, and it ruined my hair. üò© For months afterward when I washed it, it would get all bunched up like a squirrels nest in knots. It was awful to try and brush out.

I wonder if there‚Äôs anything with a similar purpose but works for people who didn‚Äôt have luck with Olaplex‚Ä¶?"
10zgcsr,"I use Olaplex and it does help a little, but I can not let my hair air dry or it looks like tumble weed.  Most inconvenient thing in my life right now. lol."
10zgcsr,"Mine went from super straight to straight-but-frizzy, only it turns out that straight-but-frizzy = wavy! So now that I‚Äôve learned how to manage it, I actually have pretty nice wavy hair for the first time in my life."
10zgcsr,I had never heard of this. I‚Äôm going to give it a try.
10zgcsr,It is! Full on bullshit.
10zgcsr,I‚Äôm sorry. This crap sucks.
10zgcsr,"Thank you for this. I do have a bonnet, but I‚Äôll look into the other products as well."
10zgcsr,Thank you! I‚Äôll look into this.
10zgcsr,It‚Äôs so frustrating! There has to be some product t out there to take the frizz
10zgcsr,"Thank you, making a note of this."
10zgcsr,"Yes, the tangles are brutal. I have an olaplex poo & conditioner, I‚Äôll have to check the number"
10zgcsr,I have deva Curl no-poo. That was the first thing I tried when the frizz began but so far not helping much. I also never use shampoos with sulfates because my bestie is my hair person and she won‚Äôt let me haha
10zgcsr,"But everyone is so different. Mum said she thought she has one hot flash. She was always very regular and periods were never a surprise or a nuisance. She was pregnant at least eight times. She figured I would skate through menopause like she did and never talked about it. I had horrible periods which were highly erratic. I was never pregnant. I had perimenopause for a long time, with all kinds of symptoms, finally got a hysterectomy, and then had problems finding any kind of HRT that worked. How could she have taught me that?"
10zgcsr,"Me, three!!"
10zgcsr,It works for me. Glad your method has been beneficial for you. Everyone‚Äôs needs vary. I have found a routine I like and doesn‚Äôt destroy my hair.
10zgcsr,Being a forest hag is my life goal‚Ä¶I just want to be incognito about it.  Can‚Äôt be running around exposing myself like that
10zgcsr,"As your mom‚Äôs had her thyroid removed, I would hope the doctors put her on thyroid medication. Without it, she will indeed likely experience a lot of changes like hair loss, cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, changes to her menstrual cycle etc etc."
10zgcsr,They have a curl gel that's called diva curl and it's  the best  you only need a little bit. They also have a spray in for touch up that's real good.
10zgcsr,"Really? It smells amazing in my hair and works really well. That stinks then literally, I know other brands of Moroccan oil smell horrible, some of the diva (Moroccan oil) products like the spray gel and any of their non organic products they carry I don't use, just the natural oil. It heals my hair alot and works wonders. Of course now going into menopause my hair is not cooperating always. Ugh. I think it either works for you or doesn't from what ive heard from others that have used it. 

 I love this mint and eucalyptus shampoo and conditioner my hairdresser got me, its also great for body wash, helps with stress, headaches to. Alot of his clients use Kendra I think, not sure if you've tried that. I also use a deep conditioner that I absolutely love and smells amazing, it's called 21 pure fanatic deep conditioner from pureology along with the 21 leave in spray conditioner. It works amazing on my frizz, I also use their other products, depending on your hair type color etc."
10zgcsr,Mines falling out too :-(
10zgcsr,"Olaplex did not work for me at all, either."
10zgcsr,"Do you recall which Olaplex product the stylist used? Some of them contain silicone, which some hair really doesn‚Äôt like. The Olaplex #3 is the bond repair (no silicone), which works wonders for my naturally curly (and now mostly grey) hair.
Edited for clarity on the product."
10zgcsr,"I got the super expensive Olaplex 3 and used it religiously and it didn't do anything at all! In fact it made my hair feel so weird when I was washing it out in the shower, like fake doll hair? I recently bought a $3 hair protein mask at the grocery store and it made my hair so smooth, I'm sticking with that for now."
10zgcsr,"No, not a stylist but I learned about it from mine. It might have to did something with hair types?  I have naturally corse hair, so she needs some extra help üòÜ"
10zgcsr,"Happy to hear it's helpful! I also use a diffuser and scrunching products to define my curls and then I hairspray them so they don't just fan out into a ball of frizz. 

Products I find helpful: Argan oil, Shea Moisture (shea butter hibiscus) Curl Enhancing Smoothie, Cantu coconut curling cream, and Garnier silicone products. I also use L'Oreal Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture leave-in conditioner. I wash only a bit of it out. 

Here's to your curls! -Amy"
10zgcsr,That's great. I don't know that brand. I basically use what is in the kitchen or yard. Try aloe vera.
10zgcsr,"I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs a science to it but I could at least hear some warning signs.  Me and my mother are two peas in the pod‚Ä¶periods regular, both had kids, both got periods super early in age‚Ä¶some kinda hint would have been nice.  Like hey‚Ä¶period starts getting a little wonky, your hairs as dry as your vagina‚Ä¶might be something going on with the menopause‚Ä¶just a little heads up! My mother never was like that though.  She barely taught me about my periods.  I had to figure life out‚Ä¶"
10zgcsr,Me four!
10zgcsr,"Agree. I have 3c curly hair and tried cowashing. Hard no. It doesn‚Äôt clean the scalp properly. I use a moisturizing gentle shampoo, conditioner, leave in and 1-2x per month a deep conditioner. I‚Äôm too lazy but also satin pillowcase or head wrap while sleeping, inside of toques etc as cotton pulls moisture from hair."
10zgcsr,"I‚Äôve tried that, unfortunately doesn‚Äôt work for me."
10zgcsr,I just read an article from good rx claiming OPALEX is under a lawsuit due to damaging hair and people losing their hair. I think it was #3. You might want to check it out.
10zgcsr,"I don‚Äôt remember. 

At first I thought it was just a bad cut but then realized that wouldn‚Äôt probably make sense with wet hair‚Ä¶? ü§î So I assumed the Olaplex; and it cost me a lot of money to try it so I was mad at myself! üòÜ"
10zgcsr,"Yes! Fake doll hair, what a good description! 

For me it was like that too- it felt awful (dry like straw, almost) in the shower (how‚Äôs that even possible?!) and would bunch in places as I washed it‚Ä¶ I describe it as developing a ‚Äúsquirrel nest‚Äù- it would mat and knot, and was terrible to try and brush out after (even with a detangling brush and spray & leave-in conditioner). Even after leaving that stylist and having the Olaplex treatment, my hair hasn‚Äôt completely gone back to normal‚Äî it‚Äôs been two years! I‚Äôm not sure what other people pay to have it done, but they added $75 to my bill for the treatment (that I wish I could get back!).

Would you mind sharing the brand of mask you got at the market? I‚Äôd like to try one!"
10zgcsr,"Ahh, maybe. My hair used to be pin straight. 

It‚Äôs gotten really wavy (curly if I put the right product in) during peri and haven‚Äôt tried it since."
10zgcsr,"I was sleeping with hair bonnets and they just would fall off. I‚Äôm lazy too and haven‚Äôt invested in a satin pillow case. After two years of being hyper focused on my hair, I kind of don‚Äôt care anymore. I want easy."
10zgcsr,"Oh yea some work and some don't, I have tried so so many products I could prob start up a store with all the products Ive bought and don't use."
10zgcsr,"Well damn, I didn‚Äôt know about that. Thanks for the heads up!

https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/olaplex-hair-products-lawuit-balding-blisters/"
10zgcsr,"That‚Äôs a shame, because yes, they are not cheap."
10zgcsr,"Me too. I just don‚Äôt have the patience so I do all the other stuff. Also, I do a scalp scrub with brown sugar,
Olive oil or coconut oil and peppermint essential oil. Heaven."
10zgcsr,"I wanna know how most women keep the bonnets on through the night, coz I cannot. I've had to stop sleeping with my dreads untied coz of walking up tangled around my neck sometimes... ! So now I gather then on a high top bun and call it a night. My twists don't last long though alas."

10zgcsr,I have an adjustable one and luckily for me it stays in place. Not sure how I manage that.
10upf93,"I bounce between cravings like crazy but they mostly stick in the sugary or salty categories.  Last week I went to BJs and bought a box of full size chocolate bars.   This week it‚Äôs a jar of pickles, last week it was milkshakes.  It‚Äôs crazy but unfortunately the cravings help keep me sane."
10upf93,"Yes. I‚Äôve always been a sugar fiend, but the hormone-initiated drive to eat sugar is INTENSE! You aren‚Äôt crazy. I don‚Äôt have an answer, either! ü§£"
10upf93,Ugh! So sorry you're living with the nasty effects of surgical menopause. I know all too well how miserable that feels! I'm a sweets lover...always have been. But I lost my appetite for almost everything post-op so it wasn't much of a problem. My appetite did return but not to the pre-op level. I would probably overdo the sweets if they were readily available.
10upf93,"Try not to start eating it. Otherwise, you may want more & more"
10upf93,"Yeah, food craving go crazy with menopause.   But so does weight gain.  It‚Äôs a good time to both eat better and exercise more or it‚Äôs easy to gain a lot of weight that will be very very difficult to lose. 

I recommend really trying to eat enough protein, and eat something healthy before you eat something sweet.  I do this and often once I have eaten some protein and vegetables I‚Äôm not still hungry but if I still want a sweet thing I‚Äôll have a tiny bit."
10upf93,"This is insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone, too. If you are an apple shape or have more fat on your torso than hips/thighs, you are insulin resistant. Since your cells are resistant to insulin, which is what carries glucose into the cells to be used as energy, your body will crave more glucose because it isn't getting into the cells.

The only way to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin resistance is to stop feeding it glucose, i.e. carbs. No one likes to hear it, but it's all we got. It's not a diet, it's a cure for a disease that will kill you eventually as it is the cause of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, strokes, kidney disease, fatty liver disease, and many if not all autoimmune diseases."
10upf93,It's like being pregnant. I ate lays plain potato chips for 2 weeks. Now all I want is sugar. I think I would eat it out of the bag if I'd let myself.
10upf93,"I get it. I've been trying to stop eating refined sugars that I KNOW are bad for me. I am all boobs and belly, so yeah, I need to pay more careful attention to my diet. I am starting a workout plan on Monday so that I can implement that as well. I already have a family history of diabetes and I have a genetic disorder that basically wrecks my body daily. I'm cranky without the sugar, but I guess that's part of beating the addiction. 

I'm just frustrated. I already can't tolerate gluten. Dairy is starting to be a problem if I eat a lot of it. I'm already down to meat, veggies, and fruit for the most part."
10upf93,"There is a lot of new research showing that it‚Äôs not a willpower thing or a moral failure. It‚Äôs a disease process due to genetics & the processed foods we‚Äôve been fed since childhood. You can‚Äôt just cut calories, your body, and my body, won‚Äôt let you.

Trust me, I‚Äôm not judging at all. I deal with this too. It‚Äôs the hardest thing to do, but it‚Äôs the only thing that works. The new GLP1 drugs may work, but for me there isn‚Äôt enough data on long term use & it seems you do have to take for the rest of your life."
10w3nwu,"In order to receive SSDI Disability, you have to be unable to work any job, not just your job. So if they deem you can flip burgers or carry boxes and stick them on a UPS truck, stock shelves at a grocery store etc, you will be denied. Also the Disability has to be expected to be permanent or very long term.

If you have short term disability at work it may get you some weeks off. (temporary problem/symptoms expected to improve)"
10w3nwu,"I wanted to my my docs said that it‚Äôs highly unlikely to receive it. My situation is that I left (quit) a high paying/high stress job in Oct 2022 that exacerbated my peri symptoms. Now, I am close to one of two options (hybrid - part in office, part WFH - commission based insurance business owner) or a nonprofit job requiring unpaid relocation (and, would qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness). If I had the energy I would try to apply for a handful of other WFH jobs. I am no longer miserable since realizing I cannot work the way I used to (or function at all the way I used to), but, this has been scary and is scary going through this alone without truly understanding supporters.

Edit - addition: my docs did offer to write letters of support as they did for the FMLA 6 week leave I took when last employed in Oct 2021 where I established treatment with them."
10w3nwu,"Very, very difficult to get approved.  I hope you feel better soon."
10w3nwu,"Just an fyi a lot of brain fog in peri can be indistinguishable from ADHD.  

Having both is super and the reason I'd like to jump off a roof at the moment :)"
10w3nwu,"Hi,

I work for an insurance company that handles short term and long term disability - also FMLA( family medical leave act).

If your employer suggested it, that probably means that you or she is paying for a policy- take advantage of it. This is different from SSDI- it's an insurance policy that you have through your employer.

As long as you have a doc who will fill out the forms, you can take up to around 12 weeks of continuous disability and collect a percentage (60-80 specific to your employer) of your income.
.
Also, look into FMLA. It doesn't pay you, but you can take time intermittently and your employer must excuse the absences.

Hope this kind of helps! Currently at work, so rushed ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∑‚ù§Ô∏è

10w3nwu,"I had to go part time because I couldn‚Äôt handle the job anymore. I had made my way up and even got my own office, but I crashed and am back down again üòû. Lost my office, my PTO, holiday pay, etc."
10y7y08,"Also in surgical menopause (at age 49). I was a mess on the patch. I thought about trying Estratest / Covaryx but read that the estrogen usually isn't enough for surgical menopause. But you don't know until you try. I assume there are still two strengths, HS (half strength) and FS (full strength). 

I hope you can get settled on something to make you feel more normal. I know it can be tough."
10y7y08,"I understand the lack of energy big time. I am waiting to get help from a new doctor next week. Been dragging without help for 10 years I am now formerly athletic.

On the boob front, (pun unintended sort of) see the subreddit r/abrathatfits"
10y7y08,"If fatigue and lack of energy are the only symptoms not improved by your estradiol patch, then I'd consider adding in a low-dose testosterone.  (I'm assuming you've had your iron levels checked).  

Personally, I would be a bit concerned about going from straight up estradiol in a patch to a very synthetic product (esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone)."
10y7y08,"Yeah, I guess I‚Äôll give it a try, even though I hate the idea of the pill. Read tons of great reviews from women who have been on it for over a decade. Idk. Like I said, I love my patch and have felt great on it until recently when I started hitting the gym hard. And my stupid boobs won‚Äôt stop hurting and being swollen. üôÑ

10y7y08,I‚Äôm with you @leftylibra. I‚Äôm going to test this and see if it truly was testosterone and then maybe see if there is any way i can do testosterone gel. I fought tooth and nail to even get this so I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm torn between the two.
10y7y08,"You are asking all the right questions, trust your gut and demand more!"
10y7y08,"Sent her a msg. I‚Äôm not taking this pill. Been reading about it all night and honestly, a hard pass."
10r8ibw,Yeah. Too little too late for me. I'm angry.
10r8ibw,"Yes and let‚Äôs not forget that the population that was studied in the WHI study were older, average age being 65,when they started HRT, well beyond the 10 year window of perimenopause/ menopause when it is actually recommended to start HRT. The HRT that was used was oral estrogen and synthetic progestin not body-identical progesterone. The study had an arm of the group that only took the estrogen and their rate of breast cancer was actually lower than the women not on HRT. There is a theory now that it was actually the synthetic progestin that caused the health issues. And from my understanding listening to a few different podcast discussing the study, the cohort of women in the study had quite a few co-morbidities to begin with like being smokers, drinking alcohol, and being overweight, which all increase the risk of breast cancer and heart disease on their own."
10r8ibw,"Right?! The stat was only one of the many eye openers for me. A faulty study, inaccurately represented, and decades of misinformation."
1130hqp,"Not sure how old you are but I turn 40 this month and have been experiencing the same symptoms and I have no history of pelvic trauma. What I will say is that prior to having Covid I had an occasional night sweat and some anxiety around periods but after Covid it was like a light switch and I started having night sweats multiple times a month, my periods were insane and I had severe anxiety, depression, rage, etc. my gynecologist blew off the possibility of perimenopause and put me on Lexapro which is helping with the symptoms but I‚Äôm still having weird things happening like super sore breasts and nipples (never had that before) change in sex drive, waking up every night at the same time and unable to get back to sleep. I went to my regular doctor and she said the same thing and said changes in hormones wouldn‚Äôt be detectable if it was peri. I have an appointment with a hormone specialist Gynecologist next month and I‚Äôm hoping to start HRT as I am convinced Covid pushed me into full blown menopause. Maybe yours could also be a side effect of Covid?"
1130hqp,Both covid and the vaccine can cause hormonal issues.  But more so the latter. It's pretty hard on women.
1130hqp,[deleted]
1130hqp,"Get your thyroid checked, as this mimics symptoms of perimenopause."
1130hqp,"It sounds very plausible to me that damage to the pelvis could cause this if somehow it reduced the amount of eggs or caused the reproductive system to not produce hormones normally etc.. But you do need a real diagnosis from a doctor not just speculation.  And some people get premature menopause even with no pelvic trauma, it's quite rare in one's 20s but it happens."
1130hqp,"Not sure if the trauma would do that and since we don‚Äôt know age‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.As said before all thyroid conditions share 75% of symptoms with perimenopause.   My endocrinologist has to help me regulate my supplements, estrogen right now, as the last GYN I saw sent me back to him with no it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs could be thyroid crap."
1130hqp,"This is an interesting take. I‚Äôm 28 now. My symptoms started in 2020 but I didn‚Äôt get Covid until 2022. I‚Äôve been tracking symptoms and cycles religiously. It was thought to be my thyroid, my adrenals, my diet, etc. It‚Äôs been going into my 4th year dealing with this and I‚Äôm just at my wits end üò£"
1130hqp,"My thyroid levels are in range according to the endocrinologist, my PCP and Gyno"
1130hqp,"They were 17, 11 years ago, so they're 28. Not sure if that helps."
112zwpc,"My hands will suddenly let go of or throw what's in my hand. I lost a hand-made pottery coffee cup gifted to me a dozen years ago to this abomination, mildly burning my hand because I had just refilled it, and a few days ago, while attempting to move my cat's food off the table, my whole body suddenly turned and the bowl flew out of my hand splattering the cat food all over my back door, and the rug in front of it. 

Also have this problem with my legs, one will suddenly kick out towards items like door jams and table legs. During a dice game last weekend, my leg suddenly moved in such a way that it smashed my knee against the table leg...so painful I nearly cried a little! 

I've inherited my mother's clumsy genes so I've always struggled with things like tripping over my own feet, but this is not that. 

The reality that my brain can, all on its own, without my consent, just let go of/throw things I'm holding, or cause me to smash my elbows or knees against things I'm near is ridiculous! 

My husband says when I describe it, that it sounds like the physical ticks of turrets, just without the verbal part. Although I almost always follow it with a barrage of colorful verbal expressions! Lol  

20 years of peri and counting and I'm so DONE!"
112zwpc,I just dropped pills all over the bathroom floor for no reason!
112zwpc,"I was going to start a post about this recently, so I'm glad you did first!

It's awful.  I used to have excellent dexterity and fine motor skills.  It started about a year or so ago with texting/typing on my phone.  Having to retype words 5 times.  Giving up and letting autocorrect do what it wants because I'm tired of fighting it.  

Then it was jewelry.  When did it become so difficult to put a necklace on?  I'm going to have to change to long pullover necklaces if it gets any worse.

This week, it's just randomly throwing/dropping pills on the floor.  I take one at a time, and of course it's always the oily supplements that land on the dog-hair covered rug!

A few weeks ago, I went to set my coffee on the table and just missed entirely and dropped my favorite mug on the floor.

My husband has always been like this, and I'm pretty sure it makes him very happy to not be the only one anymore.

Guess I'm just a feeble old woman now.  I don't know if I should even use step stools anymore.  What if I just fall off?  Sigh...."
112zwpc,"I‚Äôve been dropping things like crazy, too.  I used to have bouts of clumsiness in the week prior to my period.  (More than once, dropped jars of pickles in the grocery store pre-period).  I told my husband the other day that I felt like that phenomenon had returned, but my I haven‚Äôt had regular periods the last two years.  I even joked that maybe it was the week before I should‚Äôve had a period.   (After I dropped my morning super size fountain Diet Coke in the parking lot at work having only one sip & later in the day flung a giant package of spring mix across my kitchen like confetti).   This is a wild ride, y‚Äôall."
112zwpc,"Same, I just read the other day that this is common in peri and menopause.    I walk into walls now too!!"
112zwpc,This happened to me and it turned out I was developing a cataract. I had surgery to fix it. My eye doctor was astounded because I was quite young for a cataract. Three years later I had one in the other eye.
112zwpc,"I am steadily getting used it but it was hard at first ‚Äî I‚Äôve had to slow down. Now I know why older people are often slower and more deliberate. It started mostly from an emotional place, I was having anxiety attacks. Now it‚Äôs also from an afraid I‚Äôm going to trip and mess myself up for life place."
112zwpc,"Same here. The other day I dropped cherry tomatoes all over the kitchen floor. And over the weekend while cleaning leaves out of the pool I dropped the net, handle and all in the pool and I had to fish it out with a rake. I‚Äôm constantly complaining that my hands don‚Äôt work anymore. It‚Äôs so frustrating."
112zwpc,"I have dropped more shit in the past year than I have in the previous 49 combined. I was just thinking the other day I need an exorcism because I‚Äôve been invaded with the dropsies.  

I also used to be super sure on my feet and rarely fell. Now, I wouldn‚Äôt pass a field sobriety test stone cold sober because my balance has gone to hell in a hand basket. 

Thanks, meno, appreciate you‚Ä¶NOT."
112zwpc,"This happens to me when I need to eat. No nerve or grip issues, I just drop things."
112zwpc,"I cannot even tell you the number of glasses, jars, dishes, mugs, bowls, serving dishes I dropped or slammed into the counter/cabinet/microwave/dishwasher/stove/oven!!! Took a while but it eventually gets better."
112zwpc,Definitely relate! I have arthritis in my hands now and my grip isn‚Äôt like it was. Also wearing multi focal glasses now sometimes I misjudge distances. Plus I can‚Äôt remember things the way I used to. That part bugs me the most.
112zwpc,"I keep tripping. I could walk through the house and I swear that my foot seeks out the nearest table leg or chair leg. Just yesterday, I came out of my new GP checkup and tripped right over the scale in the hallway, that was just on!!

I fell three times last year. It really shook my confidence.  I have been a ballroom dancer, but I am afraid of my balance now. What the hell?"
112zwpc,"I‚Äôm the same since peri not been a clumsy person.
It‚Äôs like things just fly out of my hand.I also have either completely broken or chipped crockery by not judging distance of tap or cupboard.My latest catastrophe was I put my air fryer on top of my oven hob whilst also using the hob next to it well it melted the bottom of the bloody air fryer!! WTF was I thinking.I also cannot seem to fit through doors anymore as I often manage to just walk into the door surround.I often burn myself whilst cooking & cut myself honestly I‚Äôm becoming a liability I hope it doesn‚Äôt last."
112zwpc,Omg 20 yrs of peri! I can't imagine this hell.
112zwpc,"Honestly, I've been like this all my life. If there's a way to drop it, spill it, break it or fall over it I'll find a way."
112zwpc,"I‚Äôve noticed this when I‚Äôm extra tired (because honestly, I‚Äôm tired ALL THE FREAKING TIME) or when I‚Äôve been doing repetitive things. For example I volunteer at a food shelf and when I‚Äôm bagging food for a couple of hours and tie the bags shut by the end of the shift my hands are fumbling more to grab containers. I recently dropped an egg carton. Oof."
112zwpc,"I‚Äôve always had poor depth perception and special awareness, but I was definitely dropping things way more often for a couple months last year. I haven‚Äôt noticed it as much lately. Fortunately it hasn‚Äôt been anything breakable."
112zwpc,"I'm clumsy as all hell! But yes the clumsy has gotten much worse lately.  I was holding a paver in my hands walking to the  spot it should go and I just opened my hands and dropped it right there, then I hopped like a retarded bunny so it wouldn't smash my toes (after it had landed) and yelled a full 5 seconds after it happened."
112zwpc,I go through phases where I drop and spill things too. But it passes. Is that the weirdest thing?!? It‚Äôs like the hand eye coordination is off. I also had vestibular neuritis a couple years ago. One time event that landed me in the ER. Frightening. It‚Äôs so fun going through menopause!
112zwpc,"In the last week I have smashed a cup (why is it always the best one?) and thrown a cup of coffee over the stair carpet with no idea how that happened, always bumping into doors and walls, so heavy handed that it sounds like I am constantly throwing stuff, I‚Äôve always been a bit clumsy but this is off the scale"
112zwpc,I have been dropping everything lately!  Had no idea it is related to the Big M
112zwpc,"Everything is off. Right there with ya. I‚Äôm gonna be 54 and I‚Äôve been dealing with this for almost three years. Make it stop, please."
112zwpc,"Ladies, do you avoid walking on grass when pavement is available? I worry about twisting my ankle on uneven ground, when I never worried about that when I was younger!"
112zwpc,Yes and I'm dizzy and the nausea is also fun!
112zwpc,"Yes. Especially recently. A few times I've woke up to really sore hands-almost a feeling of broken bones.  Like to the point where I can't do anything because they hurt bad, so I wrap them and give them a rest. But dropping things and bumping into things is really annoying too."
112zwpc,I was just thinking of this the other day how my fingers have become so ‚Äúslippery‚Äù and a fumbling mess üò¨
112zwpc,So sorry about your mug accident. I recently broke the handle off my pretty MOM mug because apparently I have zero depth perception now. I was removing it from the dishwasher and didn‚Äôt lift it high enough. Smashed it right into the kitchen counter. üòî
112zwpc,"What you describe sounds exactly like jerking seizures.  Both my Mom and my daughter have these.  We thought our daughter was just a clumsy kid as she was always tripping and bumping into things until one day I saw her kick the cabinet with her bare foot and shout in pain because it hurt.  I asked her what the heck she thought she was doing and she responded that she didn‚Äôt mean to do it - it just happened.  We had some tests done and it was discovered these were a type of seizures.  She‚Äôs on meds now and they are significantly less frequent.   Not life threatening, but definitely problematic to the safe operation of machinery if left uncontrolled - I would see a neurologist.  Seizures can develop at anytime in your life, so even if this is new behaviour doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not seizures."
112zwpc,"Oh my gosh, that sounds awful to experience. And twenty years? I‚Äôm so sorry."
112zwpc,">Also have this problem with my legs, one will suddenly kick out towards items like door jams and table legs.

Restless Leg Syndrome is such an annoying thing although sometimes it will wake me up in the night. Thankfully it isn't too bad and eating a banana which has enough potassium, electrolytes, and other trace minerals in it, several times a week, heads off the worst of the symptoms."
112zwpc,"Oh! I saw a video clip the other day with a comedian‚Ä¶ he stood on a chair and said, ‚ÄúFolks under 40 see nothing wrong with this. But folks OVER 40 you‚Äôre all nervous right now aren‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre scared I‚Äôm going to fall and hurt myself.‚Äù  And I laughed way harder than I should have. LOL."
112zwpc,"Omg the jewelry! I bought some tiny silver hoop earrings and didn‚Äôt realize they are the kind where the fastener part slides into the hoop in the back. It took me forever to get them fastened, I‚Äôm going to wear them until I die because I don‚Äôt want to deal with changing them out."
112zwpc,And god help us all in the shower
112zwpc,Indeed. I often refer to it as being like the card game (joke) of playing 52 pick up. Symptoms are just thrown into the air and you never which ones you‚Äôll have today.
112zwpc,So many bruises
112zwpc,"Oooh, my eyesight keeps sucking worse so I'm going to keep an eye (ha) on this. My mom had cataracts."
112zwpc,I‚Äôm really not used to the new me. I don‚Äôt like it. Ug.
112zwpc,"Same with the hands.  Do you feel any tingling or numbness?  I don't, my hands feel fine but then I drop something and have no idea why."
112zwpc,I hope this gets better. It's just so strange!
112zwpc,I think the memory issues are some of the worst parts of all of this (and the scariest).
112zwpc,"I fell two years ago BAD.  I was helping during a spay/neuter clinic and one of the dogs got loose.  I went to run after it and tripped over a parking curb.  8 stitches to my elbow and 3 months with a wound care specialist because a ""simple scrape"" of my shin resulted in an ulcerated wound that went rogue.  Holy hell.  I used to play roller derby for crying out loud!  Thank God I don't work in veterinary clinics anymore.  That was the last straw and my last attempt at working with animals after a 10-year veterinary career.  My pride was completely deflated after that incident."
112zwpc,Wait!? Your ankles work. I have to wear running shoes all the time even in the house or I hurt my ankles or hips or knees or yay all three sets!
112zwpc,"There's an area where I sometimes walk with my dog that has a ton of acorns on the sidewalk. I don't look up the entire time I walk through that area, it's like dodging marbles!"
112zwpc,"Oh wow. The tops of my feet get like that but I think it would be more annoying with hands. What do you wrap them in? Is it just for pressure and stability, or do you add anything topical for relief (like arnica gel or CBD oil)?"
112zwpc,"This is me, depth perception is way off.  I keep thinking I'm putting something on a flat surface and either smashing into the edge or being way above it."
112zwpc,"Damnitsomuch! My condolences to you as well. My spouse replaced the lost pottery with a new hand-made pretty purple travel coffee pottery mug from the same maker, and I keep hitting it against my microwave when rewarming my coffee, I'm concerned it will eventually suffer eventual destruction!"
112zwpc,Thanks for this valuable info. If I ever have access to health insurance or an affordable neurologist I will definitely follow up on this.
112zwpc,Yep! My mother had a similar timeline for peri as well.
112zwpc,My hands get numb sometimes. It‚Äôs aggravating.
112zwpc,Definitely. It brought on a full panic attack for me.
112zwpc,"Damn! That sucks pond scum!! Unbelievable that your body could betray you like that after a ROLLER DERBY CAREER!! There's no justice!

I'm so sorry that your confidence was deflated like that. I understand completely. I am lucky that my falls only resulted in a few bone bruises. I want my old self back.üò†ü§ï‚òπÔ∏è"
112zwpc,"Oh my gosh, that sounds so awful. I'm so sorry. (And roller derby is terrifying, btw!)"
112zwpc,"It's a 3-for-1 disability sale!

Speaking of which, I've noticed that my ankles get VERY wobbly throughout my cycle. It changes. At first it was just before my period and they'd get very weak. Now it kind of just comes and goes randomly. But I've had to change my shoes because of it too... no more ""throwing on the clogs"" to walk the dog."
112zwpc,I spend more time looking at the ground than anywhere else these days!
112zwpc,"Not the person you replied to, but Voltaren gel works great for me if my hands or anything else is sore."
112zwpc,I'm just gonna go run over a curb now
112zwpc,"Oh yeah, I‚Äôm constantly slamming dishes into my microwave as well. I startle my husband, and myself, when I do it. So loud and jarring! Best of luck with your new mug! ü§ûüèªü§ûüèª"
112zwpc,I have a pair of sneakers that easily slip on so those are easy to use. But I have to use athletic shoes if I'm going for any kind of walk. It doesn't help that I twisted my ankle about 10 years ago and it never quite healed right.
112zwpc,">Voltaren

Thank you for that tip. I had no idea you could buy topical NSAIDs! My feet hurt so much so frequently I'm going to research this a bit more. Thank you!!"
112zwpc,üòÇ my SO calls it running us aground. It happens. üòÇ
112zwpc,"If you can get it prescribed, they have a formulation of the same exact gel that's a bit stronger. I think that's the 3% vs 1%. The OTC one works well, though!

Edit: it also doesn't reek like Ben Gay. It smells like vodka for 30 seconds."
10wiz6t,"When symptoms are bothersome.

Doctors are misinformed about the timing of MHT/HRT and only think it's specifically meant for extreme cases of hot flashes and/or when we are menopausal (aka post-meno)."
10wiz6t,I was placed on Estrogen supplements after blood work was taken and showed it was low.  Started with one pill and then moved to two.
10wiz6t,Thanks. Would a specialist of some sort be better to talk to than my GP?
10wiz6t,"Ok, thanks. How long did you take them?"
10wiz6t,"Are you in Canada? If so, a GP is fine, we just have to stress (and yes even exaggerate) symptoms, stating that they are ruining our quality of life, and then demand action.  There's a section in our Wiki about navigating your medical appt which should help get you started."
10wiz6t,I am still taking them now.  Two every night until my next round of blood tests in June.  Then my endocrinologist will do in depth thyroid panel to see if my estrogen is going up or leveled off and adjust from there.  I did stop taking my low libido supplement as that is to be done two months on two months off if needed.
10wiz6t,"Great, thanks. I'm in northern Europe but I'll figure it out."
10fsyhn,Please link the actual scientific studies .
10fsyhn,Your posting history looks sus. Not one personal detail. What‚Äôs your story?
10fsyhn,"I was recently told by a gynecologist that 300 mg of Gabapentin reduces peri-menopausal night sweats.   Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a bottle sitting in my medicine cabinet for nerve issues.  That I didn‚Äôt take it at night. 

Lo and behold, it works for me.  But only for night sweats.  No other symptoms.   But damn, waking up dry in the morning is wonderful.


Edit (link to study):  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4076904/"
10fsyhn,I've been on Reveree for a few years. Not sure it works all that well.
10fsyhn,"Thats interesting! It looks like the studies are early for perimenopause (promising though!), but there's been more research done on other issues which we have in my family, so ill look more. Also gotta cross check for counteractions with other drugs being taken, or counterindications with all the conditions we have.

Thanks for posting!"
10fsyhn,"Tried it, did absolutely nothing for me."
10fsyhn,"Revaree gave me back my sex life after years of being in discomfort 24/7. After breast cancer put me in menopause, I had to take tamoxifen and Femara for years. I felt like I made the sound of rustling leaves when I walked. The bedroom is awesome again. Obviously everyone is different but it is great for me."
10fsyhn,I keep my details private but want to help others. Most of the time I just read and not comment :).
10fsyhn,"Reading this link I don‚Äôt know why they brought up the 2002 hrt study as it hints that it is legitimate?
Evidence shows it was heavily flawed research.
I get that gabapentin works but why include research from that 2002 dodgy study that ruined hrt for many women and a study that Doctors today still believe and base their prescribing of HRT on.
Grrrrrrr‚Ä¶"
10fsyhn,Sorry to hear that. Have you found something else that works better for you?
10fsyhn,Interactions! Not counteractions.  Ugh. Words are hard
10fsyhn,I tried a few different brands that did not help me but the one I linked to in the op made a Huge difference for me. Which brand did you try?
10fsyhn,Contraindications is a word that applies.
10fsyhn,"Yes! That word stands. But I wrote counteractions when I meant interactions. Had ""counter"" in my head üòÅ"

10hgtea,"Don't think you'll need it, but good luck."
10hgtea,"Omg I am so relieved to hear this..... I might make my own post about it, but I wanted to respond to you. Im weird about making my own post lol. I was fully menopausal three months ago..... I went for my first mammo last week and a couple days later my nipples started to hurt like pregnancy...I wondered if it was the mammo--it actually didn't hurt to get it done, at all?. Other day my back was hurting a LOT (I do have morning back pain, but it goes away within the hour, usually....) and I was exhausted so had a nap. Next morning I went to pee and...... blood. 15 months since my last period. And I thought, oh shit.... and here I am, full blown period. Im a bit sketched out about it, although I don't (and never really did) mind getting my period...Im both really anxious and really relieved at the same time right now..."
10hgtea,"Have you gotten a Covid vaccine right before the mammo/period? Women seem to report that triggering bleeding. 

Regardless, I hate to say it, but once you‚Äôve gone twelve months+, any bleeding should be evaluated by your doc (generally an ultrasound and then likely and endometrial biopsy).  Hormones suck. Being a woman sucks (physically, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a man!)."
10hgtea,"You should really get that checked out. After 15 months, it's highly unlikely that's a period. It may not be anything serious, but you are probably not menstruating. Anything after 12 months, you have got to get it checked."
10hgtea,"No, no shots since the initial ones when they first came out. 

I have to go in for a follow up to the mammo next week. And I have to call the locum next week. My doc is gone til April. 

To avoid doomscrolling, my husband went online. Apparently it's a fairly common thing to happen, so Im looking into it."
10hgtea,"Im calling the locum on Monday. Hopefully I get to talk to her in time. My husband and I were talking about it, because I have health anxiety (so trying not to be too freaked out by it).... But, the bleeding didn't just happen. I had all the same old period symptoms and even mentioned to him that I felt like I was going to get it (I have had a few phantoms and got all the same ones too). Pms, cranky and irritable, sore back, sore boobs/nipples, exhausted, cramping, etc. etc. This time, blood. From what I can glean, unexpected bleeding is just that, out of the blue with no warning, but Im not sure. I won't doomscroll on it. So he is LOL. There's a couple places that say it can happen. 

The worst thing is, a week before, I got a mammogram and they said that I would get a letter for a recheck, because they do that with all ""first timers"" and that's what happened. And I have to go in for that as well. So, Im double freaked out because our healthcare as at a tipping point here."
10hgtea,It's very likely not a serious problem but still important to check out!
10hgtea,"I know..üò•. I've literally got no one to even ask...and my doc's been on sabbatical since 8 months. Im trying not to lose my shit. Lol. It means a lot to me, your responding to me and making me feel better. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1105c8b,"So sorry you are going through this. The .1 mg patch wasn't nearly enough for me after going through surgical menopause at age 49. In desperation, I switched to pellets for awhile (years) and then to the estradiol pill. I have been stable on 1 mg taken transbuccally (dissolved between cheek and gum). I had been taking it vaginally (2 mg every other night) which worked just as well. (Although not applicable to you, those with a uterus should not use this method.)

You clearly need a higher dose or different method. If a higher dose estradiol patch or pill still leaves you feeling deficient, one of the pills with a longer half-life may work better. The ones that come to mind are Menest or Premarin. Another option may be estrogen injections. 

I hope you can get settled on something soon. I was in your shoes for far too long and I know how miserable it is. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1105c8b,Increase your dose. The real question is how to find a doctor who will prescribe the appropriate dose for you.
1105c8b,"My NP wrote for my patch to be changed every other day. BCBS approved it. You need to find a doc who will rx for more often.  Also, you can leave the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù patch on after adding the second one so you always have two on‚Ä¶that may help, too (I understand you‚Äôre doing pills, but in the future it‚Äôs an option).

My experience is that online providers likely will NOT prescribe things more frequently and at higher doses than ‚Äústandard‚Äù, so I‚Äôd focus on finding an in-person provider who is up to speed."

10l2vtc,Thanks for your responses. Really appreciate it. I have struggled to listen to podcasts whereas I used to like them. Now they just sound like people shouting blah blah at me in various tones but will check some of the ones you have recommended üòä
10l2vtc,Yours is pretty clever too. Happy Cake Day!
10l2vtc,[deleted]
10l2vtc,Thank you!
10l2vtc,"Yes. I can't stand it if they don't get right to the point.  It's why I don't listen to morning ""news"" shows anymore. I don't have the patience for their silly banter."
10enl9g,Bless your heart!!! You've got so much at one time. I feel you. Sending virtual hugs xo
10enl9g,"I'm sorry, friend. I can relate to a lot of this. I think trying Estroven makes sense. You have to keep trying things, one by one, until hopefully you find something that helps. Maybe you'll also get lucky and find help from a medical professional too. At least you have this community, which collectively knows more than most doctors about this utter shit that plagues us."
10enl9g,"Small update - scheduled with an OBGYN on February 16th. These next couple weeks will be hell. Hopefully the Estroven helps!! 
Not sure how I feel about it being a male doctor on the young side - it really shouldn't matter. I've been to male gynos before that were great so my fingers are crossed!!!!
It's like I'm drunk 24/7 without the drinking. Oooof"
10enl9g,"After reading your post it was like I wrote it myself! You‚Äôre not crazy or alone!!! My symptoms are exactly like yours. The pins and needles, burning feet, weakness, all of it! Went to so many doctors who kept telling me I had neuropathy even when I kept saying I thought it was my hormones. Obgyn even sent me to a neurologist. Long f‚Äôed miserable story it turns out the past 3 years of my suffering and so called undiagnosed neuropathy that they put me on so much medication for was because I was in fact perimenopausal! My labs are similar to yours now although my fsh is 42. While I wait for an appt with the lead menopausal doctor at Ucla in mid feb I decided to take matters into my own hands and started HRT. I started 2 weeks ago and let me tell you, I‚Äôm a new person!! If you‚Äôre wondering how I was able to get the HRT while I wait for appt I joined bywinona. So far the experience has been life changing. And it‚Äôs only supposed to improve more. Anyway, know there is hope and you‚Äôre not alone or crazy. The other telemedicine ones I found that seemed fantastic were defy and thrive. I just ended up going with Winona off my feeling. Look them up! And seriously consider trying. Its worth it and with all of them, they will LISTEN to you because all they deal with is hormonal imbalances plus you are taken care of the same day! Oh and by the way I just turned 43 so you‚Äôre not too young. Trust  and fight for yourself Nobody knows our bodies better than we do. Good luck!"
10enl9g,Thank you for your post. I feel many of these symptoms as well. Praying you get a doctor that will be compassionate and listen to you. üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
10enl9g,I‚Äôm with you honey. I have been having some crazy weird symptoms and it‚Äôs like pulling teeth to get help. ‚ù§Ô∏è
10enl9g,"What was your b12 levels?
If you see having neuro symptoms your B12 should be around 800.your symptoms ate of b12 deficiency."
10enl9g,"Some of your symptoms sound similar to what a friend experienced with long covid, namely the weakness, fatigue and mental fog. My friend ended up with cardiomyopathy. You may want to try to get an EKG (once you find a PCP)."
10enl9g,Thank you!
10enl9g,"Thank you.  I knew I wouldn't be alone here.

I live in very rural northern WI and I frequently say ""If we just lived in a bigger city we would get better medical care"" but deep down, I know that isn't really true.  There is a problem everywhere.

That is another thing I have really been struggling with lately is the medical system as a whole and how broken it seems to be.  It isn't even necessarily the doctors faults.  They just don't have the time to give patients one on one care anymore it seems.  I think the pandemic and now this nasty flu season just adds to the problem.  AND greed of course - push more pateints through to make  more money - refer refer refer -  but again, that isn't necessarily the fault of doctors themselves.

Relating to anyone in my everyday life just isn't happening.  Even my mom was like ""I would randomly find myself crying but other than that I didn't really notice anything""  My older sister is going through it right now too but other than the hot flashes and night sweats, she's doing pretty well with it too.  Lucky SOBs.

ETA: The thing that really gets me is it seems she wasn't even going to make the referral until I kept sending messages! I didn't just go in to find out what was wrong and then not plan on doing anything about it! Hey doc, thanks for letting me know that you think this is menopause! Toodles!"
10enl9g,"Thank you SO MUCH for this. I did actually go there and sign up!! I still plan on going to the OBGYN but at least I am not stuck in limbo waiting. I would assume this was the route they would have gone down anyway as a first step so why not start early and see if we are on the right path? 

I'm just shocked that it took less than an hour - blown away! 

I feel like at a minimum this brain fog needs to be taken care of sooner rather than later. My job right now is being flipped on it's head and I have another opportunity that I really want to pursue but am scared this brain fog is really going to make it impossible for me. Fingers crossed!!!!!!"
10enl9g,B12 was at 306
10enl9g,"Don't get me started on the dumpster fire that is the U.S. medical system! Getting good care is nothing less than a miracle. Good luck, friend."
10enl9g,Fir neurological symptoms it's low you should be above 600
10pbyq6,"It sounds like you need a hug and to hear that it's okay. All the myriad emotions are tough but you're not wrong to feel them. We so often feel as women that we have to do it all, and do it without complaint. You don't need to tell yourself that others have it worse. It's okay to say this sucks and you can't wait for it to pass. And it will pass. Try to take time for yourself while you can; take a nap, take a bath, watch mindless TV, have some hot tea. And give yourself a break mentally, because you're doing great."
10pbyq6,Hugs to you. You deserve to be ‚Äúselfish‚Äù after all you have done for others. Book a weekend getaway if you can- you deserve it! It‚Äôs like on an airplane- put on your own oxygen mask first so that you can help others. You need to get that oxygen mask on now and take care of yourself first
10pbyq6,Sending hugs ‚ù§Ô∏è so many of us are likely navigating all of this at a time when we need our moms the most. I so which there was a weekly meno night at a cafe or bar where we could all hang out. I don‚Äôt have ladies my age in my city to talk to about any of this and I sure wish I could.
10pbyq6,"Sending you lots of hugs and hope you put yourself first from now forward. I have done so much care giving to family, friends, strangers (abusive childhood will F you up) i realized last year that I was very angry and resentful of anyone or anything that needs my time or attention. This year I have vowed to only take care of myself and so far going great"
10kyc34,"I have a lot of redness as well. I've been using The Ordinary Azelaic acid cream (for rosacea and eveness), followed with my La Roche Posay cream and then Covergirl Color Neutralizing Primer (green neutralizing). These have made a big difference for me. I'm 51."
10kyc34,"see [this video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnS7_MUh5Yc/?hl=en) wrt green colour corrector.  I like her account; she has good tips. 

you can use a corrector followed by a concealer on top.  To spot conceal, make sure you use a shade that *matches* your skin tone.  Use a concealer that has a natural finish (stay away from matte concealers) and then use setting spray to set it or a super light dusting of powder).  My favourite concealer is Dior Forever skin correct."
10kyc34,"I do not have Rosacea, but, my face has become *seriously* hypersensitive lately and I found some products that soothe my face, and, make redness vanish. My seasonal allergies are going bonkers so my nasal area was always red, but it's not anymore, even if I go through a box of tissues in a day - so this stuff WORKS. I even have my husband using it (product mentioned in Step 1) when his allergies are going bonkers too because it helps his face so much.

1. ""Eucerin Redness Relief Night Cream"" - it's a very, very light lotion. I use it right after the shower in the morning, and then also at night after I wash my face. This may be all you need to see a difference.
2. ""Eucerin Anti-Wrinkle Face Cream"" - this is a heavy cream that has Coenzyme Q10 (aka CoQ10). CoQ10 is fascinating and worth reading about. Basically, we lose it as we age and with sensitive skin, it can help your skin recover. I use this at night after the Redness Relief on my whole face. In the morning I use it only on my eyelids because I have eczema on my eyelids and if I put this stuff on 2x a day in those spots, it keeps it under control.
3. I am not really a makeup person. However, I have more spots than I would like now and I'm fair skinned so they stand out. So, I do put a tiny bit of ""Bye Bye Redness Neutralizing Color-Correcting Cream"" from IT Cosmetics on some spots. It's a thick formula in a jar so I just dab a Q-tip in it and then dab that where I want it. I probably don't need this, but it makes me feel better about myself so I do.

And lastly... in the past year I became sensitive to chemical sunscreens even though I had been using them for years. So that is something to consider if you're using sunscreen, it could be contributing to the redness. For me, chemical sunscreens made my face sting, but not until many hours later so it took me forever to figure out it. I switched to ""Blue Lizard Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin"" and my face stopped stinging so much. This is a bit heavy-feeling, but, it's very moisturizing at the same time. (I use this before Step 3. above, in the mornings).

I hope this helps! It took me a while to figure out what works for me and more than anything, Eucerin products are a freaking miracle. They really help."
10kyc34,"I have rosacea and sometimes use the Maybelline CoverStick Concealer by itself. It tones down the redness on my nose and chin. It was cheap and works fine. I can get more even coverage if I also use foundation on top of it, but I WFH and am too lazy to do that most days."
10kyc34,"Your natural skintone will affect what you need, too. A lot of green color correctors are made for fair/light skinned people. They do nothing for me (medium), but I found LA Girl's green concealer is a much darker green and is therefore more useful to me.

Another idea is if you don't mind the feeling, you might like a skin tint. As long as you don't pick one that's super sheer, it'll even out your skintone but not emphasize texture. I have Pixi's H20 skin tint and also Tarte SEA Hydroflex (which is being discontinued at Sephora, so it's half price if you can still find your shade). NARS Pure Radiance is another popular one, but it was too shiny for my taste."
10kyc34,"I have rosacea. I dont like to wear makeup but from when I have: It, Clinique and Elta have good CC tinted products. Keep it simple, combine it with your sunscreen. 

You‚Äôre wearing sunscreen, right?

And, you didn‚Äôt ask, but the ONLY thing that has made a damn difference in my spider-veined skin is laser. I had the Cutera Excel, and spoke about it recently on this sub. It really did help, but it doesn‚Äôt stop it. If you don‚Äôt like wearing makeup and can throw a few hundred dollars that way, you can undo a lot of that damage. Like, A LOT. I‚Äôd much rather do this than put pigment on my face every day."
10kyc34,"Not quite an answer to what you‚Äôre asking, but my dermatologist has prescribed me Finacea gel (Azelaic acid) for years (apply morning and night). It‚Äôs done wonders for my rosacea- less bumps, more even skin tone, less redness. Highly recommend."
10kyc34,"I'm not help on the color corrector, but a derm visit might be worthwhile. I use a prescription cream for rosacea and it's made a world of difference."
10kyc34,Smashbox has a green color correcting primer but I usually use it with a power over top.  I don't think it would work strong enouhg on its own.  I also had a laser treatment to close off a lot of the broken blood vessels under the skin about 10 year ago.  That was wonderful and worth every penny.  I am thinking about going back for a touch up since I have some around my nose area.
10kyc34,"Thanks so much lovely meno warriors! 
Amazing ideas I am looking into right away!!

Something I should have added is my skin is fairly smooth for rosacea skin no bumps or acne (did have some in my 40s but now it‚Äôs just red and veiny and splotchy. I do have a super hard time with sunscreen most of it burns but like one response here it happens about an hour or two after application so I am very weary of constant spf 24/7. I am also a bare bones kinda lady just want a simple product or two I can add to my already super simple skin care routine that doesn‚Äôt feel like I am wearing a layer of product (I kinda hate makeup except a little mascara and lip moisturizer) üò¨ I guess I may be asking for something that doesn‚Äôt exist that has crossed my mind for years but you all are so supportive I thought maybe this group has the solution. I have honestly thought of using some kind of color correcting green powder, and mixing it with my own cheap moisturizer and seeing if this homemade concoction helps/works. Thanks üíó"
10kyc34,I use this. It‚Äôs amazing. https://www.spacenk.com/uk/makeup/complexion/bb-cc-cream/cc-red-correct-MUK200022468.html
10kyc34,\+1 for the ordinary azelaic acid. it has toned down my tomato face quite a bit
10kyc34,"I'm the one who mentioned the sunscreen issue. I didn't explain above, but there is a big difference between **chemical sunscreen**, and **physical sunscreen**. The ones I no longer use that cause stinging are chemical based and have ingredients such as, avobenzone, octinoxate and oxybenzone. Those ingredients are hard on skin for a lot of people.

The product I now use, Blue Lizard for Sensitive Skin, is a physical sunscreen, which uses Zinc Oxide and Titanium Oxide - which work completely differently. In fact, Zinc is very beneficial for skin repair and is quite useful. My skin feels better when I use it. I hope this helps!"
10kyc34,It has been a game changer for sure!
10kyc34,Thanks! It does help. Do the physical sunscreens stay white on the face? The physical ones I use or have used make me look ghostly ü§£ but I still choose them when I am in direct sun.
10kyc34,"You might want to try a tinted mineral sunscreen. The tint keeps the sunscreen from giving you a white cast, and offers just a hint of coverage. My fave is [paula's choice resist extra light sunscreen](https://www.paulaschoice.com/resist-super-light-wrinkle-defense-spf-30/776.html). I also like [australian gold tinted sunscreen](https://www.amazon.ca/Australian-Gold-Botanical-Mineral-Suncreen/dp/B096QRDLVH/ref=asc_df_B096QRDLVH/?tag=googlemobshop-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459124493642&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=758059886524332529&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000755&hvtargid=pla-1425675105260&psc=1). This one has a bit more coverage, but it's a thicker, goopier texture, which is why it's not my fave."
10kyc34,"It depends on how they are formulated. If you want to shop around, you can search for ‚Äúphysical sunscreen first impressions‚Äù videos on YouTube and you‚Äôll get a better idea of what may work for you because you can watch people apply them. I like the one I use but everyone is different."
10zpmds,"I‚Äôm on a similar HRT regime to you (except 200 mg of progesterone daily) and have not had negative symptoms you describe. I have found relief with HRT for my hot flashes / night sweats / extreme insomnia. I am not taking any other meds. 

I can‚Äôt imagine progesterone could be the cause of a higher heart rate than usual, as it is a calming hormone. 

In peri, you body can at random times produce erratically high levels of estrogen, and with HRT can combine to make you feel more anxiety and panic attacks (higher pulse than usual, etc). These should pass as your body levels off on its estrogen levels, as estrogen is more of an energetic hormone. 

But what is ‚Äúhigher heart rate‚Äù could be something more serious, relatively speaking. It depends what that exact level is. A higher heart rate for me would be in the 60‚Äôs, but no MD would see that as a problem. But if it gets past 90‚Äôs, it would start to be a problem. 

If you haven‚Äôt had these episodes checked out in the past by your doctor, it might be a good idea to have them checked now."
10zpmds,"I've been taking 200 mg for around 3 yrs now. I had a regular period until my very last one March 2021 when I was 53. I have had no negative symptoms at all. 

I have Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism can cause increased blood pressure and irregular heart beat. Last year I found out that the migraines, dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue was not at all caused by my Hashimoto's like I thought. It was caused by Iron Deficiency without Anemia. Once my Ferritin was brought up to over 100 all of my symptoms I just listed went away. I also had a few other symptoms: pulsing in my head and body when I laid down, pulsitile tennitus / throbbing in my ears, throbbing in my field of vision, cold hands and feet, aching hands and feet, a lot of body pain, restless leg syndrome, and muscles cramping. These also went away with Iron Infusion. I had to see a Hematologist because my Ferritin dropped to 20 even though I'd been taking Iron, C, and eating meat for years. My Hemo suspected I was losing blood somewhere. He was right! I was found to have bleeding in my small intestine. My Hematologist said that women need to keep their Ferritin over 100, so that's what where we maintain it. He also said that Iron Tablets are not well absorbed, but that liquid Iron is much better absorbed, so that's what I take daily with an Iron Infusion as needed on top of that. I frequently get an full iron panel to look for Iron Deficiency and a CBC at the same time to look for Anemia (low Hemaglobin, low RBC, low Hematocrit), and also monitor my WBC."
10zpmds,"I am hopeful everything can level off. I‚Äôm in a much better place today then 2 years ago. I‚Äôve always had bouts of dizziness and lightheadedness and have been checked my whole life only to be told everything looks great, those symptoms have just triple folded this past week. Doctors are always dismissive when I say my blood pressure is high at 120/80 because my normal is 90/60. Thank you for the response, I plan to see a cardiologist again since I‚Äôm finally documenting my symptoms and numbers, good ol‚Äô Apple Watch."
10zpmds,Thank you for your response. I just checked out my last bloods done and while all irons are in the normal range (ferritin was 27.4) they were all on the low end of normal and almost a year ago. I‚Äôll check this avenue out because a lot of the things you listed I deal with. Thank you again.
10mzrfg,"I am curious about this too, I‚Äôm having the same thing happen. I do have low thyroid that is under control, but this is a new symptom that appeared along with other peri symptoms."
10mzrfg,"I‚Äôm a broken record about reflux but it could be a culprit. It‚Äôs a sneaky condition, can show up as post-nasal drip, throat clearing, raspy voice.


https://stamfordentcenter.com/laryngopharyngeal-reflux-hoarseness/#:~:text=Laryngopharyngeal%20reflux%20(LPR%2C)%20also,need%20to%20clear%20your%20throat.

Reflux can get worse as we age as our bodies produce less stomach acid, food roils around in our stomachs, reflux ensues."
10mzrfg,"Things dry out too, and also if you sleep with your mouth open, it could be because your throat/mouth is dry which can contribute to this too."
10mzrfg,"I have this too, and I think for me it‚Äôs reflux.  I also snore now, it‚Äôs like all my sphincters are looser and don‚Äôt seal things off like they used to.  

However a friend just got diagnosed with ‚Äòsubglottic stenosis‚Äô which is an uncommon build up of scar tissue in the windpipe caused by inflammation - they think it‚Äôs autoimmune based but what‚Äôs relevant in meno land here is it‚Äôs predominantly only seen in white women, late 30‚Äôs to 50‚Äôs.  There is some research that suggests hormones play some role.   

Its diagnosed in about 2 seconds with an endoscope but women get ignored and put off so much when they complain that the average time to diagnose it is 4 years.  It can be life threatening!   I wonder how many women just put up with not being able to breathe and choke on their food."
10mzrfg,I researched it and found a few articles mentioning it‚Ä¶something about low estrogen affecting the vocal cords. Ugh I hate it but hopefully it‚Äôs just a menopause thing and nothing serious.
10mzrfg,I need to get checked for this. Thanks for the info!
10mzrfg,Thanks so much for the follow up! Ugh one more thing to add to the list
10mwsf1,If you have an iPhone the medication tracking via the Health app is really helpful.
10mwsf1,"Amazing, isn't it?"
10mwsf1,I had a patch fall off in the night..still unsure as to why. I replaced it and had a terrible migraine which I think was to do with the fall in estrogen. Mad how quickly it happened. Hope you recover quickly.
10mwsf1,I have a reminder set on my app
10mwsf1,"WOW - that is fascinating.  I just had the same thing happen.  Left for vacation, forgot my patches and the shit legitimately hit the fan.  I actually had flu-like symptoms.  Luckily CVS nearby was able to give me son - but whew.  It's incredible isn't it - and I think about all the women who are listening to their doctors saying - you're too young!!"
10mwsf1,So do I... unfortunately it didn't remind me to pack my patches in advance :)
112yqvw,"Buy a rechargeable, portable fan. I have two. A real little one that clips on and a slightly larger one that folds up. Both are worth their weight in gold. (Both recharge using USB, but with a USB converter plug you can just leave them plugged in like any regular fan."
112yqvw,"Nowadays, hotels don‚Äôt change your bedding unless you ask. They just make up your bed (if that) without changing anything. If I were you, I‚Äôd just ask for extra bedding / towels when you‚Äôre checking in.

Definitely bring some kind of portable fan with you, the last hotel I stayed in had no opening windows and no air circulation."
112yqvw,"Hi!  I travel all the time for work.  I bring two little usb powered fans everywhere.  I also bring two of my own pillowcases because my head is my sweatiest part.  When I check in I ask for a change of sheets and they are happy to oblige, and if I need more I just talk to housekeeping or front desk depending on the hotel.  Just try to make sure all that talking is when they're not super busy and not when there's only one person on at night."
112yqvw,"I travel all the time, turn the air all the way down so it‚Äôs an icebox.  Free AC!!  Love it when I can turn down the air to 64 in hotels ;) 
Also, avoid red wine that evening. I find for some reason I get a little hot when I drink it."
112yqvw,"I have not yet had this situation, but these days they have the nicest little rechargeable usb fans.  I got one.  It didn't last the entire night unplugged, but a good bit of it, and plugged in it's like a normal little fan. Had surprisingly good output for a tiny fan.   Takes up no more room than say, a cheeseburger, in your suitcase."
112yqvw,"I got a cooling blanket on Amazon and I don‚Äôt know how it works , it‚Äôs made of bamboo or something ? But it is always cold and helps so  much !"
10fgc8e,My Therapist is 15 years younger than me and she is gleaning knowledge from me. Ive told her if she needs a subject for Professional Development courses then consider Peri and Meno because it is woefully misunderstood and I told her to come and check out this amazing sub.
10fgc8e,"Not quite the same but my GP just retired and her replacement is in her early 30s and although I am sure she is a great doctor I miss the rapport I had with my old doc; I was with her for almost 30 years and I used her as a bit of a therapist, she was with me through infertility, my divorce, cancer, so much!

Plus this new gal has not a single clue about anything menopausally related, she just wants me to get my Paps on time and go for mammos when I am supposed to. so, I just don't bother to bring it up. Also, this has all happened since covid so I haven't even met her in person, all my apportionments are via Zoom.

So I kinda get where you are coming from."
10fgc8e,"I‚Äôve had these same concerns myself. I just started seeing a therapist who is probably mid to late 30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm 51. She has 2 toddlers and I have 2 in college. I‚Äòve only seen her twice so far, but she‚Äôs given me some good advice and good tips to deal with some health anxiety I was having. And honestly, it‚Äôs just nice to have a neutral party with whom I can get things off my chest. So I‚Äôll probably keep seeing her a couple times a month or as needed.   


But I did start my therapist search looking for ones my age or older, but they were all booked out until summer, as a lot of people are struggling right now with mental health issues. So I just settled on one whose profile clicked the best with me and who had better availability. She can‚Äôt prescribe meds but that makes her less expensive. (Couldn‚Äôt find one covered under my crappy health insurance.)  

Hope you can find one that brings you at least some of the things you‚Äôre looking for. The challenges in this stage of life come at us from all directions, so the more people we can put ‚Äòin our corner‚Äô, the better!"
10fgc8e,"Yes. Not sure how much younger she is than me. I love the new way that therapy is now. There are actually exercises or skills that help instead of mulling over the same topic. She's brilliant and I feel she helps me keep young. One particular time we were on tele-health and my face turns bright red out of nowhere! (hot flush) I ask ""What is that about?!"" and we laughed it off. In a future session she told me the same thing had happened to her and she thought of me so I'd like to think we are learning from each other."
10fgc8e,"I prefer therapists my own age or thereabouts.  You mentioned concerns of them being angry or short-tempered, and I've not found that to be the case, nor have they been stuck in outdated mindsets.  Good luck."
10fgc8e,"My GP, physio, and the therapist I briefly had last year (limited block of sessions from that service, I'd have them back like a shot) are all in their thirties, I reckon, and are superb. They don't need to have been through everything in your life to understand you. Also the younger ones have more recent training and are more up to date and less likely to assume they know it all already. OK, that's more a doctor thing, but I think it applies here.

Getting someone neurodivergent-friendly is important for me. My doctor isn't neurodivergent that I know of, but is very supportive. I reckon my physio probably is, I found her because she specialises in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which she has herself, and people with EDS are generally neurodivergent. Even if she isn't, she totally gets it when I explain that I'm having trouble with an exercise because my mind keeps wandering, for instance. 

As for the therapist, they said they're not neurodivergent as far as they know, which would make them the first neurotypical trans person I've met, but they're queer community, which is a huge thing to have in common, and since the trans community in particular is heavily neurodivergent, this means they're used to neurodivergent folks, it'll be most of their friends. They absolutely got me, and were the first therapist I've had who was genuinely helpful. Most just go blank when you start the ADHD rambling."
10fgc8e,"Yes, my therapist is at least a decade younger than I am and knows nothing about peri or menopause except what I have explained. And it's totally fine, she is very empathetic and understanding and she's very knowledgeable about the type of mental health treatment I need. (Which while it is worsened by lack of hormones isn't really about menopause.)"
10fgc8e,Yes. Tired now but I really appreciated her attempts at building mindfulness as my life was falling apart/turning upside down. I would love to find someone older than myself who can advise me how things get better.
10fgc8e,"I SO RELATE TO THIS.  When my psychologist of five years (the longest therapist of any kind that I‚Äôve ever had) raised her prices, it was no longer affordable for me, so I had to switch. 

I have tried two therapists, who are obviously younger than me, and totally feel like they don‚Äôt get me. I am now starting to talk to a new therapist who is my age and retired from corporate work. She does therapy now mostly with women between 40-60 because she wants to help. I am hopeful that she will work out for me.

I would recommend going on your health insurance website and doing a provider search for a therapist. Then go through them and check their websites. You‚Äôll find their pictures on their own practice websites and education information, like when they graduated, that will give you an idea of how old they are.

Good luck, my sister!!!!üíú"
10fgc8e,"nice, yeah. i dont know if i have the energy for that so much when i'm paying them, although im happy to tell the young uns to look into it!

is she helping you with live or your issues?"
10fgc8e,I feel like the most care and understanding I get lately comes from older women who see me fanning myself in the produce aisle. Those little knowing smiles of support are day-savers.
10fgc8e,"She is free..She is employed by the mental health team at the hospital so she comes to my home for a visit and takes me to some appointments. 

She is an RN and sometimes has student Nurses on rotation with her and that's cool so I don't really mind but every one of them has been surprised to hear about my journey and want to look into it further. I tell them to check out this sub as a fantastic resource."
10m0rx9,"Following. I‚Äôve read and heard the same thing, that progesterone cannot be absorbed through the skin. BUT, on the flipside of that, I have also read reviews of so many women that use progesterone cream and it helps them so much. Surely all the women aren‚Äôt have placebo effect, right?"
10m0rx9,[deleted]
10m0rx9,"Some find progesterone cream helps with some symptoms, but it's not recommended to use if you are using estrogen as well, because it's not absorbed well via skin, and there's no guarantee it's providing adequate protection to your uterus.  So if you're not taking estrogen and it seems to be working for you, then just see how it goes."
10m0rx9,Are you taking both the oral and cream right now?  What brand is your cream?
10m0rx9,Hi are you using one pump daily and continuously through your cycle?
10m0rx9,"I actually started using progesterone cream this month to see if it would help some of my peri symptoms and it has made such a difference with my anxiety (or coincided with a huge decrease in my anxiety for some other reason). I go back and forth about whether or not I should continue and whether it‚Äôs safe, but I‚Äôm also so grateful to be experiencing less anxiety!"
10m0rx9,i know.  i was certain nothing would happen....
10m0rx9,Wow has it had a real positive effect on mood?
10m0rx9,"yew, i'm a few days into oral dose at 100mg.  next month i go to 200 mugs.  this is the cream: https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Identical-Progesterone-Advanced-Delivery-Pro-Relief/dp/B01N12IXCM/ref=sr\_1\_2\_sspa?crid=3LNGQP86Q4E52&keywords=progesterone%2Bcream%2Bfor%2Bwomen&qid=1674853709&sprefix=%2Caps%2C60&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWMkRNMzU4UlgyU0EmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4MzU4ODMyQVFYVjlWU0sxVkU5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5MjIwODAxV0QzMFBLSkcxRzhCJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1"
10m0rx9,i've been using one or two pumps daily and continuously.
10m0rx9,"That‚Äôs great! How much are you using? Daily or for only 2 weeks every cycle? Just progesterone cream, or estrogen too?"
10m0rx9,"Are you still cycling normally using it continuously? This is where I get confused. I would like to try the cream, and I am waiting for my first period to start since getting off birth control pills. If I try it and it I like it, I will probably want to use it continuously. My main issues are sleep and anxiety."
10m0rx9,"Just progesterone- I do it all month except for my period, because my anxiety is at its worst during the first half of my cycle. I use one pump of the pro-gest brand cream."
11357s2,"I can relate. Really wish I couldn't, but yeah. I wish I had an answer, but you're not alone.   


This comic hit me hard. Like, it's funny, but I also can't get it out of my head because, yeah   
https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/yer-mom"
11357s2,"I can relate to all of this. I think it's part of this ""Change"". It really is a time of crisis, as cliche as the concept ""midlife crisis"" sounds. We're morphing into different people - physically, emotionally, and intellectually. For me the challenge is to keep accepting the changes, because I'm not seeing things getting *better* day by day, just the opposite. When you're young you look forward to everything - getting a driver license, sex/romance, being of drinking age, moving out on your own. But now it's a matter of waking up to assorted pains, forgetting the simplest things, losing patience with people and the world in general. What I'm saying is, what you're experiencing is normal. You're going to be OK, but it's a rough rough time."
11357s2,"I had a hysterectomy last summer (cancer - they got it all, but now I'm in treatment to keep it gone). I realized very recently that it wasn't a surgery to fix what was wrong, and then I heal up and go about my life. It was a surgery that profoundly changed pretty much everything I knew about myself. I imagine that going through menopause, on its own schedule, would be similar, albeit slower.

My anxiety is worse. Depression has increased. I have ADHD, and am so much more distracted than ever before. I feel like I've aged so quickly in the past year. I do feel very much lost, because everything I could count on before the surgery - simple things, like emotion regulation, body temperature regulation, productivity, etc - is very different now. I want to hide and cry and sleep, but I know that I can't give in completely, because that makes the anxiety, etc grow stronger.

I started seeing a counselor again, and my doctor put me on breakthrough-anxiety meds, in addition to my dailies. I'm trying to be gentle with myself, but it's really, really hard, since everything's changed so quickly. I can't keep up with myself.

You're not alone. This is really hard."
11357s2,Have you considered volunteering with diverse organizations (charities) to see if any of them light a passion?
11357s2,"My kids are 19 and almost 15 and I stayed home up until fairly recently. Now, I‚Äôm part time, doing gig work but I love it. I love my students (I teach beginner English to immigrant adults) but one of the 3 jobs is unnecessarily stressful (for the shit pay) because it‚Äôs non profit and the ED is‚Ä¶.not a great manager. Also, I don‚Äôt make jack shit and no health insurance except through my husband‚Äôs employer.

Honestly, it all pisses me off. Motherhood and it‚Äôs responsibilities have never had a monetary value in the history of the world. We‚Äôre expected to be the primary childcare provider, chauffeur, medical appointment maker, maid, and sex goddess for our entire adult lives ‚Äî never mind that we push human babies the size of a melon out of our nethers. Oh, and also find a career that‚Äôs fulfilling **and** allows for days off for when your kid is sick or, god forbid, when you‚Äôre sick. Actually, we aren‚Äôt allowed to get sick. 

Is it a wonder why we don‚Äôt know who the f we are by the time we‚Äôre middle aged‚Ä¶.if we ever did in the first place?"
11357s2,"It can be a difficult time when your kids become teens and don‚Äôt need us the way they used to. When they do need you, it‚Äôs usually random, and they need it 24/7. You can‚Äôt plan around it. You‚Äôre doing your job! Good mom. I tried to keep them in food, which was also nearly impossible, as they would blow thru the house and food just seemed to disappear in their wake. They were always hungry. I drove them to their activities until they got old enough and experienced enough to drive themselves. I felt so unnecessary. But in fact you being there gives them the grounding to do what they need to do. 

Your introspection is a good sign, imho. Just try not to take things personally, whatever is going on in usually not personal. You are raising amazing kids that are our collective future, and doing it without thanks or acknowledgment.  I see you. Your work is valuable. You only have a few more years with your kids there with you, maybe take advantage of that?

I took a class for women re-entering the workforce thru community Ed. They walked us through looking at our home making career and extracting the areas in which that translates into the greater world. It really helped me so much to look at myself differently. And then help me prepare myself for the next stage of life, even though it didn‚Äôt lead to a job because that was in 2009. But I really liked how it helped me reframe my life and what I can do and what I had already done, into what I could do in the future."
11357s2,"If you are reasonably active, consider getting a part time seasonal job at an independent garden center. It‚Äôs my year-round job, and we hire all ages for seasonal positions. If you worked for me, you would be unloading racks of flowers and vegetables, watering plants, keeping things tidy, and helping customers. Attitude and reliability are much more important than experience."
11357s2,"I know who I used to be, but I'm not that person anymore.  It's like I'm not anyone anymore!  So weird."
11357s2,"I can relate! For me, peri has included extreme anxiety, depression, and joint injuries. I can‚Äôt take estrogen because of blood clot history so I take progesterone, which makes my joints and muscles hurt so much. I feel like I suddenly aged 40 years at the same time I am supposed to be figuring out my life again since my kids are now in school all day. Who am I?"
11357s2,"Just start small. Be the best *YOU* that you can be each day. When something resonates, explore it. It helps to focus on service to others, so your own life doesn't seem to overwhelm your thoughts or you don't get fixated on something, finding problems where there aren't any really. I'm only saying this because I'm right there too. Feeling invisible."
11357s2,I have felt like this the past year since I quit my job because I just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. My therapist recommended the book ‚ÄúThe Artists Way‚Äù by Julia Cameron. It is a kind of a workbook to discover self through creativity. It may be worth trying.
11357s2,"Holy shit. I posted this same thing 30 seconds ago.  I have a 13 year old and a 16 year old. I'd blame my job, but honestly, it was the only thing that made me smile (but also scream, growl, and break down in tears). I am a teacher, so...yeah.  God I feel so terrible and abnormal.  I told my very loving husband I was very sad and borderline suicidal.  I have never felt like the therapy type. I never felt like this in all my years.  I love my life, dammit, and I feel so incredibly unhappy."
11357s2,"Omg it's like I wrote this lol. I was just telling my friend last week: ""I've had a revelation in all of this stagnation, lack of progress: I'm just lazy now, period.""
I know a professional would say this is a form of depression but I've been clinically depressed before so I'd practically laugh. That was absolutely horrible, scary.

I am totally half assing stuff as you describe. In every sector of life (and 100 percent in sex/dating - i have zero libido.)

My situation: total hysterectomy while fertile due to tumors, no guidance or help after on hormones (don't even get me started on the medical world in this, so angry.)
Given many different antidepressants. Wellbutrin motivated me a decade ago in a bout but doesn't now.
Testosterone pellet is working! Finally something! 
But it's not the answer, not enough, never felt the same since hysterectomy and so I cry because it was a different lifetime. 

You're not alone if that is any consolation. And you've got a lot in your life, keep soul searching.
 
P.S. forget about accounting or any other job defining you! Be glad you got out of something that wasn't for you!"
11357s2,"I feel this with you
I‚Äôm 43, my kids are 18 and 15, I haven‚Äôt worked since 2002. I don‚Äôt have any friends. My mom has dementia, so I can‚Äôt confide in her. 
Do you ever feel like a wasted life. Yes I love my kids. But now they don‚Äôt need me as much I‚Äôm lost

üò≠üò≠üò≠"
11357s2,"Totally relate to this. I'm 48, kids are 14 and 11 so I'm not needed as much, but still need to be around so can't plan anything.....everything revolves around what they're doing. Also work full time from home and have 5month old puppy (why?!) Complain to husband that I have no life and don't really exist outside of home....he asked me what I wanted to do and what I liked doing... I literally had no answers üò≠"
11357s2,"I relate. Last year I really tossed myself into growing food and did swell (with some things.) It's extremely zen to prune tomatoes. In July when they started fruiting, you could smell them half a mile down the road. The simple delight of laying next to my tomato plants and just deep inhaling it was exhilarating. I loved tickling the flowers to get the plants to pollinate. I would take my time, sometimes even laying on my side or back in the grass and just pull a vine down and snip it. I got sick as hell with covid in July too, and about all I could do was just raise some passthru snips and shape up the plants.

You have to find a small pleasure and cling to it."
11357s2,Mostly I wish I could have stayed home with my kid when they were growing up but I guess I‚Äôm glad I have a career even though I would also like to retire. I feel like I‚Äôm making a soda suicide. All the things please!
11357s2,I(41f) was here.  I got rid of my estrogen through lupron and eventually will have a hysterectomy. It gave me my life back.

11357s2,"Have you considered working for a temp agency doing short-term assignments in your area? I did this for 2 years and I picked the assignments that I wanted. Some lasted a couple months, others as little as a single day.  It helped me get out of the funk that I was in and sharpened my admin/accounting skills that had gotten rusty.   It was pretty rewarding, too."
11357s2,"Join a gym and if you enjoy it, maybe you can learn to be an instructor or trainer.  What else interests you?  Gardening?  Fashion?  Start there‚Ä¶with your natural interests.  Also, don‚Äôt underestimate the value of your constant presence in your kids‚Äô lives.  Even at this age, you‚Äôll look back and know you spent your time wisely."
11357s2,"I‚Äôve come back to myself more now days, but I found that through yoga of all things and I just started yoga again. Yoga makes not thinking okay and not being anybody okay for me.   
Maybe you could start with what‚Äôs your favorite color, what‚Äôs your favorite food, and after you have the basics down what are your values? Do you value religion, or do you value nature more? Make a list or write it down you‚Äôll find a core self sooner than later that already exist even if it‚Äôs not verbalized as of yet."
11357s2,Damn. Sociologists coming in hot.
11357s2,"I have never had a comic speak so directly to me.

11357s2,Ouch!

11357s2,"I couldn't do it, I knew I couldn't do it, maybe some can do it all work and parenting and relationship and the whole 9 yards, but they are not me.  And so therefore I never had kids.

11357s2,Oh my goodness I want to do this so much!
11357s2,That's something to consider! Thanks!
11357s2,"Same! I just said to my husband the other day that he‚Äôs the same person as he was 20 years ago, but I have no idea who I am anymore. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm starting to watch my cheeks slide down my face creating the jowls I remember my grandmother having. ‚òπÔ∏è"

11357s2,Thank you!
11357s2,I'll look into it... thanks!
11357s2,I see you. Look into therapy. I do it through Cerebral. It's all online and it's not very expensive. It's so helpful to be able to vent to someone who doesn't know you. You can vent all you want. And a good therapist will know how to gear the conversation to something productive. I had a pretty good turnaround in attitude and love for myself after only a couple of months. It saved me in a lot of ways.
11357s2,">My situation: total hysterectomy while fertile due to tumors, no guidance or help after on hormones (don't even get me started on the medical world in this, so angry.)

But it's not the answer, not enough, never felt the same since hysterectomy and so I cry because it was a different lifetime. 

I feel you! But glad to hear the T pellet is working! Hormones are powerful! 

I'm also *very angry* with the medical world due to the unwarranted removal of my organs for a benign ovarian cyst. And then to add insult to injury, my long-time gyn/surgeon dropped me as his patient when the patch he Rx'd was not working *at all*. He didn't give a crap that I was suicidal and a mess in every other way. 

Although getting enough estrogen in my body has made a big difference, it has not reversed the rapid aging (hair loss and graying, skin collagen loss, loss of muscle mass). I didn't get any discernible benefits from testosterone pellets. I'm now using gel but the jury's still out.

And hormones cannot fix the anatomical effects of hysterectomy - bladder and bowel changes, figure changes, loss of uterine orgasms. And the uterus also appears to play a role in libido, mood and ""personality"" if you read some posts from those who kept their ovaries. We don't know if those changes are hormonal (due to impaired ovarian function) or from the loss of the uterus itself.  

I find it troubling that there is so much censoring / canceling of negative posts on hysterectomy ""support"" sites whether they are personal experiences or medical studies. One thing many fail to consider is that a lot of the posts are from those who aren't that far out from surgery. There are very few who are years post-op. Many of the after effects happen in the longer-term. Also, the trade-offs may be worth it for women who have a hysterectomy for chronic debilitating pain but less so for other conditions.

I hope things keep improving for you!"
11357s2,Thank you...I'm so sorry you weren't taken care of better medically! Hearing about that stuff makes me so angry! It sounds like you're making your way though! Good luck to you!
11357s2,"I feel this soooooo much! We went to a bar with a group of people we didn't know very well (it's 5 minutes from our house so thought why not?). I was asked what I do and when I said ""I'm at home right now"" I got a blank stare by one woman. I really hate those questions. I never know what to say. Ugh"
11357s2,I feel like there is no right answer. Anything we do is wrong by societal standards.
11357s2,Awesome!

11357s2,I get it. Ugh

11357s2,"I have considered it. I guess the only thing holding me back are a couple of things: 1) I haven't interviewed since '04. I have a lot.of anxiety with that. 2) The last time I used a temp agency (Robert Half), the dude kept setting me up for failure by having me interview for jobs I had no business interviewing for (which only made my anxiety worse. Lol)

BUT, this might just be the perfect jumping off point for me. I can get over some anxiety by just diving in. And an interview with a temp agency for actual temp jobs is totally different than one with a company looking for full-time. 

Thank you for this. You've inspired me. üôÇ"
11357s2,"Thank you, for sharing your experience, so I know I'm not alone either. Peace to you, my friend."
11357s2,"I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this. I had a hysterectomy scheduled and cancelled it, and providers keep throwing out that I could have one. They hand them out like candy but act like hormones are the devil. I don‚Äôt understand it at all. I had heavy bleeding and large clots. Guess what has helped tremendously? Micronized progesterone. I finally got a provider to give me an Rx. I‚Äôm also sleeping much better now and I think my hair is thickening a bit after hair loss from bcp. 

Anyway, I understand hysterectomy‚Äôs in cases of cancer, endometriosis, etc but I don‚Äôt understand why they suggest them for everything else."
11357s2,"You really nailed it; I only learned of the anatomical changes recently, of how your organs actually ""drop"" into these empty spaces, and how just frankly bizarre and hard it is for the body to lose organs suddenly. It baffles me how Drs aren't ALL holistic/integrated med Drs. I mean, anybody can see we're a system operating!

I feel bitterly angry that I was basically bullied into my organ removals only to be told after that, well those weren't dangerous after all, but wow is that a relief. I was gobsmacked. Oncology told me stuff like might turn into in the future, could be right now but we won't know til we're literally in there...
Nobody I know told me to think it over either. My sister said omg you lucky, never have your period again! 

As you say, the grey hair, total body morph (boobs D to B for me) and fat distribution from hips to belly, muscle loss, and yes skin, list on and on. And none of this is fixable, right. Maybe with a magic hormone Dr, $$$, some of it. I already got a boob lift and implants because the hysterectomy deflated them too fast for skin to adjust.  And yes great orgasms are in the past now, that's proven I've read. 

And not one fucking medical person ever told me about even the possibility of any of this. In fact the head oncologist said nothing will change really since you're 45 already. 

When the surgery robbed these years from me I wonder about literally. I've never heard it shortens your life but I have read it dramatically increases your cardiovascular risks due to the complexities of hormones and cholesterol. 

All that makes me feel better is thinking well if any tumors morphed into cancer later on you'd be so regretting not having your organs out. How accurate that is I don't know. I've read now that it's just far, far easier to remove ""useless"" organs. Problem solved."
11357s2,Truth.
10o59r3,"What symptoms are you experiencing? Do you want your hormones checked so they'll prescribe HRT? Your doctor should be using your symptoms as a guide for navigating any hormone prescriptions - she's right in the sense that they generally don't use sex hormone tests for diagnosing women in peri, but at your age you'd think that your *symptoms* would spark in her the need to identify their source, since she must know you are totally within the peri zone in terms of age! Jeez. Anyway getting your thyroid checked is usually recommended in peri anyway, so at least you've got that out of the way despite your doc not seeming to be interested in alleviating your symptoms now that they're not thyroid related. 

For quick relief I have a few suggestions - one: go on the low-dose pill - doctors throw the pill at us like candy, with all their objections to prescribing shit, they are always in love with prescribing the pill. The good part is the low-dose pill is nothing like the birth control pills from back in the day and is truly a very low dose of hormones that nevertheless even out our cycles, replace estrogen and progesterone, and for most of us alleviate hot flashes, most of the brain fog, anxiety and mood swings, things like that. Zaps lubrication and libido in my case, so I added in testosterone and solved most of my issues. I bet if you asked obstructionist doctor for a low dose pill ""I don't want to get pregnant"" - they'd throw it at you. 

Two, you can see an online telemed company specific for menopause related issues. The positive is you will likely have more options for the type of relief you'd like. The negative is if you live in the US, only some of them take insurance. The prescriptions should be covered as far as your insurance goes, but sometimes the telemed visit is out of pocket. I spent $60 on one televisit in 2021, so it's not egregious but is still more than the average copay. We've had people post about positive experiences with MIDI, Gennev and Evernow as a starter. 

Three, obv you can doctor shop by looking at the [NAMS doctor search](https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx) if you're in the US (sorry, can't tell from your writing where you are). I've had mixed luck with it, one totally dire dud of a doctor and one who is borderline okay. 

(If you're not in the US, sorry I think ideas 2 and 3 are US specific!)"
10o59r3,"She‚Äôs full of shit. You need a new doctor. I was 100% done with peri and in full menopause by 48. My mom was also in menopause by the time she was 49. 

Your doc is a Moron."
10o59r3,"I highly recommend investing the time to read the wiki in this group. Testing is not the answer. It took me literally 3 sittings to read the entire wiki, and I‚Äôm so glad I did!"
10o59r3,Not testing hormones is one thing - they vary so much that it isn't really recommended to bother with.  HOWEVER - a doctor that says 43is too young for Peri is a doctor that apparently doesn't know what they are talking about.  How difficult will it be to replace them?
10o59r3,"I had horrendous peri symptoms which started disrupting my life when I was 42. Not diagnosed till 45. Lost my health, relationships, job‚Ä¶ 46 now and I have to rebuild my life. Doing much better now though. Thankfully I found a new dr who _saved_ my life. Please find a new dr who believes in the physiological process that will happen to everyone (ETA:) born with a uterus should they live long enough. Even a few months trial of HRT would give you an answer."
10o59r3,"Hormone testing is not horribly helpful due to normal fluctuations, which makes using hormone testing not terribly helpful for management of perimenopause. Typically MDs manage based on symptoms. Plus, even IF hormone levels are ‚Äúoff‚Äù it really won‚Äôt change how the MD manages the symptoms.
(I‚Äôm a nurse and I‚Äôm the midst of peri, too)"
10o59r3,"Time for a new doctor. Or show your doctor this:

https://youtu.be/uEZpg0n7jcY

Peter Attia MD describes the article on the faulty reports on hrt for peri women

I recall starting to notice changes around age 35. I was heavily into exercise and my symptoms were minimal. Periods gradually decreased in strength to age 42. Thought I was done, got a period, and next thing you know. I was pregnant. Had a daughter at 43. Wild hormonal ride. Post part um depression.  On top of already doctoring for major depression. 

Back to peri, BUT I was so busy focusing on depression,  trying so many drugs the side effects of which overlap peri that I didn't realize I was doing ""double duty"". I am now 64 and burned out. 

To arm yourself with the education that I wish I had, look at the book: Menopause Your Management Your Way by Dr. Barbara Taylor. 

EVERYTHING about menopause,  every stage, and options for self-care and disease prevention. 

She is also on YouTube,  under Menopause Barbie. 

You can schedule an online visit with her here:
  menopausetaylor.me"
10o59r3,Tests are pointless during peri but the real concern is she thinks 43 is too young for peri. She‚Äôs completely uninformed and untrained in menopause. Fire her
10o59r3,"Since your doctor doesn't ""believe in perimenopause"" - something every woman experiences to one level or another, it sounds like the first step is really going to a different doctor. However, if you really want to fight it out with her, one other tactic you can try is to inform her that **you want it noted in your medical file that she is refusing to do the medical tests you've requested**. Most doctors cave at that request assuming it's a threat of a lawsuit or that she'll be liable if something isn't found that should have been. But if she doesn't believe in something that happens to all of us, I wouldn't trust her medical care or advice - ever."
10o59r3,I‚Äôve never heard of anyone having their hormones checked. If you have perimenopausal symptoms you are perimenopausal. Just ask a doctor for treatment. Most doctors can do this. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a specialist.
10o59r3,"From research I have read and advice of my doc, hormone testing tells you very little because there is a range and what your range is now-- has no reference to what it was. Doc told me no point until 1 to 2 years past no period, no breakthrpugh bleeding and over 50. 

Also, treatimg for symptoms can begin at anytime. MHT is to treat symptoms at lowest level possible while getting results."
10o59r3,"Mine agreed to test my hormones, then was dismissive when the levels were consistent with post-menopause. Got a second opinion from a menopause specialist who was very surprised I was still having occasional periods because my levels were consistent with post-menopause. Neither would consider prescribing hormone therapy until no period for 365 days, so the test results were of no value in that sense."
10o59r3,"Ask your endocrinologist to test your hormones.  My endo is tracking my symptoms for hormonal issues, not my Gyn.  The trick is to find a doctor who is tracking the issue, regardless of their specialty. Your primary care doctor could probably test you too if they are tracking these types of issues."
10o59r3,Get a new doctor. My period stopped at 47 and never returned. I‚Äôm 58 now.
10o59r3,"Hi!  44 here an and in boat when it comes to GYNs and figuring this out.  So I said f this and stopped going to a GYN.  Come to find out that thyroid disorders share over 75% of the same symptoms as Perimenopause.   My endocrinologist and one of his colleagues, who is in woman‚Äôs health, helped me to diagnose that YES I am in Perimenopause and have been since about a year ago.  The deciding factors were 1-2 day heavy period, pain in ovaries/uterus area randomly through out my cycle with no period to follow,  and now my estrogen dipped really low plus my already low sex drive DISAPPEARED completely.   

Was told to take OTC supplements for Estrogen and low sex drive.   Hubby took it upon himself to get us Lube when I told him so that ‚Äúwe are prepared for any other symptoms that affect us‚Äù in the sex department."
10o59r3,My mother was in her early 40's when she went into menopause. Get a different gyno.
10o59r3,"""To be honest the doctor pretty much said she doesn‚Äôt believe in perimenopause and therefore referred me to all the other doctor to rule stuff out. She is very unwilling to believe me.""

You need a new doctor."
10o59r3,"The way your doctor should evaluate peri is clinically (not with a hormone test). You should be prescribed HRT, then monitor if your symptoms abate. If they do, you had low estrogen and will feel better, confirming peri. If the HRT doesn't help, then there's something else going on.

Find a doctor who is actually up on current research. Plenty of women start peri in their late 30s. I had all the mental symptoms you describe and hot flushes absolutely points to peri as the culprit."
10o59r3,"I'm 41 and been in peri since 38/39. Hormone tests don't diagnose but my GP checked mine after ruling out EVERYTHING else. My results were 'consistent with perimenopause' whatever the fuck that means. 

Switch your GP. I had to hand my notebook over to mine and when she saw my list of extensive issues she listened. Still said I'm too young but heyho I'm not. It's a joke to be dismissed.

It's hard but you just gotta challenge and keep on self advocating. You know your body so just keep on pushing until you get HRT. X"
10o59r3,Maybe lie about symptoms to get some HRt or find a new Dr.
10o59r3,"You could get the test done yourself through a site like Walk-in Lab or Jason Health. There are several others. Jason Health is likely the least expensive. 

You select and pay for the tests, then schedule an appointment at Quest or LabCorp, and get your results a few days after your blood draw. 

The downside is that your insurance will not cover the test without doctor authorization. A few states do not allow patient ordered tests. 

>LabCorp: Online lab testing is prohibited in NY, NJ, RI, MD, and MA. 

>Quest: Online lab testing is prohibited in NY, NJ, and RI.

Also, that is at a point in time. The same test taken a few days later could have different results."
10o59r3,Get a new doctor
10o59r3,44 and I am around three years in I reckon. On HRT but paid privately. My mom was done and in menopause at 51. I started my periods earlier than she did though by about two years. Not sure if that matters but the doctor who prescribed me HRT said because my periods started when I was quite young this impacts when you start peri.
10o59r3,How can a doctor not ‚Äúbelieve in perimenopause‚Äù? That‚Äôs like a doctor saying they don‚Äôt believe in hypothyroidism or diabetes which are also low states of hormones.
10o59r3,Replace her and write a grievance letter to your insurance.
10o59r3,"Try a new endo that helps women with testosterone. Best thing I ever could have done. Full sex drive, tissues back to normal, 90%reduction in hot flashes, energy better. My endo is progressive and did hormone labs and saw that I couldn‚Äôt take anymore estrogen than I was already taking and it was NOT helping any of it, now I do testosterone shots weekly. Very little side effects for me and it‚Äôs done so much for me physically overall."
10o59r3,Stay here for a bit and hormone tests are unreliable
10o59r3,"1. Find another doctor 
2. Get blood test done to ensure you are not vitamin deficient- I thought I was in Peri as well but was massively low in Vitamin D of all things."
10o59r3,New obgyn
10o59r3,New doc asap
10o59r3,"This happened to me at your age !! I trusted my Doctors and went on my merry little way,‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm soon to be 59 and went through the whole nightmare of menopause without anything, and to this day my hormones have never been tested. I would strongly suggest you demand to be tested, I believe it‚Äôs your right !!!
FYI ~ I now have fairly severe osteoporosis which could have been lessened or possibly avoided if I had been placed on Bio-identical Hormones back in the day üòö,‚Ä¶ not to mention fairly severe depression/anxiety during that time as well‚Ä¶"
10o59r3,Find a new doctor!
10o59r3,Mirror what others have said - NEW DOC - STAT.  It took me a lot of research to find out that less than 10% of OB's are trained in meno - they make their money on obstetrics and we get ignored.  A decent starting place is finding a doc who's NAMS certified.  Checking hormones is typically not done in peri bc it's a time when your hormones can rollercoaster in a 24 hour period.  What are your symptoms?  You can get HRT online - MyAlloy - I did that at first before I found a decent doc.  I'm so sorry you're going through this - way too many of us are.  My symptoms started at 40 -- started off slow then WHAM.  I went through 6 docs to get to one that had really read all the recent research.
10o59r3,"My regular GP tested my hormones. Though, truthfully, hormonal tests are more like a weather vane. Meaning... I think getting them tested annually is a good idea to track if they are decreasing. I've watched the gap widen between my progesterone and estrogen, I'll tell you that. It's nuts. My hormones are still ""normal"" on a test, but their numbers are gradually decreasing and the ever-present abyss between my progesterone and estrogen is gradually increasing.

The reason my levels are still ""normal"" is because the numerical ranges for normal are insane. For estrogen in premenopausal women (aka perimenopausal women) it's like 30 pg/mL to 400 pg/mL.

Are you seriously gonna tell me a person is gonna feel normal with 30 pg/mL of estrogen when those levels are normal all the way up to 400?

The bottom line is... the medical community needs to redefine ""normal"". The symptoms we experience are ""normal"" insomuch that they are biologically expected and quite common, but they are not a *normal* way to live."
10o59r3,"There‚Äôs a woman on Insta who talks about this - I think her page is called the Galveston Diet. She says there is no test you can get for peri anyway and that it‚Äôs basically a checklist of symptoms. She says some Australasian Medical something group have an accepted questionnaire and she has a version of it on her website. Load the front page, scroll to the bottom. So maybe your Obgyn is doing you a favour if there‚Äôs no test for peri, but I‚Äôd still expect them to handle some treatment for you, not just send you away."
10o59r3,"Claim you're having interruption in menses. I got tested because my periods suddenly stopped for 2-3 months when i stopped birth control and the pregnancy test was negative. I was 37. They then tested my FSH levels and they were way too high, indicating perimenopause.

On the other hand, if you're not on bc right now, getting on it can control symptoms sometimes. For me, bc was hiding my perimenopause until i stopped it."
10o59r3,"You most certainly are not too young for it, especially if you got your first period early like I did (age 9). I was in peri for years and just didn't know it.

look around in your area to see if there is a functional medicine doctor. that's what I have and she is all about labs. She also treats my thyroid problems, and she likes to get a complete picture across the board every 6 months or so. Having several years of labs behind us gives us a basis from which to operate. Because yes, anyone lab test is a snapshot result, a moment in time.

But had I not been getting comprehensive labs done regularly, we would not have been able to see that all of my hormone levels were steadily declining."
10o59r3,"The too young bit is always funny. As if premature menopause doesn‚Äôt exist.

Shit can hit you at 20 just the same and ignoring symptoms?

Estrogen doesn‚Äòt get below detection threshold in a pre menopause healthy cycle. It does get there in menopause. If estrogen goes below 15pg/ml or whatever the cutoff of the lab, something is ‚Äöoff‚Äò."
10o59r3,Will the endocrinologist check your hormone levels?  Can you find another gyn?
10o59r3,Go see a naturopathic doctor - I did and got my blood tested through her which finally confirmed I was in perimenopause and she helped me figure out the vitamins I needed to get through it!  Never believed in naturopathy medicine until this amazing experience!
10o59r3,"What's your thyroid TSH level? The range is 0.5-5. I felt like crap when it was 4. I went on medication again and I feel a bit better but I don't know what my level is, I have to wait for the test result. 

When I was trying to get pregnant, they wanted it at 2.

Maybe your level is at the top of the range so no one thought to say anything

Ask your OB what level she thinks you should be at"
10o59r3,"my gyn tested me, find a new doctor"
10o59r3,The endocrinologist can test the hormone levels.
10o59r3,Use a telehealth doc who will work with you and drop a lot of info about peri into your current doctors email when you fire her.
10o59r3,"New doctor, for starters. I mean, WTF. I was 40 when I started noticing things were ""off"". See a new gynecologist and don't look back."
10o59r3,She‚Äôs probably getting dinged either by her network admin or by insurance carriers. Im hearing this more and more. Im in menopause‚Äôs and the last two gyn‚Äôs I saw were also hesitant to check mine.
10o59r3,"This really upsets me! The medical system is only for profit! OBGyn need re education on women‚Äôs health! It‚Äôs so aggravating how they treat women and out health.   Let me guess, this doc is in her 30‚Äôs?  You need to go to another physician who specializes in hormone therapy.  You will get the care and attention you need.  Good luck and so sorry you have to deal with this. Just let you know I started peri menopause at 45 yo."
10o59r3,"I started peri at 37 and was told I was the youngest person they‚Äôd seen. I was like bullshit cause they see my sister and she started at 37 a few years before me. I have been through this with doctors. I was told hormone testing can cost more but who cares, do it. They shouldn‚Äôt be denying you. A lot if doctors seem to be very behind with this stuff. I just turned 46. I‚Äôm in menopause. Originally they put me on generic antidepressant to keep the serotonin dips at bay which causes hot flashes. I felt better, I slept like a champ (but lost my dreams), hot flashes and mood swings stopped, but I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not ready to give up my energy (weight gain) & sex drive so I landed on the side of bio identical hormones because, like you, they didn‚Äôt want to put me on them. I have been feeling amazing but that side of the industry is not without fault (do your research, this sub has good articles in the faqs), so now I‚Äôve talked to my Gyno again and for cost reasons I‚Äôll be trying out the more accepted form of basic HRT but I‚Äôm already having some issues so we‚Äôll see how it goes. Good luck."
10o59r3,"Please, please, please seek out a new practitioner.  Bless you, dear one.  üíú"
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm always surprised to see these posts. I found out I was post-menopausal at 41. I know that‚Äôs super early, but it happens!"
10o59r3,"I wish I had helpful advice but I just echo those saying to find a different Dr if possible, otherwise stick to your guns about your concerns. But, sadly, you aren‚Äôt alone!

I had a somewhat similar thing happen. I have a good PCP and I was already post menopausal in my late 30s and we were dealing with things fine. All of a sudden, a couple years back, I got a period. Well, my mom is an ovarian cancer survivor and that‚Äôs how she found out about it, so in I went!

My dr sent me to the OB stat and she couldn‚Äôt stop marveling at how young I was to be possibly starting menopause. I couldn‚Äôt get her to believe me that I was already post menopausal and had started in my mid 30s even tho it was literally in my records. Also I was there to rule out cancer and she kept doing blood tests and sending me to all kinds of specialists to try to figure out why I was in ovarian failure. Lady, I wanted to make sure I‚Äôm not dying. I don‚Äôt care if you can‚Äôt understand my menopause. Ugh. 

(It wasn‚Äôt Cancer thankfully but I did end up having something to remove and ended up having one ovary and tube taken out. THEN she believed me bc she was like well this will def put you towards meno üòµ‚Äçüí´)"
10o59r3,New dr time. I had a trans vaginal scan (for other reasons) they could see that one ovary had packed it in completely and other was on the way. I was 42 then. As far as I‚Äôm aware this is a perfectly normal age to be going through peri menopause.
10o59r3,"I know you saw an endocrinologist but they are notoriously bad at diagnosing and treating hypothyroidism. Most patients suffer with low thyroid symptoms for years before being diagnosed. They are usually offered antidepressants instead. It took 15 years for my diagnosis. Do you have access to your thyroid labs? They are usually online through the patient portal. There's a good chance the endo didn't do actual thyroid tests, just the TSH. That really isn't adequate testing to rule out thyroid disease. If you can find your thyroid labs and post them, I can interpret them for you."
10o59r3,"Please do yourself a favor. Find another doctor. Run, don't walk. Run. If you're in distress it's up to her to help you not dismiss and cast you aside. There IS help, but it's difficult to find it for hormonal/menopausal issues. If you have to, search for a nurse practitioner or a functional medicine doctor. Even anti-aging clinics will point you into the right direction (be careful with the latter). Ob/gyn have never helped me with anything hormonal. Part of the problem is there are ranges doctors go by. If you're in a lower range of normal they dismiss and say it's fine. It isn't fine. There are  (alternative) doctors who understand this and will work to get your system working at optimal, not just barely functioning."
10o59r3, Yup. New doctor. Doctors are not gods
10o59r3,"I agree with LOT of commentators, time for a new doc. I didn't have an ob-gyn since my insurance had changed recently. My PCP was refusing to request hormone tests.  
BEFORE you dump your ob, be firm with them and tell them you will need it NOTED IN YOUR CHART that the are refusing this test that you have requested, and after they add that note, you will need a printed version of your records with them.   
A lot of times they would rather do the test than be called out for something like that. Also by having them not it in your file, if that test could reveal something life-threatening, this can be a basis for malpractice.  
I asked my former PCP to add the note to my file and she requested the testing real quick; little did she know  I was already requesting a new Primary and that primary referred me to my new obgyn who called me as SOON as my results were in and offered me HRT since my numbers were wacky."
10o59r3,Get a new doctor! Ask around in your area for one that will check your hormones.
10o59r3,Maybe try another doctor for new opinion.
10o59r3,"Run, don‚Äôt walk, to another doctor. I‚Äôm 48 and had my last period when I was 44-45. I had LOTS of peri symptoms for a few years before that despite getting a period like clockwork right up until the very last one, and after that all the symptoms that were already there just got way worse. You want a doctor who is on board with what you want and need before it gets to that point!"
10o59r3,"If you have an endocrinologist, why not ask them to test your hormones. Your GP is correct though in saying that your hormones fluctuate and they do fluctuate wildly through the day, so your results would not be what your possible and likely peri menopause would be confirmed on. Your endocrinologist would be the person I would ask for menopausal help though, as they are usually more up to date on treatments for your symptoms."
10o59r3,I saw a functional medicine/ holistic doctor who helped me greatly. Look up someone that specializes in hormone replacement therapy or try another OBGYN that may have better reviews about helping with hormones if possible. Good luck
10o59r3,"Yes, it‚Äôs very frustrating. My period never came back after I stopped breastfeeding and I was 43.  My fertility doc tested my hormones and told me I was at menopause. I moved to another state and   of course they didn‚Äôt believe me. At 45 I had 3 days of spotting so l was referred to a GYN, I had an ultrasound and had NO eggs left. I had no hot flashes or night sweats until I turned 47. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I didn‚Äôt have any symptoms until the last 6 months and new doctor says I need to lose weight and work out. Hello, isn‚Äôt weight gain and insomnia symptoms too."
10o59r3,You'd think women doctors would be compassionate but they're not. Sometimes men doctors aren't any better. Either way find another doctor.  I started peri at 39 and periods stopped at 45/46.
10o59r3,Get a new doctor STAT!!!
10o59r3,Why didn't you talk to the endocrinologist? Surely they had an opinion on your symptoms.
10o59r3,"Ugh, I feel your pain!  I'm 47 and have had insane symptoms, mainly insomnia and skyrocketing anxiety which causes nausea.  So bad that I'm practically in bed for a week a month.  Debilitating.  My doctor did a blood test to ""test my hormones,"" and I am not in full menopause (duh) but ""my levels are off/low.""  But she refuses to prescribe HRT because I get migraines sometimes.  I asked for a referral to an OB/GYN and am going to present my case...maybe that would work for you?"
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm 41 have not had a period in three months. My only symptom has been losing my hair.  I knew I needed to be on estradiol, but my doctor put me on a super low-dose and then decided to take me off while keeping me on testosterone. Outcome, completely bald in the back. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I saw a GYN, my FSH was 118 my Gyn stated I was definitely /possibly heading towards menopause.
Outcome, she started me on estradiol pills, testosterone cream (low-dose), and guess what my hair has recovered tremendously. Thank you Lord."
10o59r3,"I became menopausal in my early 40s and my aunt was 40. It can happen. It's mnd boggling to me that an obgyn doctor wouldn't know that

Edited to add obgyn"
10o59r3,"I found this link on a menopause article. It helps you find doctors in your area that treat it. 

https://portal.menopause.org/NAMS/NAMS/Directory/Menopause-Practitioner.aspx"
10o59r3,"I believe I asked this question month or so ago, but I ended up getting tested while on a 1.5 mg dose of Estradiol. And my Estradiol was so damn high and everything else nonexistent. I felt like you did, and knew shit wasn't right. He didn't want to test me either... so I paid for an online test myself. 

Sent that to my doctor and asked to either switch this medication to something else, or give me medroxyprogesterone. Since I've been on it, I feel so much better. Anxiety is gone, the irritability is gone. 

It worked for me, but not everyone benefits from progesterone."
10o59r3,"Went thru the same argument with my doc at that age. Eventually I changed docs because she wanted to blame my obvious perimenopause symptoms on everything but. This in spite of a family history of early onset in my family and me never being pregnant, both of which would indicate I would be on the early end as well. I finally got her to order the test by telling her I wanted her to note in my chart that I had asked for the test and she was refusing including why. Want to guess the results? If you guessed it absolutely showed perimenopause go get a cookie!

I changed docs a year later. New doc and new gyn are spun up on peri and meno....no more arguments!"
10o59r3,"Testing hormones really mean nothing. I got tested mine and gained nothing from that. Ultrasound gives the real picture, ovarian reserve maybe"
10o59r3,Ask to be referred to an endocrinologist.  They will at least have more information and experience and know where to go from 'okay well your hormones are within normal range'
10o59r3,"get a referral to an endocrinologist or a reproductive endocrinologist or ask your primary care dr. On the one hand, hormone testing really
doesn‚Äôt provide much info unless it is done daily at the same hour for a full cycle. On the other hand, it hurts no one to add a hormone panel to your next blood draw (this is what my primary care did for me and it did show low estrogen but it was also the day before period when E is dropping so it wasn‚Äôt super helpful)."
10o59r3,I just heard on a health podcast about a 30 day test called rhythm.  It tests you over an entire menstrual cycle using just saliva.  You test every two days (so 15 tests total).  Ask your doctor if something like that would be more ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù to them.
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm in the US! Thank you!

My symptoms ‚Ä¶.Breast tenderness -extreme due to fibrocystic breast disease. Insomnia for three years. Loss of sex drive. Irritability. Rage. Crying everyday. I‚Äôm not social anymore, I never leave my house. Bloating and constipation - just had a colonoscopy and nothing if concern there. Dry skin. Hot flushes -one a few. Depression. Anxiety. Brain fog. Panic attacks. 

I have done significant testing last year ruling lots of stuff out. 

I just want her to help instead of sending me to other doctors to rule things out. I‚Äôve been to at least 10 other specialists last year. Had so many procedures and testing. Nothing is found. I believe it‚Äôs time for obGYN to do her job."
10o59r3,"Wow. That‚Äôs realy good to hear . Estriol diminished most of my symptoms of menopause . I started on my testosterone today. I have some headaches . I‚Äôm applying 0.5 ml, estradiol 100mg. Will headaches go away with time or do I have to speak to my gyno again ? Thanks"
10o59r3,"I had so many of the same symptoms. I found a doctor who was more ‚Äúwellness‚Äù based. Who didn‚Äôt just take into account the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù and whether I was in range or not, but looked at ME as the patient and what I was feeling. She also explained the range settings on blood draw results as being an F student if you were super low on the scale but still in ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù and being an A student if your numbers were better. Who wants to be an F student, she says. If she can make my numbers better, she will. So I had a testosterone pellet (Biote) implanted. So far I have more energy and my libido is through the roof. If your doctor will not listen, I would find a new one or check into a naturopath.  I‚Äôm almost a month post implantation, and my symptoms should only keep improving."
10o59r3,She is a moron. I told her my mom went into menopause at 47. She said that doesn‚Äôt mean much for me. Everyone is different.
10o59r3,So your doc was testing for menopause?
10o59r3,Thank I will. Part of me wants testing because I think my estrogen is too high and it‚Äôs causing multiple cysts throughout my body. It scares me and I thought maybe if I at least knew my levels I could get the right help
10o59r3,"Yes, that is the most concerning part!"
10o59r3,"Yea, my symptoms started in my 30s and I had no clue what I was going through!  My last period was at 43.  It didn‚Äôt all click until my periods stopped."
10o59r3,"It even happens to those of us without uteruses, too [but, I did USED to have one]. üòâ"
10o59r3,I‚Äôm ok if she won‚Äôt test me but she isn‚Äôt willing to give me treatment either. I‚Äôm kind of stuck
10o59r3,Thanks. I‚Äôll try that approach
10o59r3,"Lol! Maybe I will. At the rate I‚Äôm going, it won‚Äôt be a lie"
10o59r3,I‚Äôm in NY so it‚Äôs a no go for that. I appreciate it.
10o59r3,I would love to know that too.
10o59r3,"There is no need for hormone testing, the issue is that we need to demand more for our **symptoms** and not be brushed off with ""you're too young"", or ""it's normal aging"".  Also everyone should demand a bone density scan around the age of 50, not 65 which is the common recommendation from doctors (and by then it's too late)."
10o59r3,"Yes it'd DrMaryClair on Instagram. Same with drjengunter.  When I turned 50 I asked my gyno if there would be some type of test to see if I needed HRT and she said it's prescribed based on symptoms. Hormonal testing is only indicated for women trying to conceive. 

OP, what kind of symptoms are you having?"
10o59r3,"Yeah I agree. I asking for help. It doesn‚Äôt have to be hormone testing, but she isn‚Äôt doing anything. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm more upset about."
10o59r3,"I habe to disagree, 49 here and by OBGYN tested me in October. My levels are no where near menopause yet. The only reason that I wanted to know is because I was hospitalized in July with a DVT and PE to both lungs and I have to take blood thinners now and I was very worried about having a menstrual cycle. So, I wanted to see how close I was to maybe not having to worry about it. Well since, my periods are flooding. It‚Äôs awful for the first 3 days."
10o59r3,"I think this there is no test you can get for peri is false, and I'm tired of hearing it repeated.  Tests MAY not show anything and you can STILL be in peri.  So they don't provide a definitive ""No""

But tests often DO show something!!!  High FSH for one, maybe dropping estrogen, I had all that while still bleeding (but extremely symptomatic) and so yes tests can not give a definitive ""No"" but they can give a ""Yes"".  But how can you know from those tests it's peri and not full menopause?  You can't from the tests (except estrogen then was not in the full meno levels, so it would hint at that).  But if you  have a uterus and are still bleeding, and aren't on hormones (yet), then it's peri because having periods."
10o59r3,"Nah the test works. It just won‚Äòt show ‚Äötoo low‚Äò estrogen in all cases of peri and full menopause.

If your estrogen is extremely low, something is wrong and it needs to be looked at, and osteoporosis risk happens even if you don‚Äòt experience hotf√∂ashes etc when estrogen is that low.


It‚Äòs just that you can get the full spectrum of symptoms, despite the test still showing ‚Äöebough estrogen‚Äò because you are still having cyclic estrogen levels and just happened to test at the peak, or the estrogen levels are too low for your body specifically."
10o59r3,Interesting. Thank you
10o59r3,"Also, I know nothing about this company, but are you in a position to pay out of pocket for blood work?  https://www.healthlabs.com/female-hormone-tests 

Or there might be other options that are similar.  I know LabCorp has a self-order option now for some of their tests."
10o59r3,"Also healthy tsh/t3/t4 vary quite a bit between individuals. The reference values are quite wide, and that‚Äòs by just taking a population of people without symptoms.‚Äò

So a borderline elevated tsh and borderline low t3/4 can already cause hairloss, weight gain etc in one person, but for someone else it is perfectly fine.


As with HRT, you can really dose on estrogen blood levels, you gotta dose by symptoms, because the correct level of estrogen for woman A can be like 4 times that of woman B."
10o59r3,"Just because you don‚Äòt always gain information doesn‚Äòt mean it‚Äòs useful.


Testing Estrogen and LSH works, but it can only tell you that you are in menopause when estrogen is very low and lsh very high.

For all other levels of estrogen and lsh it can neither say whether those are premenopausal or menopausal levels. Because none of us got our personal reference values taken in our thirties.

So yea if estrogen isn‚Äòt low enough. The test will be inconclusive. But if it is low enough, the test is very conclusive for ovarian insufficiency at least and thus menopause for whatever reason."
10o59r3,"That‚Äôs all perimenopause and HRT will make you feel so much better, protect your heart and bones and prevent dementia. Find a doc on the NAMS list today and make an appt. Best of luck to you. Sorry your doctors are failing you. Most of us have been failed by the medical community- keep fighting for adequate care"
10o59r3,"I had most of that too and the 3 primary care doctors I saw told me it was nothing. I had also gained 40 pounds. The sleep deprivation was insane. I want to know how the hell they thought it was okay to just allow me to keep having almost no sleep for 2 years. At minimum they should have tried to heal that. 

I googled HRT clinic, went there. I sleep EVERY night since I started in August. My anxiety is almost non existent and my sex life is the best it‚Äôs ever been. I hold a fulltime job, which maybe sounds silly to some, but before HRT I was literally disabled by my mental health. I want to punch those other doctors.

I‚Äôm 40"
10o59r3,"I had all of those at 35 and it ended up being mold toxicity. All my labs came back normal and yet I had all these blaring instances of hormonal imbalances. 

I know it‚Äôs probably not the case for you but just thought I‚Äôd share my experience in the small instance you get your hormones tested and it comes back normal!  It could be something like mold mycotoxins that mimic hormones and throw you off.

I found out my issue by having my urine tested for mycotoxins.

I also had irregular/heavier than normal periods, pms when I never had it before, hair loss, and hormonal acne‚Ä¶all out of the blue. An ovarian tumor appeared at the same time and my doctor says it may also be connected with the mycotoxins/imitation hormones."
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm sorry, I had a similar experience. Incredibly frustrating- my doctor (young and a woman too!) was incredibly dismissive of my concerns. She wouldn‚Äôt prescribe the pill because I use blood pressure medication to control borderline high blood pressure. 
I got the pill from alldaychemist.com (no prescription needed, it‚Äôs a reliable pharmacy that ships from India). I used to get the pill over the counter from a Costco when I lived part time in Cabo, so that‚Äôs definitely an easy option. 
I finally found a Dr (not an OBGYN) who was semi retired and started a wellness practice. He did use both symptoms and blood tests to diagnose me.  My hormone levels were super low, he put me on an estrogen cream (a few days a week, vaginal), progesterone (nightly oral), and low dose testosterone cream (daily, cream).  I was also anemic and he put me on iron.  

The HRT has been life changing for me! All of the symptoms you list were eliminated or reduced in weeks of starting hormones.  I‚Äôm still angry that NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT in peri, but this sub has shown me that‚Äôs a pretty common experience.  
Good luck!"
10o59r3,"Ugh. I feel this so much. Let‚Äôs just do more tests! I‚Äôm tired of more tests. Can we discuss peri, please?"
10o59r3,Try some otc progesterone cream to see if it helps any symptoms. King veggie I was rxed hormones I used Progesto-life and I sleep like a freaking baby when I used it. I know people on here say the creams don‚Äôt help but I know several people who had symptoms lessen on it including sleep issues and hot flashes.
10o59r3,"Rage and brain fog ... Yup! 

I am not sure if others have mentioned this, but you can DIY order blood tests for yourself online. Then get HRT through an online doctor."
10o59r3,"Not a help for everything, but I have fibrocystic breasts also and have had good luck taking an iodine supplement for the pain (it's like someone pressing burning cigarettes into certain spots in my breasts if I don't take it regularly). I have had several mammograms so I'm sure it isn't something worse. When I take them, I get a bit of general tenderness during parts of my cycle but not the constant searing pain from before."
10o59r3,"You don‚Äôt want hormones anyway. The risks are too high at this point. You can be peri menopausal for at least ten years. You can treat the symptoms with other meds but, it didn‚Äôt matter if she tested the hormones. Maybe supplements can help. Anti depressants, maybe it‚Äôs PCOS. It‚Äôs literally how the body ages. Idk, find some older friends who have been through all this and look at dietary and exercise changes. It really really really sucks. Source: I‚Äôm old"
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm not familiar with ‚ÄúEstriol‚Äù- is it an estrogen only replacement?  My Dr said I have to have progesterone with estrogen, although progesterone only is ok. 
I use testosterone too and it‚Äôs helped my energy.  I don‚Äôt know if migraines are hormone related. Make sure you‚Äôre drinking enough water"
10o59r3,"As someone with lifelong medical problems, I have switched doctors several times for this kind of attitude. There are docs out there who will listen to you and treat you like a partner in your care. You know your own body and what‚Äôs not normal for you, and a doctor should respect that. 

I also had a GYN who said I was too young for peri around the same age as you. I wasn‚Äôt having many symptoms other than irregular cycle and light flow, so I didn‚Äôt pursue it with another doctor since I wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. I was right about the cause, though, and was in full menopause by around 48."
10o59r3,"Noooo, menopause strongly tracks along genetics, just like most everything else in biology. Your doc sounds terrible :("
10o59r3,I read the age of your mother is a good predictor.
10o59r3,There is no test for menopause.
10o59r3,"There are many types of estrogen in your body. Check out Dr. Jen Gunter -- she gives the best breakdown re estrogen out there. A referral to endocrinologist would get you the info you need if you think it is systemic. Cysts are not caused by estrogen alone, and depending on type and location of cysts they are crazy common. 

End of day, you need a doc that listens to your concerns but you also need to dig into the research yourself in this patriarchical medical world!!"
10o59r3,"Hi OP :-). I hope you‚Äôre doing well!

I wanted to post a bit more in here about the value of reading the wiki for this group. You may have already read it, but others seeing these posts might not.  There is a lot of well-intentioned but misleading/inaccurate information being given in these comments. 

Look for the section in the Wiki under ‚ÄúNavigating your appointment‚Äù. In there is a section that starts with this, bolded:  ‚ÄúThere is no blood test that is perfectly reliable to diagnose menopause.‚Äù

It goes on to say (heavily paraphrased by me) that during menopause our hormone levels fluctuate wildly. Getting a test at one point in time gives you no information at all that is useful. Maybe you happened to get the test at a high peak of a hormone. Or a low valley. It may tell you where you were at that day, but it tells you nothing about the rest of the month. And every day, and month, will be very different as you travel through menopause.


This is me talking now. 
I‚Äôve found that my symptoms are my key! Learn how to manage the symptoms. Some symptoms are relieved by hormones. Some aren‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt take hormones, so I had to find other remedies. And I‚Äôve found several! 

It is frustrating and it takes time to learn and explore what works for you. It is horrible that better information isn‚Äôt available. Keep asking questions, keep looking. And be wise about paying attention to well-researched versus anecdotal information. 

I wish you well!

ü¶ãü¶ã"
10o59r3,"So I got my primary care to test my progesterone, it came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when I went to the HRT clinic they tested and I didn‚Äôt even make the scale. They use quest labs so I knew it wasn‚Äôt like they made it up. I know this group has since taught me testing can‚Äôt find it because it‚Äôs so variable, but I thank god that the test showed me that day that I was right and I had no progesterone at some times. Progesterone saved my life. If I hadn‚Äôt seen it on that test I may not have continued with HRT. It was incredibly validating to see the numbers on the test. Same for testosterone, I was in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range but then I found out normal and optimal are not the same. I‚Äôm on testosterone now and omg I can just orgasm like all the time, wtf? It‚Äôs amazing."
10o59r3,"My menopause doctor tests. Otherwise how else are we going to know what we need and how much and if we even need it? If you are still cycling it has to be on a certain day of the month, because there are different normal ranges for different phases of the month. Get a new doctor! Gynos are the most useless ones."
10o59r3,"It‚Äôs an easy blood test- personally I‚Äôm very glad I had my hormone levels tested.  I started on HRT after that and it‚Äôs been so helpful. 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a downside to getting hormone levels checked.  The results aren‚Äôt the end all be all answer to everything but they are a data point."
10o59r3,"You are never going to know if your estrogen is too high unless you get a blood test. But if you are in peri and not on HRT, it won‚Äôt be too high, low if anything."
10o59r3,Ah yes I did intend my comment to be inclusive of this too but upon reading see it needs an update.
10o59r3,Is this seriously the only doctor you can see? Do you see the same doctor every time?
10o59r3,Good luck!
10o59r3,"If you live in New York, couldn‚Äôt you drive to a neighboring state? I live in California so it takes six hours to drive out of the state, and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs some you east coasters do often."
10o59r3,"Then it‚Äôs time to find another doctor, or be so damn insistent your doc gives in just to shut you up."
10o59r3,Couldn‚Äôt agree more ‚ò∫Ô∏è
10o59r3,"Oh boy. Here ya go. Breast tenderness -extreme due to fibrocystic breast disease. Insomnia for three years. Loss of sex drive. Irritability. Rage. Crying everyday. I‚Äôm not social anymore, I never leave my house. Bloating and constipation - just had a colonoscopy and nothing if concern there. Dry skin. Hot flushes -one a few. Depression. Anxiety. Brain fog. Panic attacks. 

I have done significant testing last year ruling lots of stuff out."
10o59r3,"Let's be clear here...using hormonal tests **to diagnose** perimenopause for someone who is within the age range is not recommended.  In fact doctors who insist on this test in an attempt to diagnose peri, are not reputable or don't know what they are doing.  

Noted in our Wiki, and supported by Menopause Societies around the world, along with Dr. Jen Gunter (author of *The Menopause Manifesto*):

>There is no blood test that is perfectly reliable to diagnose menopause. However many doctors will rely on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool, but this test does not provide a definitive diagnosis. While it might be nice to know what your hormone levels are, they have no real bearing on anything because hormones are in a constant state of flux during peri/menopause where hormones wildly fluctuate. Therefore that one hormonal blood test at one point in time is just that...what they were doing on that day, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month.

**The outcome of this test can result in the following....which is a huge disservice to women**

1. Results indicate **normal levels**. This gives doctors licence to dismiss anything else you have to say about your symptoms, claiming 'you cannot be in peri because your FSH is normal'.  

2. Results indicate **post-menopausal levels**.  This can come as a complete shock for many to realize they are no longer in child-bearing years, and have already made the transition without even knowing! It causes unnecessary stress and sadness, mourning for a sudden loss of their youth.

**THE ONLY TIME FSH TESTING IS BENEFICIAL**...for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause), then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming this. 

Also for younger women (in their 20s) who haven't had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at 'menopausal' levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure (POF)."
10o59r3,"Hormones aren't for everyone. I can't take them because of breast cancer. And that's not all perimenopause. That could be a lot of things,  diagnosing people and then suggesting a treatment on reddit really isn't a great idea. Especially something so broad, symptom wise."
10o59r3,"I don‚Äôt want to derail the OP‚Äôs topic, but did you get that testing done from a doctor or through an online service, and what did you do with the results? Was there some treatment or was there a search to find a source of mold in your home, or both?"
10o59r3,Unless you live in NY.
10o59r3,"The risks are generally NOT HIGH from using HRT. That is an outdated opinion; if you look at recent research using HRT it is actually beneficial for a lot of women and can help lower cardiovascular risks and prevent bone loss. 

OP- please see the resources on the wiki here and don‚Äôt feel like you have to suffer.  A lot of medical issues/aging are ‚Äúnatural‚Äù- we still treat them to improve quality of life and longevity."
10o59r3,"Estradiol is estrogen only . But if you have uterus still you will  need to take both oestrogen and progesterone .  But also good to check your estrogen levels before you start . It has been a life changer . I fell like a human again . I drink lots of water . One of the side effects of testestron is headaches and nausea . Only headaches is what I have but will wait for two more weeks and see if I get better .
 Many many thanks üôè"
10o59r3,Estriol is one of the 3 human female estrogen hormones. The other two are estrone and estradiol. Estriol is easier to find as an OTC cream because it is weaker and thought less likely to cause adverse effects.
10o59r3,I had a female doctor tell me I was too young to be in PERImenopause at 47 yo. I was fully through menopause by 51 yo. WTH is wrong with these doctors?
10o59r3,"Exactly this. My mom at 39, aunt at 42, and me at 45. Genetics are definitely predictive for menopause."
10o59r3,"Not necessarily, researchers are finding it may have more to do with environment and lifestyle.  Like weight, smokers, etc can contribute to early menopause.  Also from a genetic perspective, it's more in line with sibling (sisters) rather than aunts/mothers/grandmothers, again because of the shared environment of growing up together."
10o59r3,Yea she‚Äôs the worst
10o59r3,There is a blood test: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) that can be used to confirm menopause.
10o59r3,So the test is??
10o59r3,Thank you‚Äô I appreciate your information
10o59r3,">how else are we going to know what we need and how much and if we even need it?

By symptoms. Symptoms tell us if we need MHT/HRT and whether or not they are working."
10o59r3,I saw 3 different doctors and all of them told me it was all in my head. So it‚Äôs not as easy as asking a doctor. I was also waited 6-7 months between doctors because I live rural and that was the wait to see a new one. I ended up going to a HRT clinic(2 hours away) and I did have my hormones tested (and they test them every 3 months)
10o59r3,Thank you!
10o59r3,"Did your doctor mention perimenopause or offer any symptom relief? If not, I would find someone new. If you can swing it financially, look into an online provider like Evernow or Alloy. Those are US only I think but they may have similar for other countries. 

There's also an app someone recommended called Balance, it's based. It allows you to track symptoms in a way that you can print out a report to being to your doctor appt. It also has a lot of information, research, and an online forum.  Using it has given me insight into the relationship between some of my symptoms, sleep, activity level, and food intake, and has inspired me to make some positive changes."
10o59r3,"Emphasis the hot flashes and if you have them, night sweats. Honestly- it‚Äôs unfortunate but the other symptoms are written off by some doctors as being in your head or caused by other things.  

Hot flashes and night sweats seem like the only symptoms most doctors consider when assessing peri.  It‚Äôs ridiculous but true."
10o59r3,I had all of those symptoms from low estrogen. The Climara estradiol patch gave me relief.
10o59r3,"So they are useful is what you are saying? Not testing because they could ‚Äösurprise‚Äò you with the knowledge that you are indeed post menopausal (or in premature menopause/ovarian insufficiency) doesn‚Äòt seem like a good reason not to test to me?

That‚Äòs stuff I would want to know. If someone doesn‚Äòt want to know, they just don‚Äòt need to ask for tests.



Doctors will dismiss you 4 out of 5 times anyway, irrespective of tests. I don‚Äòt think asking for a test is gonna change that. If the follow the science, a ‚Äönormal‚Äò test would simply be inconclusive and not prove of absence of perimenopause.




I‚Äòd think the problem would be medical professionals ignoring that a test where FSH and E2 are within normal ranges is inconclusive, and not proof that this isn‚Äôt perimenopause.





That‚Äôs like saying a covid rapid test is useless, because you can still be infected with a negative test."
10o59r3,I am curious about this too
10o59r3,"I feel the same way bc I‚Äôm in all these different groups from my years of trying to find out what was wrong with me, and I hate being that person that‚Äôs always like, ‚ÄúCheck for mold!‚Äù But also if someone had done that for me six years ago I could have saved so much time‚Ä¶

I got tested through a D.O. near me who specializes in mold. It‚Äôs called a mycotoxin panel. I‚Äôm now going through hyperbaric oxygen therapy which detoxes everything that‚Äôs buried deep in your tissues and helps repair the damage that has been done throughout the body. I‚Äôm about 80 hours in and finally starting to feel like myself.

My main symptoms were pelvic pain, brain fog, and fatigue along with sudden eye, sinus, reflux, and hormonal issues. Other issues were neurological/tingling type feelings and arthritis out of nowhere. 

In case this helps one person out there I wanted to share!"
10o59r3,Some doctors treat patients as if we all function the way the medical textbooks say we should. They also don‚Äôt trust patients to know anything. I know enough now to run from any doctor who doesn‚Äôt see me as an individual
10o59r3,"Similar issues here. I don‚Äôt get it- doctors know there‚Äôs a range of average age for menopause, they often seem to decide women are too young though."
10o59r3,"I think some doctors think of perimenopause as the end stage immediately prior to menopause. So the last year or 2. And I was recently looking into medical literature, and even between that, some describe it as much shorter periods of time in a two stage process. IDK, maybe it is, and maybe WE are using it wrong, but something is going on in my body that is different than it always was and its a process that has been going on for a number of years. So unless I get into menopause in the next year, I have gone way past the timeframe they claim."
10o59r3,"Again, one capture won't confirm this, it needs to be a series of consistent tests."
10o59r3,"There is no test..menopause is **confirmed** when someone is within menopause age-range and periods have stopped for 12 months.  Perimenopause is confirmed by **symptoms**, and ruling out those symptoms as being due to something.  Please read our [Menopause Wiki.](/r/Menopause/wiki/index#wiki_symptoms)"
10o59r3,"I‚Äôm in Oregon as well‚Äîand definitely not rural‚Äîand I, too, have had three [maybe 4?] different doctors essentially scratch their head, say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too healthy / young, let‚Äôs do a full blood panel.‚Äù Which, sure, is great to do every few years, but, things always come back as super ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Same for my hormone labs, which I had to advocate for, 2x over the past three years now ‚Ä¶ And it wasn‚Äôt until pretty recently I learned that that wasn‚Äôt a good diagnostic tool. 

I‚Äôm almost 43, I take meticulous care of myself, and it has STILL been an uphill battle. I have the added bonus of having a history of depression + anxiety, which I have been on SSRIs for for years, so those two things are always the culprit. üôÑ

It really feels like we can‚Äôt win. So many GPs+ OBGYN‚Äôs who act dumbfounded by a forty-something old woman being like, ‚ÄúSomething is NOT okay with me + I need your help.‚Äù 

IT ISN‚ÄôT ROCKET SCIENCE."
10o59r3,What kind of test? What are they looking for?
10o59r3,"Thank you! I‚Äôm goi g to get that app asap 

To be honest the doctor pretty much said she doesn‚Äôt believe in perimenopause and therefore referred me to all the other doctor to rule stuff out. She is very unwilling to believe me."
10o59r3,"Thet are not useful for anyone in perimenopause or menopause, aka anyone in this sub."
10o59r3,"I know for sure I worked in a moldy office, and now with my son testing positive I know we‚Äôve lived in it at some point. Soon I will test our current house just to make sure we‚Äôre good here, but I‚Äôm 99% this all came from us living in moldy military housing, and from when I worked on a base."
10o59r3,So where is the mold that affected you? Did you remediate it?
10o59r3,she could also possibly have a hormonal imbalance that could be affecting the symptoms which can be tested.
10o59r3,"Oh yes, they told me I was just depressed multiple times. I have mental health diagnosis and been in therapy for 10 years and it has never been depression. 
The HRT clinic I was going to was in Portland/Tigard, but my doctor there recently moved and I am following her to Newberg where her husband and her have opened their own practice. I live on the North Coast."
10o59r3,"Gosh they tested quite a few things. The test showed I had no progesterone, low testosterone, estrogen was good. It showed I was just borderline hypo thyroid, there was a bunch of other things on there. My iron was abysmal. I did pay extra to test my Vit D so that wasn‚Äôt included, I asked for it. It covered quite a bit, not just hormone stuff. 
She did tell me the tests don‚Äôt show the whole picture and that subsequent tests aren‚Äôt for diagnoses just monitoring."
10o59r3,"I understand when doctors want to rule things out. But she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô in perimenopause? WHAT!?! Definitely time for a new doctor. Kinda curious if she‚Äòs a younger doctor, or perhaps an older one who is unwilling to get on board with actually treating the horrid symptoms of perimenopause and maybe one who needs to retire already! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre being dismissed by her."
10o59r3,"Oof, time to find someone new! If you have insta, look for drjengunter and drmaryclaire - wealth of information between the two."
10o59r3,"Ugh, such a challenge! I‚Äôve been to several doctors all having different approaches that conflict and symptoms have not improved very much. Just started with MIDI Health last week and they take insurance, it‚Äôs virtual and I‚Äôm already seeing major improvement. She added estrogen patches, had me drop testosterone and keep taking progesterone. Really feels like I‚Äôm finally on the right track. Check them out, they are not yet available in every state. Oh, and they leverage FDA approved prescriptions that you can use insurance for. They are not a place with all the high cost fees every month, etc."
10o59r3,">	doctor pretty much said she doesn‚Äôt believe in perimenopause

I can't wait for her to be hit with a truckload of symptoms someday. And I don't feel bad about wishing ill for her."
10o59r3,"But they are? The can give definitive proof of menopause in some cases of menopause. If they don‚Äòt give prove, you are exactly in the same position as without the test.

I just don‚Äòt get why that‚Äòs not useful? Just because the test cannot find all occurrences of menopause (or perimenopause) doesn‚Äòt stop it from being useful.


Additionally if estrogen levels around ovulation were tested once a year, you would notice a drastic dip in levels over time. Even if normal levels between women differ."
10o59r3,"It was most likely in one of the military houses we‚Äôve lived in the past decade. (We‚Äôve moved a lot.) One of the bases overseas handed us a packet on mold and asbestos when we moved in like, ‚Äúheads up you‚Äôre living in poison- sucks to be you.‚Äù So I‚Äôm thinking it was that house. I also definitely worked under a moldy ceiling on a different base prior to that. My family is symptomless but I have been very sick for years now‚Ä¶ probably because I got a double dose of exposure."
10o59r3,"Oh! Newberg is only a 30ish min drive for me. What‚Äôs her new practice called? 

I have been able to better manage my symptoms, for the time being, through adjusting my SSRI to a much more appropriate level for anxiety management [uhm, I though it was a good idea to lower my dose down slowly, but by a good amount, during the pandemic? NOT my smartest move] AND I began working with a psychiatrist AND a therapist early last year, and I stopped drinking all alcohol, and I practiced way more mindfulness + meditation. AND I make sure I exercise 4+ times a week. 

And ‚Ä¶ Even that wasn‚Äôt enough to fully remedy my insomnia, sleep anxiety, life anxiety + suddenly much more unpredictable hormone fluctuations. Adding in acupuncture with a talented acupuncturist who specializes in women‚Äôs hormonal health has helped me stabilize well enough for now, but I‚Äôd be fooling myself to think I have it all figured out + it‚Äôs smooth sailing now. I KNOW this is just the beginning! 

So all o‚Äô that to say, I do very much foresee hormonal therapy in my future. A referral would be amazing!"
10o59r3,I guess that‚Äôs private healthcare? That kind of thing isn‚Äôt available on the NHS.
10o59r3,Thank you! I appreciate it!
10o59r3,It can have long-lasting effects. Ugh!
10o59r3,"
My anxiety is almost completely gone now. I had terrible sleep for two years (I thought it was going to kill me, not being able to sleep) I have slept every night since starting progesterone. My moods stabilized (for the most part, I am human lol). I no longer feel like living is painful. I also do a testosterone pellet, which I am sure is doing stuff I don‚Äôt notice but it also makes me have insane off the charts orgasms. She warned me that some women complain about the sex drive going up, but I LOVE it."
10o59r3,"Oh yes, I private pay. My regular American health insurance doctors didn‚Äôt want to help me at all."
10o59r3,"Thank you! I will keep this name in my back pocket. 

Insomnia + anxiety are 100% my knee-jerk physiological reactions to hormonal shifts / dips‚Äîliterally, it has happened three times in my life, all in hormonally-related circumstances: postpartum with my second kid, then post-hysterectomy three years later [kept my ovaries, but I had a suspicious uterine fibroid] + then three MORE years later, last year, in 2022. Like, the correlation of hormones to these debilitating episodes could. not. be. more. obvious. 

And yet ‚Ä¶ And yet. 

[I will say, pellets seem to be controversial on here + through medical sources like Dr. Jen Gunter, but that‚Äôs neither here nor there for me. I‚Äôm interested in the transdermal estrogen + potentially micro used oral progesterone. ‚ò∫Ô∏è]"
10o59r3,"Do you think they‚Äôre sending you for unnecessary tests and charging you for it? In the U.K. they offer HRT because it‚Äôs cheap and easy, and if it doesn‚Äôt work they start more expensive options."
10o59r3,"If you aren‚Äôt interested in pellets I would go through a primary care or even zoom, I have heard progesterone is cheap and I am mainly paying for testosterone. 

I will have a look around this subreddit. I am new here and haven‚Äôt seen much about the pellets. I‚Äôve been thinking to switching to injections but I‚Äôm already on Semaglutide and I don‚Äôt really want to stick myself more than once a week."
10o59r3,"I pay one price for the labs+meds+doctor access and it‚Äôs less than I paid to see the doctor on my regular insurance. The only lab I pay extra for is when I want to check my Vit D and that‚Äôs $40. Since I live in northern Oregon(similar climate to the UK) I do like to occasionally get that checked, even though every other doctor would not order the lab for me because ‚Äúeveryone here is deficient, just take a supplement‚Äù 

Do they do testosterone pellets over there?"
113030j,Welcome! Read the Wiki if you haven‚Äôt yet. You‚Äôll find this is a very supportive sub. üòä
113030j,"Hello, dear one!  Please consider talking with your practitioner about vitamin levels, especially B & D.  A thyroid & hemoglobin check.  This info has been a game changer in my post-hysterectomy & then menopause life.  Be well!!!üíú"
10shrwt,I was like you for over a year until very recently tried Isolate pure CBD (no THC) gummies. Game changer.
10shrwt,"I am so sorry. I‚Äôve really appreciated the Calm app and their sleep stories and meditations. When I‚Äôm in your shoes (or PJs, lol) I will do a ‚Äúback to sleep‚Äù meditation and focus on the fact that I am resting, regardless of whether or not I‚Äôm asleep."
10shrwt,currently 3:55 AM and I hate it too
10shrwt,I slept until 0430!!! üòÅ
10shrwt,"I have gotten up at 2-3AM for years now. I finally got a remote job that lets me work those hours so I roll with it and get done by 10. :)

I use bluetooth eye blinders playing the 'sleep' spotify playlist to KEEP me asleep until at least 2AM."
10shrwt,Up too‚Ä¶
10shrwt,Same
10shrwt,"My eyes popped open and my brain started yammering at 5:02. I just decided to go with it, I have a really busy morning anyway. I‚Äôll be garbage by 1 pm but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
10shrwt,"Same here.  I saw a post yesterday that said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre up at 3-5 am you are at the start of a spiritual journey‚Äù.  Well it was 3 am when I saw it and being cranky and menopausal all i could think was ‚Äúoh efff that, the only journey I‚Äôm on is to the toilet to pee again‚Äù"
10shrwt,"1 a.m. today, so effing tired."
10shrwt,"3:33 am today for me‚Ä¶I am in the same club, but as all of us would agree, not a fan of the reasons we are ‚Äúauto-enrolled‚Äù in this specific club ‚òπÔ∏è"
10shrwt,I eat a gummy melatonin when that happens and fall back asleep in minutes. Just a 3mg melatonin gummy will give me 3 more hours of sleep
10shrwt,"I‚Äôve gotten amazing relief from Medterra brand full spectrum gummies. My wake ups are definitely anxiety driven and it helps with that. I still wake up to go to the bathroom or because my husband rolls around in the bed like a marlin but I can go back to sleep at least. I‚Äôm sorry you are suffering, I was too before I started taking these every night."
10shrwt,For me 3am is usually my bedtime because I cannot fall asleep.
10shrwt,I was still up at my 3 am. Sorry I missed you ‚ù§Ô∏è
10shrwt,Why is it always 3am?!!
10shrwt,I agree! It was 3:30 for me this morning. üòï
10shrwt,Oh I started up way too late and was up at 4 am instead of the normal 3. Some of my retired neighbors are also up that time of night because I see their lights on.
10shrwt,"I was up too!

Bing rip and back to sleep. :)"
10shrwt,Ugh why is it 3 am thats more popular?
10shrwt,Yoga nidra. Free on youtube
10shrwt,"Reading this ar 3am. Yea, happy returns. Every night. Wheeee. Shame we can‚Äôt chat on Discord."
10shrwt,"I have no trouble falling asleep, but I wake up after 4 hours even after taking a max dose of Trazodone, which I‚Äôm trying this week for the first time. Does the pure CBD help you stay asleep?"
10shrwt,I started taking CBD gummies with no THC for sleep about 10 days ago and they really do seem to help. I'm now routinely sleeping from around midnight to 6am uninterrupted. Quite often I can go back to sleep after waking at 6 for another hour or so. It's really helped. I've just got to find a cheaper brand. The ones I'm taking are around $70 for 30 gummies and I take 2 a night!
10shrwt,Funny I just tried that for the first time last night and I slept the whole night through!! Total game changer !!
10shrwt,"CBD didn‚Äôt do anything for me, but Delta 8 gummies work sometimes. I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting on my state to legalize weed in the next year or two so I can try edibles and see if they help. In the meantime I just bought a book about using cognitive behavior therapy to help insomnia, I don‚Äôt have much hope in it but if it helps I‚Äôll post about it."
10shrwt,Thanks for reminding me of the Calm app! Hadn‚Äôt thought about trying it for the witching-hour wakeups. But I definitely will.
10shrwt,"Hey, fellow West Coaster. Sucks to be us right now!"
10shrwt,"Hey, that‚Äôs an accomplishment! :-D"
10shrwt,Welcome to the zombie zoo. ;-)
10shrwt,So sorry.
10shrwt,"TBH, I‚Äôd kill for a 5 am wake-up at this point. I hope that‚Äôs the worst of it for you!"
10shrwt,"Oh, man. I‚Äôm so sorry."
10shrwt,If only we could decline enrollment! üòÇ
10shrwt,"Doesn‚Äôt do a thing for me, unfortunately. Other than I remember my dreams when I use it, which is kinda fun because I *never* remember dreaming otherwise and haven‚Äôt for decades."
10shrwt,"‚ÄúLike a marlin‚Äù made me laugh, so thanks for that! My hubby‚Äôs a thrasher, too, which absolutely does not help!"
10shrwt,"Well, that sucks. Especially if you‚Äôre working. (I no longer am, which makes me feel really lucky compared to a lot of others in this menopause boat!)"
10shrwt,"I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having sleep problems, too. May the insomnia devils forget about you tonight!"
10shrwt,It‚Äôs always four hours after I go to sleep for me.
10shrwt,"At least we retired folks can get away with being zombies a little more easily than those who are still working. If that includes you, deepest sympathies! It‚Äôs gotta be *so hard*."
10shrwt,"If I‚Äôm understanding it correctly, menopause dis-regulates body temperature cycles (circadian rhythms). Menopausal women‚Äôs temperature often peaks in the wee hours because of a natural flush of hormones that occurs while, typically, human bodies reach their coolest temperature about two hours before we wake up. So our circadian rhythms are all messed up, often exacerbated by uncomfortable hot flashes."
10shrwt,"I have not problem going to sleep either. It's the waking up between 2-5am. yes, it helps me sleep as it takes a few hours to work and lasts for up to 6-8 hours. I now wake up once maybe and fall right back to sleep vs tossing for hours. I take it right before I go to bed. Even when I now wake up once and go back to sleep, I feel fully rested unlike before when I wake up for good.  Every one is different. I'm taking 20mgs and will up to 30 when my new online order arrives."
10shrwt,"Trazodone only helps me to sleep for four hours as well. I take HRT which helps, but also ashwaganda, Magesium L Threonate, glycine."
10shrwt,"Trazodone hack: Take a lesser dose at bedtime [maybe 75 mg instead of 100 or 150? What even is the max dose?] + then! When you wake up at 3 am‚Äîyou take another 25 mg to 50 mg. 

That, plus focusing on my breathing / meditation tactics [instead of encouraging my kind to race], works for me 75/80 percent of the time! üí´"
10shrwt,"Yeah i found a reputable brand in Canada that had a 50% off sale. HBE (happy bear edibles). I bought a ""few"" bottles of 30."
10shrwt,Who knew! Glad this sub talks about these things. Women here providing recommendations are gold stars.
10shrwt,Delta 8 has been a game changer sometimes 9 when anxiety gets really bad .
10shrwt,Yay! Jerome Flynn‚Äôs back to sleep meditation is my favorite.
10shrwt,"I hear you, I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs very very weird for me to wake up this early and not want to murder everyone but I know it‚Äôs definitely a far more normal wake up time than 3am."
10shrwt,Or charge a ‚Äúsleepless‚Äù fee like almost every entity these days üòúüòÇ
10shrwt,Melatonin makes my sleep worse as do all sleeping agents.
10shrwt,"You tried it in the middle of the night? Melatonin would never get me to
Sleeep initially but it does help get me back to sleep in the middle of the night so long as I chew it up in the dark and don‚Äôt look at any lights"
10shrwt,I was hoping you‚Äôd like that. Lol
10shrwt,"I do work but make my own schedule. However I wish I could sleep normal hours and do normal things, it's very very frustrating."
10shrwt,"I‚Äôm a housewife but my poor husband is still in the office regularly. Of course he can sleep through anything! 

Being a housewife means I *can* be a zombie sometimes except when I‚Äôm responsible for my grandkids. Then it‚Äôs all hands on deck!!"
10shrwt,Will be looking for some at local dispensaries TODAY. Thanks for the rec‚Äîfingers crossed!!
10shrwt,Will look into those. Thank you!
10shrwt,Will try this. Thanks!
10shrwt,[Chill Bites - they work wonders!! ‚úÖ](https://selectcbd.com/products/select-cbd-bites-chill-bites)
10shrwt,Writing that down because I won‚Äôt be able to remember it for even 10 minutes. Thanks!
10shrwt,"Pain is pain, right? I‚Äôll bet my 2:30 wake-ups would make some people cry with relief."
10shrwt,"There‚Äôs just no winning with this menopause thing, is there?!"
10shrwt,I‚Äôve tried regular melatonin before I go to sleep followed by a quick-dissolve version four hours later when I wake up. No joy.
10shrwt,"But you get to love on some grandkids, so hopefully that helps. Bet you collapse when they‚Äôre gone, though! ü•¥"
10shrwt,I recommend the THC gummies! They even have them with melatonin.
10shrwt,Good luck. Just know that some suggest to start at a low dose say 5mg and go up from there to find a dose that works. I found a site that recommends doses based on weight. I went over mine a bit because I tossed a lot and couldn't find any low dose gummies without THC in my local area as I don't want the hallucinogen in my system.
10shrwt,"Also look into Andrew Huberman. He‚Äôs a neuroscientist at Stanford Medical School. Andrew Huberman's Sleep Cocktail: Magnesium Threonate or Bisglycinate, Apigenin, & Theanine. Huberman recommends magnesium threonate or bisglycinate, apigenin, & theanine to aid in falling asleep faster and stay asleep longer."
10shrwt,"If you live in GTA (toronto), I'd give you my bottle of ashwaganda pills as they never worked for me. :P"
10shrwt,Good to know if I ever move to USA!
10shrwt,"IDK - I'm not a fan of taking pills or drugs but for treating this, I need to. And transdermal creams."
10shrwt,"Oh yeah no that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm suggesting. A jar of gummy melatonin next to the bed. When you wake up, keep the lights off and chew one up. It‚Äôs important not to look at lights or turn lights on or even look At your phone. Pee in the dark if you need to. Then eat a gummy melatonin in the dark
To get back to
Sleep"
10shrwt,Oh yes! I sure love them but they wear me out!
10shrwt,Melatonin doesn't work for us.
10shrwt,"THC gave me a panic attack and my body was shaking really bad. I called an ambulance and they said that it is from the THC. They said that THC has a calming effect for most people but for some it can give them a panic attack and hallucinations. It was really bad for me. My blood pressure went really high, I had palpitations, very dry mouth. I guess pot is not for me üòî."
10shrwt,"Link to site please? Ty, in advance fit a link if you have, & ty now for all the info already provided :)"
10shrwt,"Was just reading about him! He came up in search results after I saw the comment from u/emily_postal. Seems promising. Thanks!

EDIT: For anyone else who might be interested, here‚Äôs the link to more info about his ‚Äúsleep cocktail‚Äù.

10shrwt,"Other side of the continent, sadly. Since different things work for different peeps, I wish there was a way we could all swap around our tried-and-fails."
10shrwt,"Same re meds‚Äîbut at this point, I‚Äôll try anything. I‚Äôm thinking of seeing if I can do a sleep clinic, but I really don‚Äôt have much hope that it would help."
10shrwt,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing-I pop a quick-dissolve pill into my mouth that I keep by my bed for that purpose. It dissolves/gets chewed and should take effect within 30 mins. No lights, minimal movement."
10shrwt,[Here](https://startsleeping.org/cbd-dosage/)
10shrwt,"I bought all of those and I was up all night. So just know, your mileage may vary. Some said that theanine has the opposite effect and stimulates them, so that may be it, but it was so bad, I haven't taken the apigenin or the theanine since. Not happy that I spent a bunch of money only for it to make things for worse. Personally, I think people with general insomnia are different than those of us experiencing problems due to peri/menopause. I do take magnesium glycinate before bed. That plus changing my diet and cutting out caffeine has been the best help for me personally."
10shrwt,"Probably not. Seems most peri women suffer from this and each needs to find what works for them. Most say more P or E works, but for me nope."
10shrwt,"Idk what a quick Dissolve is but I‚Äôd be leery of it if it‚Äôs not working. I‚Äôm talking about gummies - these here https://imgur.com/a/EhIz8NR

I‚Äôd guess that like other supplements (biotin especially) all brands and forms are not the same."
10shrwt,Ty!
10shrwt,"Hey, can I ask if you‚Äôre on HRT as well?"
10shrwt,"Seems they work well for some and not for others. I was just telling hubby I don‚Äôt want to lay out a couple of hundred dollars for supplements only to discover they don‚Äôt work. (He of course said I should try whatever I think might help.)

Did you try the light/visual processes he recommends as well?"
10shrwt,"My doc increased my progesterone this week, so I‚Äôm hoping to see some effect from that, but that‚Äôs mostly because I‚Äôm a positive thinker by habit. Well, I usually am. That‚Äôs been a harder habit to keep lately."
10shrwt,"Yes, I am and that includes 200 mg of progesterone that is supposed to help with sleep. The hot flashes stopped with HRT, but  my sleep was still not great. I was using edibles until I took a new job that required a blood test, so I decided to make some drastic changes. I hate that so much of it is trial and error, which gets expensive!"
10shrwt,"Yeah, I had mine increased to 200 / night - zero effect on better sleep. My Dr then suggested other supplements which I've decided not to try (have carbs which while doing keto makes it really hard) and IMO taking a gummy is just easier (sure it has carbs but it works) other supp's don't seem to. It's been a year. I need my sleep now."
10shrwt,"Shoot, I was afraid you were going to say that. (I‚Äôm on progesterone, too.) Totally agree about the hit-or-miss. We need an exchange so we can try each other‚Äôs castoffs!"
10shrwt,"Well, poop."
